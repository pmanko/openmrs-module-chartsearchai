// Post-deploy gate: assert the deployed SPA actually loads the Chart Search AI ESM.
//
// Why this exists. The deploy wrapper's exit code says the compose project was
// acted on, not that a clinician can see the feature. On 2026-08-25 the deploy
// was green and the backend module was loaded and healthy — drugreferencestatus
// reported 2283 entries — while the AI icon was absent from every patient
// chart, because a stale pre-compressed importmap (importmap.json.br, and .gz
// beside it) in the frontend image shadowed the assembled one and the browser
// never imported the ESM. Nothing in the deploy workflow could have said so.
//
// Why a browser rather than curl, and why HEADED. Three measurements, 2026-08-25:
//
//   1. The instance is behind Cloudflare, which answers a plain request with
//      403 and a managed challenge — on every path tried
//      (/openmrs/ws/rest/v1/session, /openmrs/spa/importmap.json,
//      /openmrs/index.htm), with and without a browser User-Agent. A
//      curl-based gate cannot reach the origin, so it would assert nothing
//      while looking green.
//   2. HEADLESS Chromium is challenged too: the page never leaves the
//      interstitial (title stays "Loading …") and an in-page fetch throws.
//      Headed Chromium cleared the challenge and read the importmap at t+10s.
//      So this launches headed and CI runs it under xvfb.
//   3. The regression itself is only visible to a client that asks for a
//      compressed response. The frontend image's nginx serves <file>.br or
//      <file>.gz when one exists, trying .br first; a plain curl sends no
//      Accept-Encoding, and measured directly against the image it read the
//      CORRECT plain importmap while both compressed siblings were stale.
//      Every browser asks for br and gzip; so does fetch() here.
//
// A second failure class, measured 2026-09-15 and the reason for the sha stamp below. A green
// build and a green deploy left the served ESM directory holding files from TWO builds — the
// numbered chunks from the current one, the ENTRY bundle the importmap names from a build 11
// hours older. Chunk ids are per-build, so the old entry requested the old build's chunks and
// the new ones were never loaded; the merged feature did not render. Everything this gate
// checked was correct at the time, and the entry is byte-identical in size across those two
// builds (83,245), so nothing comparing names or sizes could see it. Hence: ask the deployment
// which commit it is serving, and whether the entry pre-dates that build.
//
// This reads only files nginx serves statically, so it does not wait on
// OpenMRS's own startup, which can run to 30 minutes on a first boot.
//
// Usage: xvfb-run -a node assert-spa-serves-chartsearchai.mjs [baseUrl]

// Imported inside the run block, not here, so the self-test beside this file can drive `probe`,
// `readHead`, `entryUrlFrom` and `problemsWith` without playwright installed at all.
