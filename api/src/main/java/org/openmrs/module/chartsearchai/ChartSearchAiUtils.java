	 * compare {@code resourceType} itself, so the split stays in one place as further kinds of
	 * injected record are added — several exist already, and they do not all fall on the same side
	 * (see below).
	 *
	 * <p>Four behaviours now hang off this one classification, not just the display grouping. The
	 * demote-only grounding carve-out in {@code CitationGroundingVerifier} is derived from it via
	 * {@link #isGroundingDemoteOnly}. That gate used to test the {@code drug_reference} type directly,
	 * so when {@code safety_finding} arrived (#110) it was classified here and NOT registered there,
	 * and the module's own deterministic findings were graded as retrieved chart evidence — publishing
	 * unstable {@code grounded} verdicts with no error anywhere (issue #122). Deriving both from one
	 * classification is what makes that class of omission unrepresentable, and it is why editing this
	 * method now also changes whether a type's citations can be verified. Those two are swept off one
	 * enumeration in {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroupTest}. The third is the wire: since #201 a
	 * reference-group citation publishes no verdict at all, so editing this method also changes what a
	 * CLIENT can see — swept off its own enumeration in
	 * {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroundingWithholdingTest}, in the omod module, because that is
	 * where the serializer lives.
	 *
	 * <p>The fourth is prompt COST: {@link #referenceSlice} measures how much of an assembled chart is
	 * reference material, which is the durable observable issue #229 asks for. It reads this
	 * classification rather than a list of type names for the same reason the other three do — so a
	 * further injected kind is measured automatically instead of being silently omitted — and the
	 * fail-safe below means it UNDER-reports an unrecognised type rather than over-reporting it,
	 * which is the safe direction for a number an operator reads as a floor on prompt spend.
	 *
	 * <p>The two groups are exhaustive because exactly two code paths mint a
	 * {@code RecordMapping}: {@code PatientChartSerializer}, which passes through whatever
	 * type querystore retrieved, and {@code DrugReferenceInjector}, which writes
	 * {@code drug_reference}, {@code safety_finding}, {@code drug_class_note} and
	 * {@code active_drug_order}. Not everything
	 * injected is reference material: an {@code active_drug_order} record is the patient's own
	 * active order, read from {@code OrderService} when the retrieved chart cannot substantiate it,
	 * so it groups as chart evidence — which is also what the fallback below yields, deliberately
	 * rather than by omission (the decision is recorded in {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroupTest}).
	 *
	 * <p>Anything unrecognised — including {@code null} — fails safe to chart evidence.
	 * Labelling an unknown type as reference material would assert a module provenance we
	 * cannot demonstrate; grouping it as chart evidence keeps it in the main list where it is

	 * unit under entailment, where the stronger #302 rule withholds even that; nothing downstream sees
	 * the difference, since #201 withholds every reference-group verdict at the wire.) True exactly for {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#REFERENCE_GROUP_REFERENCE} material: this
	 * is a named view of {@link #referenceGroup}, not a second classification, so there is no list of
	 * type names here to fall out of step with that one.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>This is the grading rule, not the wire — and since issue #284 it also decides one
	 * CHART citation's published verdict.</strong> A chart citation whose claim rests on a record
	 * this predicate calls reference material has its entailment NEGATIVE withheld, so what is
	 * classified here is no longer the only citation affected by the classification. The rest of
	 * this paragraph is about the classified citation's own verdict. Since issue #201 the REST layer
	 * publishes no verdict at all for reference material — {@code grounded} serializes as
	 * {@code null} for a {@code reference}-group citation whatever this pass concluded, at every
	 * emission site (see {@code ChartSearchAiRestController.groundedForWire}). The surviving
	 * {@code false} below is therefore module-internal: still computed, still returned on
	 * {@code RecordReference.getGrounded()}, and no longer published — because its meaning is
	 * "off-topic citation" and reading it as anything else renders the module's own deterministic
	 * finding as unsupported. Note that the Tier-2 exclusion, the {@code TRUE}-to-{@code null}
	 * demotion and the composite-claim withholding above are driven by THIS predicate rather than by
	 * that verdict — but it is not the only thing that holds a verdict back:
	 * {@code CitationGroundingVerifier} treats a COMPOUND claim unit (issue #302) — a fact about the
	 * shape of the claim rather than the provenance of the record — more strictly still. That one
	 * publishes nothing in either direction and skips Tier-1 as well as Tier-2, under entailment only,
	 * where this predicate demotes in either mode and — except where the two overlap, and the stronger
	 * rule wins — keeps its cosine FAIL. So the two are not the same treatment, and a citation can be
	 * held back without this predicate being true of it: by that rule, by a citation the MODULE
	 * attached rather than the model emitting it (issue #305), and by whatever else
	 * {@code CitationGroundingVerifier.Disposition} names — that enum is canonical for the set and
	 * for how much of a verdict each leaves.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>Why module-supplied material cannot be verified.</strong> An answer sentence citing
	 * module-rendered reference prose is typically a recitation of it, and a recitation embeds
	 * near-identically to its source whether or not it swaps subject roles ("erythromycin decreases X"
	 * against the record's "ivosidenib decreases X … including erythromycin"). The same lexical
	 * containment defeats the Tier-2 judge: measured on the live pipeline, 4/4 role-swapped
	 * recitations were judged entailed while the one faithful recitation was judged not (issue #106).
	 * A passing verdict is therefore false assurance. A FAILING verdict still carries information — it
	 * says the citation is not about the record at all — so the flag is kept and only the pass is
	 * withheld. Faithfulness of reference content is checked deterministically instead, by exact
	 * comparisons that run after every answer — and {@code CitationGroundingVerifier}'s class javadoc
	 * is where they are enumerated, along with the post-answer check that is NOT one of them because
	 * it reads no reference content at all. Pointed at rather than copied here, so that this site
	 * cannot fall behind the family again. NOT
	 * by the {@code DrugSafetyValidator} chips, which this javadoc said until #337: they carry the
	 * deterministic text but are an independent list nothing reconciles against the answer.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>It follows from provenance, not from being injected.</strong> An
	 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_ACTIVE_DRUG_ORDER} record is injected yet groups as
	 * chart evidence — one drug name asserted of this patient, carrying the real {@code Order} uuid,
	 * with no subject roles to swap — so it is graded normally; demoting it would strip the
	 * faithfulness check from the very record injected to stop the answer contradicting the safety
	 * chips (#118). <b>"One drug name" is the ordinary shape and not every shape</b>: an order the
	 * module can read no name for renders as its ATC codes alone, so that record asserts no drug and
	 * the clause above does not hold of it. It stays graded regardless — issue #294 asked what that
	 * costs before anything is changed, and ADR Decision 38's owed-measurement section is the answer,
	 * including what a type-keyed carve-out here was measured to cost — which is NOT the
	 * display-keyed, wire-sited remedy that issue proposes.
	 *
	 * <p>Conversely a {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_SAFETY_FINDING} is
	 * patient-specific but module-derived, and its rendering ("&lt;Drug&gt; interacts with active order
	 * &lt;Partner&gt; — Major. &lt;mechanism&gt;") is precisely the role-swappable prose above, which is why
	 * grading it produced verdicts that tracked embedding noise rather than the finding (issue #122).
	 *
	 * <p><strong>The unrecognised-type fallback grades normally</strong>, following
	 * {@link #referenceGroup}'s fail-safe, and that is deliberate in this direction too: querystore
	 * passes through chart types this module declares no constant for ({@code visit},
	 * {@code encounter} …), so demoting unknown types would silently stop verifying

	 * literal — rather than as a {@code RESOURCE_TYPE_*} constant, which

	 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/151">#151</a> records as
	 * having let two layers disagree about the patient's own orders, silently and in one direction.
	 * That accessor is also not enough on its own: the note is raised only where the question resolved
	 * NO substance, and only where question-driven injection is enabled at all, neither of which it
	 * asks. Reading the injector's own output makes the wire statement true exactly when the prompt
	 * carries the note, by construction rather than by agreement.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It names the ONE type deliberately, and that is not the hardcode
	 * {@link #referenceGroup} forbids.</b> That rule is about GROUPING questions — asking whether a
	 * citation is reference material by naming a type is how {@code safety_finding} was graded as
	 * chart evidence (issue
	 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/122">#122</a>). This
	 * asks which record states a class, and exactly one type does; a fourth reference-group type
	 * added later states nothing about a class and must not be picked up here.
	 *
	 * <p>The value is the note's {@code resourceUuid}, which for this type is the class name and not

	 * {@code resourceKey(type, drug)} — written in exactly one place,
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.injectRecords}, which is also {@code resourceKey}'s only
	 * production caller — so the drug is everything after the first {@code :}. Split it here and
	 * never at a call site: the finding's TYPE varies over one subject (an interaction and an
	 * allergy contraindication about one drug are two keys), so a caller comparing whole keys would
	 * read one drug as two, and one comparing type prefixes would read two drugs as one. That
	 * arrangement ships — a recorded allergy beside an interacting active order, both about the drug

	 * {@code FindingEnumerationClauseContextTest.aChartWhoseFindingsMixTypesAboutOneDrugAsksForOneLinePerFinding}
	 * is the one that reddens on {@code subjects.add(key)}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What the answer is NOT.</b> {@code SafetyWarning.getDrug()}'s own javadoc says it is
	 * neither a per-finding identity nor a stable substance name to group on, and this does not
	 * pretend otherwise: two spellings of one substance count as two subjects here. The direction
	 * that costs is therefore the safe one — a chart whose findings really are about one drug under

	 * does not — do not read it as catching every respelling.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why it is one method.</b> Three questions are asked of this population in one request, at
	 * two different moments. Before the answer: its SIZE, because the #397 clause needs more than one
	 * finding, and {@link #findingSubjects}, because that clause is about "the drug" and needs the

	 * {@code carriedFindingIndexes}.
	 * Only the projection differs. Spelled twice, a filter added to one would drift from the other
	 * silently, so that the prompt asks for an enumeration of a population {@code findingCitations}
	 * then counts differently — which is the state this method was extracted out of, the two
	 * spellings having been character-for-character identical in two classes.
	 *
	 * <p>A {@code List} rather than a Set, so the projection decides its own collapse: the index set
	 * is unique by construction (the injector's own sequential numbering) while two findings about
	 * one drug are two records and one subject, and a Set here would have to pick one of those.
	 *
	 * <p>Null-tolerant in two DIMENSIONS: a null list answers empty, and a null mapping inside a
	 * non-null list is skipped. {@link #referenceSlice} and {@link #unresolvedDrugClass} are of the

	 *         <p>Issue <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/337">
	 *         #337</a>'s third round, and it is shared rather than local because its callers must
	 *         agree or the check between them is unsound: {@code DrugReferenceInjector} asks it
	 *         whether an injected finding's RECORD states the finding's rating, and
	 *         {@code SafetyFindingSeverityFidelityCheck} asks it whether the ANSWER does. Were those
	 *         two rules to differ, a rating the record states one way and the answer states the other
	 *         would be reported as dropped, or a rating neither states would be asked for.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Deliberately not {@code DrugReference}'s bounded-token family, and not a member
	 *         of it — but not because the rules differ.</b> At {@code PROSE_TRAILING_LETTERS}
	 *         (zero) that family's {@code containsWord} reduces to this same condition, and a review
	 *         pass drove both over 175 pairs to confirm it: they agree on every one but an accented
	 *         needle. So the reason is NOT that this question "has no allowance to choose", which an
	 *         earlier draft of this javadoc said in four places and which is false of
	 *         {@code containsWord} too. Two reasons hold. That family FOLDS DIACRITICS and this
	 *         deliberately does not — a rating is the module's own closed vocabulary, so an accented
	 *         spelling of it is not a thing to accommodate, while folding one silently would widen
	 *         what an answer may say. And {@code containsWord} is package-private in the drug-safety
	 *         package, so reaching it from {@code api.impl} means widening the drug-name matcher out
	 *         of the package whose instructions bind it (#260). It is a boundary rule beside that
	 *         family rather than inside it — {@code DrugReference.boundedTokenIndex}'s javadoc
	 *         enumerates the routes that share ITS scan, and this is not one of them.
	 *
	 *         <p>The boundary admits every way a rating has been observed to be written — a colon
	 *         after it, parentheses or markdown emphasis around it, a hyphen before {@code -rated} —
	 *         and refuses only a longer word it sits inside, {@code majority} being the one that
	 *         matters, since it is ordinary in clinical prose.
	 *
	 *         <p>A null or blank {@code word} answers false rather than matching everything: an empty
	 *         needle would otherwise match at the first position with non-alphanumeric neighbours —
	 *         any {@code ". "} — and a check silenced by a blank is a check that fails open. <b>The
	 *         blank half of that guard is UNPINNED</b>: weakening it to a null test leaves the suite
	 *         green, because no production caller can reach here with a blank
	 *         ({@code statableRating} answers a trimmed non-blank or null). It is contract for a
	 *         public method rather than a reachable path, and said so rather than left looking
	 *         better defended than it is.
