	 *
	 *         <p><b>The elision carve-out is where that direction is spent.</b> An ASCII elision is a
	 *         run of a member of this set, so where {@code aMarkedCutEndsIt} is FALSE a marked cut is
	 *         the one gap SHAPE whose answer this rule moved — from silence to a report. It is not
	 *         the only gap this predicate answers no for; a plain space is the ordinary case. What
	 *         that buys, what it costs and why one operand asks for it and the other does not are
	 *         {@code ReferenceProseFidelityCheck}'s to state, since that class passes both values:
	 *         read its class javadoc, and ADR Decision 95, which is canonical for the measurement.
	 *         The rule steps OVER the run rather than answering for the whole gap, so a line break or
	 *         a second terminator beside the cut still ends the sentence. Asking
	 *         {@code SENTENCE_BOUNDARY} instead spends that direction everywhere rather than at one
	 *         marked cut, and was measured rather than argued: it
	 *         requires the terminator to be followed IMMEDIATELY by whitespace, so a quotation the
	 *         model closed — {@code ."} or {@code .)} , and this module's own reference prose is full
	 *         of {@code (SSRIs)} and {@code (M1)} — is not a boundary, and a faithful quotation
	 *         followed by the model's own next sentence was reported as a substitution.
	 *
	 *         <p>It must not be used to SPLIT a text into units: {@code Q12H. }-shaped prose and an
	 *         abbreviation dot both answer yes here, and a splitter that believed them would cut a
	 *         sentence in half. That is {@link #SENTENCE_BOUNDARY}'s question, and the two are kept
	 *         apart for the reason issue #260 records — one rule, one terminator set, one named entry

	 * injected record are added — several exist already, and they do not all fall on the same side
	 * (see below).
	 *
	 * <p>Four behaviours now hang off this one classification, not just the display grouping. The

	 * {@link #isGroundingDemoteOnly}. That gate used to test the {@code drug_reference} type directly,

	 * and the module's own deterministic findings were graded as retrieved chart evidence — publishing
	 * unstable {@code grounded} verdicts with no error anywhere (issue #122). Deriving both from one
	 * classification is what makes that class of omission unrepresentable, and it is why editing this
	 * method now also changes whether a type's citations can be verified. Those two are swept off one
	 * enumeration in {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroupTest}. The third is the wire: since #201 a
	 * reference-group citation publishes no verdict at all, so editing this method also changes what a
	 * CLIENT can see — swept off its own enumeration in
	 * {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroundingWithholdingTest}, in the omod module, because that is
	 * where the serializer lives.
	 *
	 * <p>The fourth is prompt COST: {@link #referenceSlice} measures how much of an assembled chart is
	 * reference material, which is the durable observable issue #229 asks for. It reads this
	 * classification rather than a list of type names for the same reason the other three do — so a
	 * further injected kind is measured automatically instead of being silently omitted — and the
	 * fail-safe below means it UNDER-reports an unrecognised type rather than over-reporting it,
	 * which is the safe direction for a number an operator reads as a floor on prompt spend.
	 *
	 * <p>The two groups are exhaustive because exactly two code paths mint a
	 * {@code RecordMapping}: {@code PatientChartSerializer}, which passes through whatever
	 * type querystore retrieved, and {@code DrugReferenceInjector}, which writes
	 * {@code drug_reference}, {@code safety_finding}, {@code drug_class_note} and

	 * injected is reference material: an {@code active_drug_order} record is the patient's own
	 * active order, read from {@code OrderService} when the retrieved chart cannot substantiate it,
	 * so it groups as chart evidence — which is also what the fallback below yields, deliberately
	 * rather than by omission (the decision is recorded in {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroupTest}).
	 *
	 * <p>Anything unrecognised — including {@code null} — fails safe to chart evidence.

	 * pass. (The {@code false} survives except where such a citation also sits inside a compound claim
	 * unit under entailment, where the stronger #302 rule withholds even that; nothing downstream sees
	 * the difference, since #201 withholds every reference-group verdict at the wire.) True exactly for {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#REFERENCE_GROUP_REFERENCE} material: this
	 * is a named view of {@link #referenceGroup}, not a second classification, so there is no list of
	 * type names here to fall out of step with that one.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>This is the grading rule, not the wire — and since issue #284 it also decides one
	 * CHART citation's published verdict.</strong> A chart citation whose claim rests on a record
	 * this predicate calls reference material has its entailment NEGATIVE withheld, so what is
	 * classified here is no longer the only citation affected by the classification. The rest of
	 * this paragraph is about the classified citation's own verdict. Since issue #201 the REST layer
	 * publishes no verdict at all for reference material — {@code grounded} serializes as
	 * {@code null} for a {@code reference}-group citation whatever this pass concluded, at every
	 * emission site (see {@code ChartSearchAiRestController.groundedForWire}). The surviving
	 * {@code false} below is therefore module-internal: still computed, still returned on
	 * {@code RecordReference.getGrounded()}, and no longer published — because its meaning is
	 * "off-topic citation" and reading it as anything else renders the module's own deterministic
	 * finding as unsupported. Note that the Tier-2 exclusion, the {@code TRUE}-to-{@code null}
	 * demotion and the composite-claim withholding above are driven by THIS predicate rather than by
	 * that verdict — but it is not the only thing that holds a verdict back:
	 * {@code CitationGroundingVerifier} treats a COMPOUND claim unit (issue #302) — a fact about the
	 * shape of the claim rather than the provenance of the record — more strictly still. That one
	 * publishes nothing in either direction and skips Tier-1 as well as Tier-2, under entailment only,
	 * where this predicate demotes in either mode and — except where the two overlap, and the stronger
	 * rule wins — keeps its cosine FAIL. So the two are not the same treatment, and a citation can be
	 * held back without this predicate being true of it: by that rule, by a citation the MODULE
	 * attached rather than the model emitting it (issue #305), and by whatever else
	 * {@code CitationGroundingVerifier.Disposition} names — that enum is canonical for the set and
	 * for how much of a verdict each leaves.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>Why module-supplied material cannot be verified.</strong> An answer sentence citing
	 * module-rendered reference prose is typically a recitation of it, and a recitation embeds
	 * near-identically to its source whether or not it swaps subject roles ("erythromycin decreases X"
	 * against the record's "ivosidenib decreases X … including erythromycin"). The same lexical
	 * containment defeats the Tier-2 judge: measured on the live pipeline, 4/4 role-swapped
	 * recitations were judged entailed while the one faithful recitation was judged not (issue #106).
	 * A passing verdict is therefore false assurance. A FAILING verdict still carries information — it
	 * says the citation is not about the record at all — so the flag is kept and only the pass is
	 * withheld. Faithfulness of reference content is checked deterministically instead, by exact
	 * comparisons that run after every answer — and {@code CitationGroundingVerifier}'s class javadoc
	 * is where they are enumerated, along with the post-answer check that is NOT one of them because
	 * it reads no reference content at all. Pointed at rather than copied here, so that this site
	 * cannot fall behind the family again. NOT
	 * by the {@code DrugSafetyValidator} chips, which this javadoc said until #337: they carry the
	 * deterministic text but are an independent list nothing reconciles against the answer.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>It follows from provenance, not from being injected.</strong> An
	 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_ACTIVE_DRUG_ORDER} record is injected yet groups as
	 * chart evidence — one drug name asserted of this patient, carrying the real {@code Order} uuid,
	 * with no subject roles to swap — so it is graded normally; demoting it would strip the
	 * faithfulness check from the very record injected to stop the answer contradicting the safety
	 * chips (#118). <b>"One drug name" is the ordinary shape and not every shape</b>: an order the
	 * module can read no name for renders as its ATC codes alone, so that record asserts no drug and
	 * the clause above does not hold of it. <b>This method is still not where that is answered, and
	 * issue #294 did not change it.</b> Such a record is chart evidence, so a carve-out here would
	 * withhold the verdict of every {@code active_drug_order} citation including the named ones — the
	 * cost ADR Decision 38's remedies sub-section measured. It is held back at the grading layer
	 * instead, per RECORD rather than per type, by
	 * {@code CitationGroundingVerifier.Disposition.UNVERIFIABLE} off the mapping's own
	 * {@code orderDrugNamed} stamp, which is canonical for the reasoning.
	 *
	 * <p>Conversely a {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_SAFETY_FINDING} is
	 * patient-specific but module-derived, and its rendering ("&lt;Drug&gt; interacts with active order
	 * &lt;Partner&gt; — Major. &lt;mechanism&gt;") is precisely the role-swappable prose above, which is why
	 * grading it produced verdicts that tracked embedding noise rather than the finding (issue #122).
	 *
	 * <p><strong>The unrecognised-type fallback grades normally</strong>, following
	 * {@link #referenceGroup}'s fail-safe, and that is deliberate in this direction too: querystore
	 * passes through chart types this module declares no constant for ({@code visit},

	 * {@code MAX_INTERACTION_RENDER_CHARS} is a per-RECORD budget, so N records cost N times it, and
	 * the only signal that any of it happened was one DEBUG line. On OpenMRS the {@code log.level}
	 * global property is not applied at startup, so that line is not reachable by configuration
	 * alone — the prompt slice a clinician's answer was built from could not be measured after the
	 * fact at all. This is the derivation the durable channel reads:
	 * {@code ChartAnswer.getReferenceSlice()} carries it to the audit row.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it counts, stated so the number is not read as more than it is.</b> It counts every
	 * mapping the chart carries whose type {@link #referenceGroup} calls reference material — not
	 * "everything the injector added", which is a different and wrong set: an
	 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_ACTIVE_DRUG_ORDER} record is injected and is the
	 * patient's own prescription, so it groups as chart evidence and is outside this number. Nor is
	 * it a claim about who MINTED the record: {@code PatientChartSerializer} passes through whatever
	 * type querystore retrieved, so a reference-group type arriving that way would be counted here —
	 * which is the honest reading for a prompt-cost figure, since the cost is the same whoever wrote
	 * the line.
	 *
	 * <p>Characters are the rendered record text, which is what the model reads and what crowds out
	 * chart records, and it excludes the {@code "[N] "} citation prefix and the newline the chart's own
	 * assembly adds. Scope the reading of that to the injector's records, which is where every
	 * reference-group record comes from today: there the mapping text and the chart line are
	 * byte-identical by construction, so the total is a floor on the bytes spent. It is not a general
	 * property of a {@code RecordMapping} — {@code PatientChartSerializer} carries an inline date and
	 * group label on the mapping that the chart line run-length-dedups away — so were a reference-group
	 * type ever to arrive through querystore, its characters could exceed what the prompt spent on it.

	 *
	 * <p><b>The population is the markers the ANSWER printed, intersected with what the answer's own
	 * resolution admitted.</b> {@link #citedIndexes} decodes the markers, and the {@code cited} list
	 * is the resolution: an index is not a citation until that resolution admits it. Both halves are

	 * {@code citation} — documented as the number the answer printed in brackets — would name a
	 * number that appears nowhere in the answer. Taking the markers alone would admit an index the

	 *
	 * <p><b>A BLANK answer states nothing here, which is the OPPOSITE of the convention its

	 * structured {@code citations} array is reachable and yields an empty list.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Gated on the STAMP and never on a resource type.</b> A record states a stop date only
	 * where {@code RecordMapping.getOrderStopDate()} carries one, which the chart builder writes only
	 * for a drug-order record of this patient's that it read as out of force — so the type scoping
	 * lives once, at the write, and asking for the type again here would be a second expression of

	 *

	 *         #337</a>'s third round, and it is shared rather than local because its callers must

	 *         two rules to differ, a rating the record states one way and the answer states the other
	 *         would be reported as dropped, or a rating neither states would be asked for.
	 *
	 *         <p>Since issue #276 it is one of TWO questions over one scan — see
	 *         {@link #statesMeasurement}, which the dosing-ceiling check asks instead because its
	 *         needle begins with a number. Adding a question means adding an entry point beside
	 *         these, never widening one of them: this one's boundary is what a WORD needs, and
	 *         {@link #numericFragment} is what a number needs. What the second would cost the first
	 *         is that paragraph's to say, not this one's.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Deliberately not {@code DrugReference}'s bounded-token family, and not a member
	 *         of it — but not because the rules differ.</b> At {@code PROSE_TRAILING_LETTERS}
	 *         (zero) that family's {@code containsWord} reduces to this same condition, and a review
	 *         pass drove both over 175 pairs to confirm it: they agree on every one but an accented
	 *         needle. So the reason is NOT that this question "has no allowance to choose", which an
	 *         earlier draft of this javadoc said in four places and which is false of
	 *         {@code containsWord} too. Two reasons hold. That family FOLDS DIACRITICS and this
	 *         deliberately does not — a rating is the module's own closed vocabulary, so an accented
	 *         spelling of it is not a thing to accommodate, while folding one silently would widen
	 *         what an answer may say. And {@code containsWord} is package-private in the drug-safety
	 *         package, so reaching it from {@code api.impl} means widening the drug-name matcher out
	 *         of the package whose instructions bind it (#260). It is a boundary rule beside that
	 *         family rather than inside it — {@code DrugReference.boundedTokenIndex}'s javadoc
	 *         enumerates the routes that share ITS scan, and this is not one of them.
	 *
	 *         <p>The boundary admits every way a rating has been observed to be written — a colon
	 *         after it, parentheses or markdown emphasis around it, a hyphen before {@code -rated} —
	 *         and refuses only a longer word it sits inside, {@code majority} being the one that
	 *         matters, since it is ordinary in clinical prose.
	 *
	 *         <p>A null or blank {@code word} answers false rather than matching everything: an empty
	 *         needle would otherwise match at the first position with non-alphanumeric neighbours —
	 *         any {@code ". "} — and a check silenced by a blank is a check that fails open. <b>The
	 *         blank half of that guard is UNPINNED</b>: weakening it to a null test leaves the suite

	 * <p><b>A second entry point rather than a widened {@link #statesWord}, and rather than a test at
	 * the call site.</b> Two questions, two named entry points, one scan underneath, which is the
	 * shape {@code CLAUDE.md} prescribes for {@code SENTENCE_TERMINATORS}; what it forbids is a third
	 * dialect spelled at a call site, and the whole point of this method is that there is not one.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The split does NOT rest on a measured breakage, said so the argument does not look better
	 * defended than it is.</b> Give {@link #statesWord} this rule instead — delegate at {@code true}

	 * being refused after some punctuation, for a reason belonging to numbers, with nothing to catch
	 * it. Which spellings, exactly, is {@link #numericFragment}'s to say and moves when it does.
	 * That is the instruction's own reason for one entry point per operand shape, and it is the
	 * reason here — not a test that reddens.
	 *
	 * <p>It is asymmetric deliberately: only the LEADING edge takes the extra refusal. Every needle

	 * {@code formatNumber(v) + " mg/day"}), so the trailing character is a letter and

	 *         kept classifying the character before the FULL STOP was a list nobody can finish — so
	 *         the stop is asked instead whether it BEGINS a token, which is a property rather than a
	 *         membership, and the comma is asked about the digit before it and then about the LENGTHS
	 *         of the digit runs around it. <b>The residues that leaves, named here rather than left
	 *         to be found, and each unpinned</b>: a naked decimal written directly after an opening
	 *         mark with no space ({@code "(.5 mg/day)"}) is NOT refused, so a laxer ceiling can be
	 *         read out of it. The exception ADMITS two things that are no elided-unit list: a comma
	 *         decimal whose fraction is three digits long behind four or more
	 *         ({@code "1000,300 mg/day"}), and a PARTIALLY grouped number, one whose last group
	 *         alone is marked ({@code "20000,500 mg/day"} for 20,000,500). And it does NOT REACH a
	 *         list written any other way, so #425's own false report still stands for those — each
	 *         half leaving its own shapes behind. The run-length half leaves a first number of three
	 *         digits or fewer ({@code "600,500 mg/day"}). The tail test is an EQUALITY and not an
	 *         upper bound, so it leaves every ceiling whose number is not exactly three digits long,
	 *         in both directions: {@code "4000,2000 mg/day"} and {@code "2000,60 mg/day"}, both
	 *         measured refused, and this module's fixtures publish ceilings of each width.
	 *
	 *         <p>Moving the tail bound reaches further into what it admits AND into what it refuses:
	 *         {@code "1000,300 mg/day"} (a decimal) and {@code "4000,300 mg/day"} (the list #425
	 *         filed) are the same shape to a rule reading only the text. What could tell those two
	 *         apart is whether the number before the comma is another of the cited record's own
	 *         ceilings — evidence this method cannot see, being handed a text and a needle.
	 *         Each fixed shape is a case in {@code DosingCeilingFidelityTest} —
	 *         {@code .aDecimalInTheAnswerDoesNotSTATEACeilingItMerelyENDSWith},
	 *         {@code .aThousandsSeparatorInTheAnswerDoesNotSTATEACeilingItMerelyENDSWith},
