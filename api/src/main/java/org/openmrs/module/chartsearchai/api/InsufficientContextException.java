/**
 * Thrown when a patient's required clinical evidence (mandatory safety records plus exact,
 * typed-complete, and panel records) exceeds the LLM's available input budget before optional context is
 * even considered. Distinct from {@link ChartTooLargeException}: that one is llama-server's own
 * after-the-fact rejection of a prompt that turned out too big; this one is a proactive,
 * specifically-diagnosed abstention — the same {@code insufficient_context} outcome the
 * dual-provider conformance fixture's {@code context.mandatory-overflow-abstains} case and
 * med-agent-hub's {@code InsufficientContextError} already use. Mandatory evidence is never
 * droppable (querystore ADR Decision 17), so there is nothing left to trim — the turn must abstain rather
 * than silently omit safety-critical content.
