/**
 * A response body that stops instead of growing: it hands on at most {@code limit} bytes and then
 * raises {@link ResponseTooLargeException}.
 *
 * <p>Issue #446. The peer behind {@code chartsearchai.llm.remote.endpointUrl} is untrusted, and
 * both ways {@link RemoteLlmEngine} turns a SUCCESSFUL response into heap start by pulling bytes
 * out of one of these — so bounding the stream is what bounds both at once. A non-2xx body is
 * read by {@code RemoteLlmEngine.readTruncatedErrorBody} under its own, tighter ceiling and does
 * not come through here. The ceiling the
 * ticket asks for "per line, per chunk and cumulative" falls out of the cumulative one rather
 * than needing three counters: {@code BufferedReader.readLine()} cannot buffer a line the
 * stream never yielded, an SSE chunk cannot exceed what the line carried, and the parser's
 * accumulated text cannot exceed the chunks. A peer sending one endless line and a peer
 * sending endless short ones are the same peer here — pinned by
 * {@code RemoteLlmEngineResponseSizeBoundTest}'s
 * {@code oneEndlessLineIsCutOffEvenThoughTheParserNeverSeesAChunk} and
 * {@code endlessLinesCarryingNoContentAtAllAreStillCountedAgainstTheCeiling}, which are the
 * two shapes a ceiling counted on the parser's accumulated text lets through.</p>
 *
 * <p>Closing this closes the underlying body, which is what cancels the exchange and stops the peer
 * — so the caller that reads through it must close it on the failure path too. Every caller does,
 * by reading inside a try-with-resources.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Several clauses here are defence in depth and the suite does not discriminate them</b>,
 * said once rather than at each: the {@code len} clamp, the post-throw guard in each read,
 * {@link #skip}, and the single-byte {@link #read()} override ENTIRE — its counting included,
 * not merely its guard.
 * Measured against a loopback peer, production reaches this class through exactly two callers,
 * and neither skips, reads a byte at a time, asks for more than 16384 at once, or reads on after
 * the throw; each of those clauses can be deleted with every test still green. They are kept
 * because each closes a hole a future caller could open in the count, and named here because a
 * clause no test discriminates is one the next change can delete for free without knowing it. The
 * list is what was measured, not a proof that nothing else here is undiscriminated.</p>
