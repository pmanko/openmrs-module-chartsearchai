/**
 * Reports an answer whose CAUTION LEAD says a drug can be given beside a finding about that drug whose record
 * states a reason to withhold — that drug, or, for a question-pair finding, the pair's subject, which need
 * not be the lead's drug (see the list below; {@code ChartSearchService.CautionLedOverWithholding} is
 * canonical for what an entry asserts) — issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/515">#515</a>, ADR Decision 119.
 *
 * <p><b>The failure.</b> <em>"The patient is currently on Lamivudine, Nevirapine, Stavudine, is it safe to
 * give Amlodipine?"</em> came back from the default model as <em>"Amlodipine can be given, with one
 * caution: …"</em> while the prompt carried Amlodipine × rifampin, a Major finding against an order the
 * question's list left out, ending <em>"This finding is a reason to withhold it."</em>. Asked without the
 * list, the same model refused amlodipine on it. No key compared the lead with that finding.
 *
 * <p><b>What it reads.</b> The lead through {@link DrugSafetyValidator#cautionLead}, which is canonical
 * for the lead class and what its anchor refuses. The findings are the chart's injected
 * {@code safety_finding} records ({@link ChartSearchAiUtils#safetyFindingMappings}), cited or not: a record
 * carries the citation a client joins and the rating it states, and the records exist before the answer,
 * so the one report reaches the early {@code done} too — the chips do not, being raised after it. A record
 * is reported where {@link RecordMapping#getFindingWithholds()} is {@code TRUE} and
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#namesTheFindingsSubject} says the lead's drug is the substance of
 * {@link RecordMapping#getFindingSubjectRows()}. Neither is re-derived here, from the text or anywhere else.
 *
 * <p><b>What it cannot see</b>, stated so that {@code []} is not read as a certificate:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>any lead the anchor refuses — among them issue #513 item 2's recorded E2B shapes, a refusal and a
 *       "No" before a permission. That item is NOT delivered here and stays open on #513: its defect is a
 *       verdict on the drug asked that follows the LISTED drugs' findings, which a check of the lead's own
 *       drug's findings cannot report even where the anchor admits the lead (ADR Decision 119);</li>
 *   <li>a drug only the ANSWER put in play, which has chips and no record;</li>
 *   <li>a finding whose SUBJECT is another drug and whose partner is the lead's — except a question-pair
 *       finding, which states both of its drugs' rows, because that arm's subject is the drug the question
 *       proposes only where it proposes one of the two, and the dataset's order otherwise (ADR Decision
 *       133). Its clause stays the subject's, so an entry reported for the partner is a reason to withhold
 *       the OTHER drug of the pair;</li>
 *   <li>a pair finding the screening arm (the order-driven INTERACTION arm) raised, which states no
 *       subject rows. An order-driven contraindication does state them, through the step every
 *       contraindication passes, as do the drug-in-play arm's duplicate-therapy finding, by its drug in
 *       play's rows, and the finding that two of her orders share substances, by every substance it names,
 *       so that one is reported beside a lead on any of them.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>It reports the citation and the rating, never a word of the answer or of a record, and never that the
 * answer is wrong. It never rewrites the answer.
