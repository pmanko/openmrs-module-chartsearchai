/**
 * Checks that each cited record actually supports the answer sentence(s) that
 * cite it, rather than trusting the LLM's citations blindly.
 *
 * <p>{@link LlmInferenceService} already validates that a {@code [N]} marker
 * maps to a real retrieved record. That catches a model citing a record number
 * that does not exist, but not the more dangerous case of a real record cited
 * for a claim it does not support (e.g. "patient has diabetes [5]" where record
 * 5 is a blood-pressure reading). This verifier closes that gap with a Tier-1
 * semantic-overlap check: embed each cited record and the answer sentence(s)
 * that reference it, and require their cosine similarity to clear a tunable
 * floor ({@code chartsearchai.grounding.minCosine}). Below the floor, the
 * citation is annotated {@code grounded=false} so the UI can flag it. (When
 * Tier-2 entailment is enabled, this cosine pass runs lazily — see "Lazy
 * Tier-1 under entailment" below.)
 *
 * <p><strong>Scope and limits.</strong> This is intentionally an annotate-only,
 * non-destructive pass: it never rewrites the answer prose or drops citations,
 * it only attaches a verdict. Cosine overlap reliably separates off-topic
 * citations from on-topic ones, but it does <em>not</em> separate subtle
 * subject/polarity flips ("patient has X" vs "mother had X", "denies X" vs
 * "has X") — those embed nearly identically.
 *
 * <p><strong>Tier-2 (optional).</strong> When
 * {@code chartsearchai.grounding.entailment.enabled} is set, the cited references are
 * confirmed by a yes/no LLM entailment verdict that is authoritative, except where its answer is
 * decided by the pairing rather than earned by the record. This is what
 * catches the subject/polarity flips cosine cannot — for chart records; the citations excepted from
 * it are module-supplied reference material, a COMPOUND claim unit, a citation the MODULE attached
 * ({@link Disposition#UNVERIFIABLE}, issue #305) and — for its NEGATIVE only — a COMPOSITE claim,
 * each below or on the constant named for it. It runs on Tier-1 passes
 * <em>and</em> failures — the dangerous case (a high-overlap but unsupported
 * citation) is a Tier-1 pass, so confirming only failures would miss it. References are verified
 * in a SINGLE batched call ({@link LlmProvider#entailsBatch}) — except for the citations of ONE
 * sentence whose statements overlap, which are each verified in their OWN call: batched entailment
 * is NOT per-pair independent, so co-batching them lets the LLM couple their verdicts and silently
 * flip a correct citation to not-grounded. Two shapes qualify — a compound sentence under
 * clause-scoped grounding (whose cumulative-prefix statements differ only by length), and an
 * ENUMERATING sentence in either mode (whose per-item statements share a preamble, see
 * {@code splitEnumeration} and issue #278). The total is capped at
 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#GROUNDING_ENTAILMENT_MAX_CHECKS} pairs per answer;
 * references beyond the cap keep their Tier-1 verdict.
 *
 * <p><strong>Lazy Tier-1 under entailment.</strong> Because the Tier-2 verdict overrides Tier-1
 * wherever it lands, running the cosine pass eagerly for every reference would spend a full
 * embedding-model forward pass per record and per sentence — the dominant grounding cost on
 * CPU-only servers — on verdicts that are then discarded. So when entailment is enabled, Tier-1
 * embeds run only where they still decide something: choosing the claim sentence when more than
 * one candidate cites the record (the statement must be the cosine-best match, identical to the
 * eager path), and supplying the fallback verdict for references whose Tier-2 check produced none —
 * because it failed or could not answer (cap overflow, engine failure), or because it was never asked
 * AND a Tier-1 verdict could still be published, which since #302 means reference material but not a
 * compound claim unit — computed lazily, after Tier-2. A list-style
 * answer where each line cites its own record runs no Tier-1 embeds at all. A consequence pinned in
 * tests: a broken or absent Tier-1 embedding model no longer blocks Tier-2 verdicts for unambiguous
 * claim sentences the judge is ASKED about — previously it silently downgraded every citation to
 * "unverified". Since issue #302 it is not asked about a compound claim unit, and since #305 not
 * about a citation the module attached either (see {@link Disposition#UNVERIFIABLE}); the former on such a
 * deployment has no tier left and renders unverified; see the compound-claim paragraph below.
 *
 * <p><strong>Module-supplied reference citations are demote-only.</strong> A record whose
 * resource type groups as reference material
 * ({@link ChartSearchAiUtils#isGroundingDemoteOnly}) is module-rendered
 * reference prose, and an answer sentence citing it is typically a recitation of that
 * prose. A recitation embeds near-identically to its source whether or not it swaps
 * subject roles ("erythromycin decreases X" vs the record's "ivosidenib decreases X …
 * including erythromycin"), and the same lexical containment defeats the Tier-2 judge:
 * measured on the live pipeline, 4/4 role-swapped recitations were judged entailed while
 * the one faithful recitation was judged not (issue #106). So these citations never enter
 * Tier-2 (nor consume its per-answer cap), and Tier-1 can only <em>demote</em>: a cosine
 * fail still flags an off-topic citation ({@code grounded=false}), but a pass renders
 * {@code null} (unverified), never {@code true}. (Where such a citation also sits inside a compound
 * claim unit under entailment, the stronger rule below wins and even the fail is withheld — no
 * consumer can see the difference, since #201 withholds every reference-group verdict at the wire.)
 * Faithfulness of reference content is
 * checked deterministically instead, by the exact comparisons over what the answer states about
 * the record: {@link ClassCodeFidelityCheck} for an ATC class code the model edited while
 * citing the record that carries it (issue #142), report-only; {@link ReferenceProseFidelityCheck}
 * for a recitation the model diverged from inside the sentence it was copying (issue #337), whose
 * answer is published as {@code unfaithfullyRenderedCitations}; and
 * {@link SafetyFindingSeverityFidelityCheck} for a cited safety finding whose RATING the answer
 * states nowhere (the same issue, round three), published as {@code unstatedFindingSeverities}.
 * None of those is published as a verdict on these citations, which stay withheld.
 * {@link ActiveOrderCitationFidelityCheck} runs after every answer too and is NOT one of them: it
 * reads no reference content, asking instead which CHART record a sentence cited, published as
 * {@code misattributedOrderCitations}, and on the same walk whether any was offered at all,
 * published as {@code activeOrderClaims} (ADR Decisions 76, 81). NOT by the
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator} chips, which this javadoc named until #337: they carry the
 * deterministic text but are an independent list nothing reconciles against the answer. Accepted
 * cost: under entailment mode these citations now take the lazy Tier-1 path (up to two
 * embedding passes each) that the amortized Tier-2 batch previously spared them — the
 * off-topic flag is kept mode-uniform at the price of ~one embed pair per reference
 * citation on CPU deployments. That surviving {@code false} is a module-internal signal: since
 * issue #201 the REST layer publishes no verdict at all for a reference-group citation, because
 * its meaning is "off-topic citation" and a client reading it as "unsupported claim" renders the
 * module's own deterministic finding in red.
 *
 * <p>Which record types are reference material is
 * {@link org.openmrs.module.chartsearchai.ChartSearchAiUtils#referenceGroup}'s answer and not a list
 * kept here — the two this rule was written against being
 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_DRUG_REFERENCE}, the case #106 measured, and
 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_SAFETY_FINDING}, the deterministic drug-safety join
 * #110 injects as a citable record, with
 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_DRUG_CLASS_NOTE} joining them in issue #354. The
 * finding was graded as chart evidence until issue #122,
 * because this carve-out named the drug-reference type instead of deriving from the group; its
 * verdicts tracked embedding noise, and it also spent Tier-2 cap slots meant for chart claims. An
 * injected {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_ACTIVE_DRUG_ORDER} record is NOT reference
 * material and is graded normally — see the carve-out site in {@link #verify} for why that is
 * right, and why "the module injected it" is the wrong test.
 *
 * <p><strong>A COMPOUND claim unit is UNVERIFIABLE, which is stronger than demote-only.</strong> A claim unit
 * that attaches its citations to different pieces of its own text — more than one citation, with
 * claim text standing between two of its markers ({@link Sentence#compoundClaim()}) — states a
 * conjunction that no one cited record answers for all of. Asked to entail it, a correct judge
 * replies "no" whether the citation is right or wrong, so the verdict says nothing about the
 * citation; published, that is what marked correct, active, unvoided medication citations as
 * unsupported on the module's most common question — 8 of the 30 chart citations in #302's own
 * 12-patient sweep, all 8 in the colon-less multi-citation row. This rule reaches those of them whose
 * markers are separated by claim text; #302's closing sub-shape ({@code Salicylic acid [1], [2].}) is
 * co-citation by the definition below and stays graded, so the fix is not all 8.
 *
 * <p>Such citations never enter Tier-2, never consume its cap, and publish NO verdict at all —
 * {@code null} in either direction. Both tiers ask the wrong-sized question of them: the judge is
 * handed a conjunction the record answers for only part of, and the cosine that would stand in for it
 * is measured against that same conjunction, so a correct citation's score is diluted by the items it
 * is not cited for. Withholding only the pass and keeping the fail was measured to reintroduce this
 * issue's own harm — on the cell where a lenient judge's YES had rescued a diluted score, main
 * published {@code true} and that draft published {@code false}, Unsupported on a correct and active
 * citation. So nothing is published, and no embedding is spent computing a verdict that would be
 * discarded. {@code chartsearchai.grounding.clauseScoped} narrows the FIRST citation's claim to its own clause
 * and is the existing remedy for that one; it does not extend to the rest, whose cumulative prefix
 * still names the earlier items, and turning it on removes this rule rather than adding to it
 * (a single-cited fragment is not a compound claim unit).
 *
 * <p>The rule applies under ENTAILMENT ONLY. With Tier-2 off, cosine is not standing in for a judge
 * that could not be asked — it is the whole of what the mode promises, every verdict in it is that
 * same comparison, and withholding a compound unit's alone would cost a correct citation its verdict
 * for no defect removed. That is where this rule and the reference-group one part company, and the two are
 * otherwise independent with neither subsuming the other — this one is about the SHAPE of the claim,
 * that one about the PROVENANCE of the record, and it demotes in both modes because recited prose is
 * unverifiable by either tier.
 *
 * <p>A citation the model put only in the structured citations array is withheld with the rest when
 * {@link #selectClaim}'s no-inline-cite fallback attributes it to a compound claim unit. That is
 * deliberate and is pinned: the statement asserts more than THAT record is responsible for too, so
 * the judge's refusal is no more informative for it, and asking instead whether the claim unit cites
 * it would send an array-only citation to the judge against the whole conjunction — the shape issue
 * #284 is about.
 *
 * <p><strong>A residual the selection creates, stated rather than closed.</strong> Where one record is
 * cited by BOTH a compound claim unit and a single-claim sentence, {@link #selectClaim}'s cosine
 * argmax decides which it is asked about — and if it lands on the compound one, the citation is
 * withheld although a claim unit that IS its own claim was a candidate. Measured: the same answer and
 * the same citation publish {@code null} with no judge pair, or {@code true} with one, depending only
 * on which candidate the record's vector is nearer. Preferring a non-compound candidate would close it
 * and was NOT taken here: {@link #selectClaim} documents that its argmax runs exactly as
 * {@link #verdictTier1} would so the chosen statement is byte-identical across modes, and restricting
 * the candidate set under entailment alone breaks that parity — a change that needs its own evidence.
 * The cost of leaving it is a verdict withheld, not a wrong one.
 *
 * <p><strong>Cost: this rule only removes work.</strong> Nothing is published for these citations, so
 * the judge is never asked and the lazy Tier-1 fallback never runs. Claim SELECTION still embeds where
 * several sentences cite one record and the cosine argmax has to choose between them — that predates
 * this rule and is unchanged by it, which is why the A/B below adds no passes rather than removing
 * them all. Measured by A/B through the 6-arg {@link #verify} over a 12-citation
 * answer with entailment on, counting the real {@link TextEmbedder} and {@link LlmProvider} calls: one
 * compound line citing all 12 drops the batch entirely (1 {@code entailsBatch} call to 0, 12 pairs to
 * 0) and adds no embedding passes; 8 sentences of which 4 are compound, covering 9 of the 12, keep the
 * batch for the rest (1 call to 1, 12 pairs to 3) and likewise add none. Tier-1-only mode is
 * unchanged and under {@code clauseScoped} nothing moves at all. Neither degraded deployment is a
 * special case either: with no Tier-1 embedder, or with the judge unavailable, a compound unit renders
 * {@code null} exactly as it does everywhere else. The gate still keys on the CONFIGURED mode rather
 * than on whether the judge answered, because conditioning on "Tier-2 reached some verdict for this
 * answer" would switch the rule off for a single-compound-sentence answer — #302's own headline case.
 *
 * <p><strong>What it gives up.</strong> Compute is not the only thing this rule removes: a compound
 * unit under entailment now has NO tier at all, so a genuinely off-topic or mis-pointed citation
 * inside the module's most common answer shape gets no signal either. That is accepted because the
 * signal it replaces did not discriminate — the judge refuses every conjunction, and cosine against a
 * conjunction is diluted for the correct record too, which is the sweep's finding that all 8 published
 * {@code false} sat on correct, active records. It is a real loss all the same, and it is stated here
 * because this is the paragraph a reader consults for what the rule costs.
 *
 * <p><strong>The two rules above and below are disjoint by construction, and the difference between
 * them is which half of the claim the record is missing.</strong> A COMPOUND unit asserts several
 * things and cites a different record for each, so no record answers for the rest of its own unit;
 * a COMPOSITE claim asserts ONE thing that two records jointly support, so the chart record is
 * missing the relationship its co-citation supplies. A compound unit never reaches the judge at
 * all, so it can carry no Tier-2 negative for the composite rule to withhold.
 * <p><strong>A COMPOSITE claim cannot be denied by entailment.</strong> A drug-safety answer's claim
 * rests on TWO records: the chart record for the co-medication or the allergen, and the module's own
 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_SAFETY_FINDING} for the RELATIONSHIP between them
 * ("Gentamicin interacts with active order lidocaine [4], a Minor problem [239]"). The composite
 * CLAIM — two records, one sentence, both cited — is what the safety few-shot in {@link LlmProvider}
 * demonstrates, so it is expected output rather than an exotic case; the few-shot writes it with a
 * pronoun, which decides whether {@link #splitEnumeration} takes the sentence apart but not whether
 * the claim is composite. No single record entails that statement, so a correct judge answers "no" for the chart half
 * BY CONSTRUCTION, and the verdict published was {@code false} — which a client renders as
 * <em>Unsupported</em>, in red, on a correct citation (issue #284, measured live on two shapes). So
 * where a chart citation's claim statement rests on module-supplied reference material, a Tier-2
 * NEGATIVE is withheld and the citation renders {@code null} ("could not verify") — the
 * distinction issue #201 was filed over.
 *
 * <p>Splitting the statement further is not the alternative, and that was measured rather than
 * assumed: an enumerating answer of this shape is ALREADY split per item by
 * {@link #splitEnumeration}, in either mode, and the minimal item still asserts the relationship,
 * because the chart record supplies the co-medication and the finding supplies the relation. The
 * composition is semantic, not syntactic, so this is not another instance of #278's wrong-sized
 * claim to be cut down further.
 *
 * <p>What the rule does and does not reach:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>The trigger set is wider than the drug-safety answer this rule was measured on</strong>
 * (issue #354). It is membership in the reference GROUP, and since that issue a third type is in it:
 * a {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_DRUG_CLASS_NOTE} is injected where the QUESTION
 * carries a curated drug-class term, resolves no substance, and the question-driven injection toggle
 * is on — which includes a plain retrospective chart question ("is she on any NSAIDs?") raising no
 * chip at all. Neither half of that is new on its own — the #143 order-driven arm already injects a
 * reference-group record on a question resolving no substance, and a plain dose question already
 * injects a {@code drug_reference} and raises no chip. What is new is the two together: a
 * reference-group record on a question that resolves no substance AND raises no chip. So a chart citation on such a
 * question now has its entailment negative withheld too, and — the note being an ordinary cited
 * record — the unanchored path below reaches every claim in that answer. The remedy is NOT to re-key
 * this on a type name, which is the #122 mistake; it is stated here so a reader of a {@code null}
 * verdict on a non-prescribing question knows what put it there. See ADR Decision 67.</li>
 * <li><strong>Only the negative.</strong> The composition guarantees the "no"; it does not guarantee
 * the "yes", so a positive verdict still verifies the citation. That is the check the demote-only
 * carve-out is deliberately NOT extended to for
 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_ACTIVE_DRUG_ORDER} — the record issue #118 injected for
 * reconciliation, kept gradable by the carve-out comment in {@link #verify} — and it is why a
 * composite citation is not simply made demote-only. And NOT because a "yes" on a genuinely composite
 * statement would be informative — by the paragraph above it cannot be, since a correct judge answers
 * "no" there by construction. It is kept because the TRIGGER is a proxy that over-fires (see the cost
 * paragraph below), and on the shapes it is wrong about a "yes" is a real verification.</li>
 * <li><strong>Only where a judge spoke.</strong> With no Tier-2 verdict there is nothing guaranteed
 * to withhold, so Tier-1-only mode is unchanged — including its off-topic {@code false}. Deliberate:
 * every measurement on #284 was taken with entailment enabled, and no claim is made here about what a
 * cosine floor does to a composite statement. The other two ways a judge reaches no verdict are not
 * modes but per-answer accidents, and they leave the defect standing where they happen: a composite
 * claim past
 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#GROUNDING_ENTAILMENT_MAX_CHECKS}, or one whose engine call failed,
 * falls to Tier-1 and can publish {@code false} — so two citations of ONE composite sentence can
 * publish differently depending on where the cap fell between them.</li>
 * <li><strong>Not decided by the model's punctuation.</strong> Either side of the pairing can be
 * cited in the structured array with no inline marker; #284 measured the chart side that way and the
 * reference side is the same shape reversed. So a chart citation nothing anchors has its statement —
 * and what that statement rests on — read out of the whole answer, and an UNANCHORED reference
 * citation counts toward every claim, because it was offered in support of the answer without saying
 * where. See {@link AnswerCitations}. One subclass is exempt since issue #305: a citation the MODULE
 * attached is anchored by nothing and has no statement selected for it AT ALL, claim selection being
 * skipped for it.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The cost, stated rather than implied: a chart citation the model attached to the WRONG record
 * now renders unverified instead of unsupported wherever its graded statement rests on reference
 * material, so the mis-attribution signal #122 deliberately kept for reference citations has no
 * counterpart here AS A VERDICT — and since issue #377 there is a counterpart of another kind, which
 * this paragraph goes on to scope: {@link ActiveOrderCitationFidelityCheck} covers part of what
 * follows, deterministically and outside grounding entirely. Issue #377's body points a maintainer
 * at this sentence as the sole record of the residue, so read the scoping below before concluding
 * from it that nothing looks. Read "its graded statement", not "its sentence", and not "a safety sentence" —
 * both are wider than they look. An enumeration ITEM is graded on its own text but rests on its
 * parent sentence's citations, so one item citing a finding withholds every sibling item's negative;
 * and an UNANCHORED finding rests on the whole answer, so it withholds the negative of every chart
 * citation in it, including ones in sentences about something else entirely. Both follow from the
 * proxy this rule uses — see the last bullet above — and neither is separable from the cases it was
 * written for: the same syntactic shape carries the gentamicin claim, which must be withheld, and a
 * recorded-allergy list beside a finding, which need not be. The alternative —
 * falling back to Tier-1 after withholding — was rejected because it makes the fix a function of
 * {@code chartsearchai.grounding.minCosine}, which this module's own global-property text says to
 * raise to ~0.82 on an e5 querystore deployment: at that floor a composite statement — carrying the
 * other record's words as well as its own — is PREDICTED to fall below it and re-publish
 * {@code false}, returning #284 for any operator who followed the advice. Predicted and not measured,
 * because under entailment a single-candidate claim defers Tier-1 entirely, so no cosine was computed
 * for #284's cells at any floor. PART of this answer class is now checked deterministically, and
 * only part: {@link ActiveOrderCitationFidelityCheck} (issue #377) asks, of a sentence stating this
 * module's own {@code DrugSafetyValidator.ACTIVE_ORDER_INTERACTION_PHRASE}, whether the chart
 * citations offered for it can be the order at all — a condition, a visit and an encounter cannot,
 * and those were the three the ticket measured. It is a test of what a record CAN be, so a citation
 * of the WRONG in-force drug order still passes it, and it ACCUSES nothing unless the answer
 * reproduces that phrase and puts its markers directly after it. Since issue #379 that check answers
 * a second question on the same walk, published as {@code activeOrderClaims} — how many such claims
 * the answer made and how many offered no chart record — and THAT half is exactly what a claim
 * whose markers do not directly follow it produces, so the sentence above is about the accusation
 * and not about the check. Everything else this paragraph
 * describes is untouched: an enumeration ITEM resting on a sibling's finding, an UNANCHORED finding
 * withholding every chart citation in the answer, and any composite sentence whose claim is not an
 * active-order one. The {@code DrugSafetyValidator} chips are still not it — this javadoc named them
 * until #337 and they carry the deterministic text as an independent list nothing reconciles against
 * the answer — and neither are the checks that compare what the answer states about the REFERENCE
 * records it cites, which this class's own javadoc enumerates. {@code README.md} and
 * ADR Decision 41 say the same of it; an earlier draft of an earlier correction pasted the
 * reference-content sentence here and made the three disagree.
 *
 * <p>The verifier never throws into the search path: any failure (embedding
 * error, missing text) degrades to a {@code null} verdict — "could not verify"
 * — which renders as unverified, exactly as if grounding were disabled.

	 * is today's behaviour and visible; too loose publishes a wrong verdict silently. So when in doubt
	 * this refuses to split.

	 *
	 * <p><strong>Family and relative terms were measured and REJECTED — do not re-propose them.</strong>
	 * They look obviously right, because the family-history flip is the canonical case Tier-2 exists for
	 * and a verbless clause like "mother with asthma [1] and diabetes [2]" really does slip through this
	 * net, costing item 2 the qualifier. Adding {@code mother|father|sibling|child|family|maternal…}
	 * refused <strong>13</strong> real names across the two corpora: 6 on {@code child} alone
	 * ({@code Child Aspirin}, {@code Aspirin Child Chewable}, {@code Well child visit, newborn},
	 * {@code pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine (child)} …), and the rest on names such as
	 * {@code Family history of hypertension}, {@code Sibling rivalry disorder} and {@code Malaria in
	 * mother complicating pregnancy}. That is not merely a cost — it is aimed at the wrong position. An
	 * item that CARRIES a family qualifier is safe to split, because its own claim keeps it; the danger
	 * is a LATER item that lacks one. So the terms refuse exactly the lists they were meant to protect
	 * and leave the case they were meant to catch, whose item-1 text they cannot be keyed on without
	 * knowing which position it occupies. The verbless-clause residual is therefore accepted and stated
	 * rather than papered over.
	 *
	 * <p>With {@code i} and {@code patient} dropped, <strong>0</strong> of either corpus matches (93 and
	 * 24 refusals respectively, all by length). The earlier form of this comment — asserting that no
	 * drug, condition or allergen name carries a member as a whole token — was an over-claim twice
	 * over: it covered three name kinds while only drugs had been swept, and it was false for the kind
	 * that had been. Re-run BOTH sweeps before adding a member; short words are exactly what chemistry
	 * and clinical phrasing reuse. Residual errors are refusals ({@code IT band syndrome} matches
	 * {@code it}), which cost a mis-scoped citation rather than a wrong verdict.

	 * Splits a sentence that ENUMERATES its cited records into one claim per record — the shared
	 * preamble plus that record's OWN item — or returns {@code null} when the sentence is not an
	 * enumeration and must be left to the caller's normal scoping.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>Why this exists.</strong> Both scoping modes ask the wrong-sized question of an
	 * enumeration (issue #278). Sentence-scope hands every citation the whole sentence, so each
	 * allergy record is asked to entail a conjunction naming the OTHER allergens too; clause-scope
	 * hands citation <em>k</em> the cumulative prefix, which still names items 1..<em>k</em>−1. Only
	 * the first citation is ever asked about its own claim, and a correct judge answers "no" to
	 * every other one — measured live as {@code grounded=false} on all three citations of a correct,
	 * fully-cited allergy list, which a client renders as <em>Unsupported</em>.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>Why it is keyed on a colon.</strong> The claim for one item is "preamble + that
	 * item", and the preamble is the text the items hang off — so the split needs the boundary
	 * between the preamble and the FIRST item. That boundary is not recoverable in general: in
	 * "Has diabetes [1] and hypertension [2]" the preamble could be "Has" or "Has diabetes", and
	 * guessing it short strips the subject, which is the one thing the cumulative prefix exists to
	 * retain (a subject-stripped fragment cannot catch the family-history / negation flips Tier-2 is
	 * for). A list-introducing colon is the sentence declaring that boundary itself, so it is taken
	 * as the only reliable signal rather than as a convenience. Consequence, stated rather than
	 * hidden: a comma-only enumeration ("The patient has diabetes [1], hypertension [2]") is NOT
	 * split and remains mis-scoped. Narrow and correct beats broad and
	 * subject-stripping, because this decides whether a TRUE citation is published as unsupported.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>What that consequence costs is no longer a wrong verdict (issue #302).</strong> An
	 * unsplit sentence of this shape is a COMPOUND claim unit, so under entailment its citations
	 * publish no verdict — see {@link Sentence#compoundClaim()} and this class's javadoc. They stay mis-scoped, which is
	 * what the boundary problem above makes unavoidable here, but the module no longer publishes the
	 * conjunction's refusal as each citation's own verdict.
	 *
	 * <p>Returns {@code null} — meaning "not an enumeration" — for a single-citation sentence, for a
	 * sentence with no colon before its first marker, for one where any item contributes no text of its
	 * OWN beyond its marker, and for one where any item is longer than
	 * {@link #MAX_ENUMERATION_ITEM_WORDS} words or matches {@link #CLAUSE_MARKER} (either means the
	 * item is a clause, so the colon is a lead-in rather than a list header and the preamble is not the
	 * subject — see those two constants, which are independent nets over size and grammar). That last guard is why it tests the MARKER-STRIPPED item: the
	 * substring always ends in {@code [N]}, whose characters {@link #LEADING_ITEM_SEPARATOR} cannot
	 * consume, so an emptiness check on the raw item is unreachable. A colon followed immediately by
	 * a citation ("allergies: [1], Ketoconazole [2]") is not a list of NAMED items, so reading it as
	 * one is a misread — falling back beats handing that citation a preamble-only claim that asserts
	 * nothing.
	 * Each returned item is flagged {@link Sentence#isolate}: the items share a preamble, so
	 * co-batching them would let the not-per-pair-independent LLM couple their verdicts.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>That isolation has a measured cost, and it is paid deliberately.</strong> N items
	 * become N single-pair Tier-2 calls where the whole sentence was one batched call. Measured
	 * 2026-08-18 on the streaming endpoint of a local 3.7.1 standalone (gemma-4-E4B-it-Q4_K_M, same
	 * patient and session, from the {@code [timing] searchStreaming groundMs} field): a three-item
	 * enumeration grounded in 2387 ms against 1335 ms for a one-pair batched answer, so roughly half a
	 * second per additional citation. The existing
	 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#GROUNDING_ENTAILMENT_MAX_CHECKS} cap bounds the worst case. Do not
	 * "optimise" this back into the shared batch: coupled verdicts flip a correct citation to
	 * not-grounded SILENTLY, which is the failure class this method exists to remove, and a slower
	 * honest verdict beats a fast wrong one. Note what is NOT claimed — no before/after of the same
	 * question was measured, because the comparison above is between two shapes within one build.

	 * full preceding claim, not a subject-stripped fragment. A leading {@code [N]} with no text
	 * before it yields an empty clause, which grounds conservatively (not-grounded) rather than
