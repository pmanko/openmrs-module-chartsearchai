/**
 * Reports what an answer does to a class code it was handed — a deterministic, exact check for the
 * failures the semantic grounding pass is structurally unable to see. Three of them: a code no
 * record the answer CITES contains (issue #142), and, since issue #338, a code stated more than
 * once inside one parenthetical and a citation marker placed inside one.
 *
 * <p><b>The failure.</b> Measured live: the deterministic chip said class {@code J01MA}
 * (fluoroquinolones) while the answer, citing that finding's record number, said {@code J01CA}
 * (penicillins). The chip is right, the record is right, the citation is right, and the sentence a
 * clinician reads is wrong. Six further captures on #142 show the model treating a code as editable
 * text rather than as an identifier: a character mutated ({@code V03AB}→{@code V03AV},
 * {@code S01BC}→{@code S01SC}), a code invented beside the true one
 * ({@code (H02AB)}→{@code (H02AB, S01BA02)}), granularity changed in both directions
 * ({@code (A02BC)}→{@code (A02B)}, {@code (D01AC)}→{@code (D01AC07, G01AF08)}), and a correct code
 * duplicated ({@code (A01AD) (A01AD)}).
 *
 * <p><b>What the MEMBERSHIP comparison cannot see, and what issue #338 added beside it.</b> A
 * duplicated correct code is textually supported by its record, and so is any code the answer
 * OMITS — that comparison reads what the answer states, never what it fails to state. The reason
 * recorded here used to be that detecting either needs a comparison against the chips the answer
 * was expected to report; that is still true of an OMISSION (and is why one is not attempted — a
 * chip the model deliberately did not repeat is not an error), and it was measured wrong for one
 * shape of the duplication. {@link #reportMalformedParentheticals} detects a code repeated inside
 * ONE parenthetical answer-locally, reading no chip and no record: nothing this module renders
 * states one code twice inside one parenthetical, so the SHAPE is wrong on its own terms whatever
 * the records state. What stays undetected is the cross-parenthetical duplication of #142's own capture
 * ({@code (A01AD) (A01AD)}), which two clauses about two partners legitimately produce.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the existing passes cannot catch it.</b> For the citation #142 was measured on — an
 * injected {@code safety_finding} — {@link CitationGroundingVerifier}'s Tier-2 entailment never runs
 * at all: reference-group citations are demote-only and skip it (issue #106/#122), so the only pass
 * that sees them is Tier-1 cosine over the record's text, which a two-character edit inside an
 * alphanumeric token moves almost not at all. Where Tier-2 does run — a cited CHART record — it is
 * paraphrase-tolerant, which is exactly the wrong tolerance for a code substitution. Index
 * validation passes either way, because the citation really does point at the record. So this check
 * is not more grounding: it is an exact token comparison, which is the only thing that separates
 * {@code J01CA} from {@code J01MA}.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does and does not do.</b> It reports; it never rewrites, and alone among the
 * post-answer checks it states nothing on the wire — issue #337's two later rounds published their
 * answers and left this one where Decision 35 point 4 put it, deliberately rather than by oversight;
 * ADR Decision 74 says why. Editing a
 * clinician-facing sentence to remove a token is a larger decision than this check is licensed to
 * make, and a silent edit would be worse than a visible flag. The verdict reaches maintainers as a
 * WARN carrying the code the answer states, the records it cites and the codes those records
 * state, so the miscopy can be reconstructed from logs alone. Whether it should also reach the
 * clinician — a chip, or a demoted citation — is deliberately left open on #142: every surfacing
 * option is a wire or UI change, and since issue #201 a reference-group citation publishes no
 * verdict at all.
 *
 * <p><b>Where it runs.</b> Both answer paths — {@link LlmInferenceService#search} and
 * {@code searchStreaming} — so the endpoint users actually hit is covered. Deliberately NOT the
 * progressive-reasoning preview: that pass discards its answer, streams only reasoning from a
 * focused top-K chart, and resolves no citations at all, so every code in it would be reported and
 * the signal would be noise within a day. A cached answer ({@code ChartSearchServiceRouter}) is not
 * re-checked either — it was checked when it was produced. Nor is the model's REASONING, which the
 * streaming endpoint surfaces as its own {@code thinking} event: reasoning cites nothing, so every
 * code in it would be reported. That is a real gap in what a clinician can read, and a narrower
 * rule than this one would be needed to close it.
 *
 * <p><b>Conservative by construction</b>, because a check that cries wolf is worse than no check:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>it says nothing at all unless a record the answer CITES states a class code. With nothing
 *       to copy there is no copy to be unfaithful to, and this is what keeps ordinary prose out of
 *       the check: an answer about dosing frequencies cites drug-order records, which carry no
 *       codes;</li>
 *   <li>it compares WHOLE tokens, in both directions — a code the record does not state as a token
 *       is unsupported even when it is a prefix of one that it does ({@code A02B} against
 *       {@code A02BC}), and a code stated beside the true one is still unsupported;</li>
 *   <li>and it does NOT accept a level-4 class rolled up from a cited level-5 code, though that
 *       roll-up is the module's own ({@code DrugReference.atcSubgroups}) and an answer making it is
 *       usually right. It was written, then removed: pooling support across cited records, the
 *       roll-up silences #142's own headline capture whenever the chart cites a reference record
 *       for a drug in the WRONGLY named class — a patient on ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin, records
 *       stating {@code J01MA} and {@code J01CA04}, and "same ATC class (J01CA)" becomes supported.
 *       Reporting an answer that generalises correctly costs a log line a maintainer dismisses;
 *       failing to report the fabrication this check exists for costs the check its purpose;</li>
 *   <li>it abstains for the whole answer — not per citation, as the grounding verifier does — when
 *       any cited record carries no readable text, since a record we could not read may be the one
 *       that states the code. That is the same "cannot verify" treatment
 *       {@link CitationGroundingVerifier} gives a null/blank record text, applied at a coarser
 *       grain because one unread record is enough to make the whole comparison unsound;</li>
 *   <li>it matches only upper-case tokens whose first letter is one of ATC's fourteen main groups,
 *       so no lower-case word and no {@code Q12H}-shaped frequency can be mistaken for a code. One
 *       pattern reads both sides, so that cuts both ways: a lower-cased code in an answer is a
 *       silent pass, and a lower-cased code in a chart NOTE supports nothing. Both are accepted —
 *       every code this module renders is upper-cased ({@code DrugReference.normalizeAtcToken}),
 *       and case-folding one side would make the two sides disagree about what a code is.</li>
 * </ul>

	 * A closed set at the top of the classification, unlike the level-2 groups beneath it, which the

	 *
	 * <p>It is what keeps the commonest clinical shapes out of the check: {@code Q12H},

	 *
	 * <p><b>Both are answer-LOCAL in the sense that matters here.</b> Neither asks what the records
	 * STATE — they ask what SHAPE the prose has, and the shape is wrong on its own terms. (The marker
	 * rule does ask the records one thing: whether an index resolves to one, which is what keeps a
	 * number the chart has no record for out of it.) That is what keeps them clear of the
	 * comparison ADR Decision 35 rejects (the answer's codes against the CHIPS, i.e. against what the
	 * answer was expected to report rather than what it was licensed to state): nothing here reads a
	 * chip, and nothing here reads what the answer failed to say.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The repetition rule is a shape claim and not a licensing one</b>, and saying so is the
	 * point. On #338's capture four cited findings each state {@code H02AB}, so the four occurrences
	 * of it in {@code (H02AB, H02AB, H02AB, H02AB)} are supported both as a set and as a multiset;
	 * a membership test of any strength calls that answer faithful. What no record licenses is the
	 * FORM. It is a LIST that has a source and a REPETITION that has none: the injected
	 * drug-reference record renders a substance's own codes as a round-parenthesised list, so two
	 * DIFFERENT codes in one parenthetical are deliberately left alone — but it builds that list from
	 * {@code DrugReference.normalizedAtcCodes()}, which returns a {@code Set}, and the chip's class
	 * sentence renders one subgroup. Several renderers parenthesise dataset- or operator-authored
	 * FREE TEXT beside a code — a drug class, an interaction note, a severity, a cross-reactivity
	 * group name, a generic name — so the guarantee is about the data rather than about the code, and
	 * it is stated as a measurement rather than as a list of renderers that would go stale.
	 *
	 * <p>Measured over all three shipped reference files, by driving the real parsers and this
	 * class's own {@link #classCodesIn}: over the knowledge base's 2283 entries and their 590,312
	 * interactions, counting one field at a time — drug class, generic name and display label per
	 * entry, note and severity per interaction, note and token per contraindication, 1,187,473
	 * fields in all — ZERO state an ATC-shaped token. State the base as well as the count: the
	 * contraindication clause contributes none of those fields, the shipped KB parsing to zero
	 * contraindications. The curated file's 4 rows carry a drug class stating none, and the one
	 * shipped cross-reactivity group is named {@code NSAID}. So no shipped data can put a code
	 * inside a parenthetical twice. An operator file that states one in any of those fields can,
	 * and an answer quoting that record faithfully is then reported.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Every parenthetical is read AT ITS OWN LEVEL</b> ({@link #parentheticalsAtTheirOwnLevel}),
	 * over a bracket walk rather than a regex: a nested group's codes and markers are that group's,
	 * not its parent's. Both rules are then about one pair of brackets, which is what they say. An
	 * unmatched {@code (} opens nothing — it neither pools a paragraph into one "parenthetical" nor
	 * silences the groups after it — and an unmatched {@code )} closes nothing. That walk's javadoc
	 * carries what the two rejected readings cost, both of which shipped in review.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It reports; it never rewrites</b>, for the reason the membership report gives and not for
	 * a new one: editing a clinician-facing sentence is a larger decision than this check is licensed
	 * to make, and a silent edit is worse than a visible flag (ADR Decision 35, point 4). It is NOT
	 * because the streaming path has already handed the answer out — {@code normalizeSlashCitations}
	 * already ships a repair that applies to the final answer only, with the client contract that
	 * makes it safe, so streaming forces nothing here.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What the false-alarm rate is, is unmeasured.</b> ADR Decision 35's own gates were
	 * justified by driving {@link #classCodesIn} over 340 live captured answers; that corpus is
	 * outside this repository and the fixture tree inside it is structurally blind to these rules —
	 * measured here by driving {@link #classCodesIn} itself over that tree (72 json files, 42 captured

	/**
	 * @return the text of every {@code (...)} group in {@code text} AT ITS OWN LEVEL — the content
	 *         between its brackets with each nested group's own span REPLACED BY A SPACE, since that
	 *         span is its own entry — in opening order, one entry per matched {@code (}. An unmatched
	 *         {@code (} opens nothing and an unmatched {@code )} closes nothing. Empty for null text.
	 *         A space and not nothing: the replacement is a separator, or the text either side of a
	 *         nested span is welded into one run and both rules read TOKENS off the result.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Own level, and both halves of that were wrong once.</b> Reading only the
	 *         OUTERMOST group emitted nothing at all while an unclosed {@code (} was open, so one
	 *         stray bracket made both rules blind to the whole remainder of an answer — silently,
	 *         fail-open, on exactly the malformed prose they are about. Reading every group's WHOLE
	 *         text instead put a child's codes and markers into its parent as well, so two clauses
	 *         wrapped in one aside ({@code (levofloxacin (J01MA) and moxifloxacin (J01MA))}) reported
	 *         a repetition, and a marker correctly placed after an inner clause
	 *         ({@code (ATC class (J01MA) [3])}) reported a misplacement — both correct prose, and the
	 *         cries-wolf direction this check must not fail in. Pairing the brackets first and then
	 *         reading each group at its own level is what answers all three, and it is linear: every
	 *         character belongs to exactly one level, and an ancestor steps over a nested span in one
	 *         jump. The whole-text form was measured quadratic — seconds of blocking-path CPU and a
	 *         multi-megabyte WARN line on a deeply bracketed answer.
