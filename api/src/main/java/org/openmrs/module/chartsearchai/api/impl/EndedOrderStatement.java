/**
 * The module's own statement that the chart records a drug only as an order no longer in force, for
 * an answer that did not say so — issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/472">#472</a>, ADR Decision
 * 110.
 *
 * <p><b>The gap this closes.</b> Decision 110's A/B recorded the shipped prompt answering <em>"Her
 * current medications are lamivudine, nevirapine and rifampicin. Any interactions?"</em> with <em>"Yes,
 * there are interactions recorded for these medications."</em>: the refusal gone, the clinician's false
 * premise still confirmed, and the only trace of the referent a chip key no client renders yet. The
 * module holds that fact structurally — {@link SafetyWarning#isAboutAnEndedOrder()} and
 * {@link SafetyWarning#getEndedOrderStopDate()}, written where the validator decided them — so it
 * states it the way ADR Decision 100's {@code FindingPartnerCoverageCheck} states an order the prose
 * left unnamed: appended by the module, with no model asked and no prompt changed.
 *
 * <p><b>What "the answer said so" is</b>: some sentence of the answer
 * ({@code ChartSearchAiUtils.SENTENCE_BOUNDARY}) contains {@link #NO_LONGER_IN_FORCE}, the words the
 * prompt's ended-order branch tells the model to use, ABOUT the chip's drug — the drug named nearest
 * before that occurrence, by position, or a combination name joining this drug to it, or, where no drug
 * is named before it, the drug named nearest after it (issue #489)
 * ({@link DrugSafetyValidator#isAboutTheEndedOrderDrug}, over the loaded dataset). So <em>"Rifampicin
 * interacts with nevirapine; her isoniazid order is no longer in force."</em> does not state rifampicin's
 * end, and neither does the same sentence with "and" in place of the semicolon (issue #482): until then
 * one sentence naming the drug anywhere and carrying the phrase anywhere was read as saying it. ADR
 * Decision 47's recorded live wording, <em>"Nevirapine was prescribed, but its order is no longer in
 * force"</em>, names no other drug before the phrase and still states it. The drug is asked by
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#namesTheEndedOrderDrug}'s rows — the prose rule over every row of its
 * substance, so "rifampicin" or "rifampin" names a chip labelled {@code Rifampicin (rifampin)} — and
 * never as a substring of that label, which no answer writes (PR #478, review round 2). The phrase is
 * containment, so a paraphrase ("it was discontinued") reads as unstated and the sentence is appended
 * beside it — the residue runs toward saying it twice rather than toward silence, the direction
 * Decision 100 chose for the same reason. What this reading still gets wrong, in each direction, is ADR
 * Decision 110's first residue.

	 * {@code Rifampicin (rifampin)} the sentence names both. It carries no citation marker — it
	 * offers no evidence the chips do not, and a marker would claim a record this text did not read —
	 * and it states the date only where the chip carries one. It states what the chart RECORDS, never
	 * that the drug may or may not be given: that is the finding's call, and the prompt's.
