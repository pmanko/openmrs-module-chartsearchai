/**
 * Whether the answer stated every active order the findings it CITED name.
 *
 * <p><b>The gap this closes.</b> ADR Decision 99 collapsed one mechanism onto one chip naming every
 * order it covers, and moved a shortfall with it: before, a finding the answer left out went uncited
 * and {@code findingCitations} counted it; after, the finding is cited and a NAME inside it can go
 * unstated, which that key cannot see because it counts findings. Measured live on the 3.7.1
 * standalone (patient Sarah Taylor, 2026-09-15, two consecutive runs): the chip named
 * Methylprednisolone, Prednisone, Budesonide, Dexamethasone and Hydrocortisone; the answer named four
 * of them, dropping Dexamethasone, while every published key read clean.
 *
 * <p><b>It reads the names structurally</b> — {@code RecordMapping.getFindingPartners()}, the injected
 * finding's own copy of {@link SafetyWarning#namedPartners()}, written where the record is — and never
 * by parsing the detail the module itself composed them into, which is the two-resolutions-that-agree
 * shape issue #151 forbids.
 *
 * <p><b>Its population is the findings the answer CITED</b> (issue #516), read through
 * {@code SafetyFindingCitationExtentCheck.citedFindingIndexes}, the only reading of which findings an
 * answer cited, and pinned to it by
 * {@code ArchitectureGuardTest.theFindingPartnerCompletionTakesItsCitedReadingFromTheExtentCheck},
 * which checks that the call is made and not what it is handed —
 * {@code CitedFindingPartnerCompletionTest.aFindingOnlyTheStructuredCitationsArrayListsHasNoOrderAppended}
 * reddens where the answer handed to it is blank, so the reading falls back to the #409 union.
 * Before that issue it was every chip the response raised, which the appended sentence then credited
 * to "those findings" — ADR Decision 100's amendment records what that put in front of a clinician.
 * A finding the answer did not cite is {@code findingCitations}' to count, and none of its
 * orders is appended — the chips beside the answer carry the orders each names as
 * {@code namedPartners}; an answer citing no finding gets nothing appended and no measurement.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does NOT establish.</b> Containment over the answer's prose is the test, so a name the
 * model spelled differently reads as unstated; the residue therefore runs toward REPORTING a shortfall
 * rather than toward silence, which is the safe direction for a diagnostic and the opposite of
 * {@code findingCitations}'s. Since issue #516 both operands are compared in {@code comparable} form,
 * which folds case and takes out the whitespace around a slash — the difference that issue measured
 * putting a false "not named above" into an answer. Since issue #555 a partner is also stated where the
 * prose writes the NAME of a row its chip resolved it to, by the drug-name PROSE rule — the difference
 * between the knowledge base's label a finding prints (<em>Rifampicin (rifampin)</em>) and the name an
 * answer writes (<em>Rifampicin</em>), measured putting the same false sentence into 6 of 22 answers on
 * that issue's patient. The row's name and never its other names, which include everyday words
 * ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.namesThePartner} says which). Which findings' partners carry rows is
 * {@link #statedPartners}'; every other spelling difference reads as unstated. Containment has a residue
 * in the other direction too: an order whose name sits inside a longer one the answer wrote
 * ({@code Lamivudine} inside {@code Lamivudine / zidovudine}) reads as stated, and so, through the #555
 * credit, does a partner whose row's name is itself an everyday word, and a condition-mediated partner
 * resolved to several substances, by the name of any of them. It says nothing about whether the answer's claim ABOUT a partner is right — that is {@code ReferenceProseFidelityCheck}'s question — only whether the
 * partner was named at all. An ordinary finding names one order and is measured like the rest, while
 * the merged finding and, since issue #477, the finding that a drug is already in several of her
 * orders and the finding that several of her orders share a substance are where a list can be
 * under-stated in part.
