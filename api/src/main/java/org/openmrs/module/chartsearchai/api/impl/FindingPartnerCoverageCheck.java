/**
 * Whether the answer stated every active order a MERGED finding names.
 *
 * <p><b>The gap this closes.</b> ADR Decision 99 collapsed one mechanism onto one chip naming every
 * order it covers, and moved a shortfall with it: before, a finding the answer left out went uncited
 * and {@code findingCitations} counted it; after, the finding is cited and a NAME inside it can go
 * unstated, which that key cannot see because it counts findings. Measured live on the 3.7.1
 * standalone (patient Sarah Taylor, 2026-09-15, two consecutive runs): the chip named
 * Methylprednisolone, Prednisone, Budesonide, Dexamethasone and Hydrocortisone; the answer named four
 * of them, dropping Dexamethasone, while every published key read clean.
 *
 * <p><b>It reads the names structurally</b> — {@link SafetyWarning#namedPartners()}, written where the
 * merge decided them — and never by parsing the detail the module itself composed them into, which is
 * the two-resolutions-that-agree shape issue #151 forbids.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does NOT establish.</b> Containment over the answer's prose is the test, so a name the
 * model spelled differently reads as unstated; the residue therefore runs toward REPORTING a shortfall
 * rather than toward silence, which is the safe direction for a diagnostic and the opposite of
 * {@code findingCitations}'s. It says nothing about whether the answer's claim ABOUT a partner is
 * right — that is {@code ReferenceProseFidelityCheck}'s question — only whether the partner was named
 * at all. And it is scoped to merged chips: an ordinary chip names one partner and has no list to
 * under-state, so it is outside the population rather than passing it.
