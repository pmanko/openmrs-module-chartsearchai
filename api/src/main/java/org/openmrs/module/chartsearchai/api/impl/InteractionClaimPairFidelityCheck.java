/**
 * Reports an <em>"X interacts with active order Y"</em> claim whose pair no finding of the module's
 * relates — issue <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/514">#514</a>.
 * A deterministic, exact comparison like its siblings: no model call, no embedding.
 *
 * <p><b>The failure.</b> On the external DDI evaluation's demo patients (chartsearchai {@code main}
 * @ {@code 627449a7}, Gemma 4 E2B, each byte-identical across two runs), a question listing her
 * medications before asking about a new drug put findings about several subjects in the prompt, and
 * the answer gave one drug's finding to another — <em>"Metformin interacts with active order
 * Lamivudine / zidovudine … [353]"</em>, [353] being Stavudine's finding — or stated a Metformin pair
 * no finding raised, citing nothing. {@code misattributedOrderCitations},
 * {@code unfaithfullyRenderedCitations} and {@code unstatedFindingSeverities} read {@code []} or
 * flagged something else.
 *
 * <p><b>The unit is {@link ActiveOrderCitationFidelityCheck#claims}'s</b>: an occurrence of
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.ACTIVE_ORDER_NOUN}, the words before it in its clause as the SUBJECT — from
 * past a lead's colon or spaced dash ({@link #afterItsLead}), and no further back than the end of the
 * previous claim's partner span or run —
 * the words after it up to its marker run (or clause bound) as the PARTNER, and that run as what it
 * cites. One walk, so this check and that one cannot disagree about which claims the answer made or
 * which markers each offered. A marker past the claim's comma is not in its run — the ticket's cases
 * 2 and 4 put it there — and is never taken for the claim, which is judged as citing nothing. Taken on
 * gates reading the words before it, it accused a later clause's own correct citation, the report ADR
 * Decision 76 calls crying wolf, where that clause named its drug by a word no finding prints in a verb
 * other than the phrase's (<em>"…, and the other statin does too [6]"</em>, round 2 of #514's third
 * review). A finding it would have taken that relates the pair is in the population an uncited claim is
 * judged against, so such a claim is reported only where no finding relates its pair — as unfounded.
 *
 * <p><b>What a finding relates is read structurally, never from its text.</b> Every name a finding
 * goes by: its subject ({@link ChartSearchAiUtils#findingSubject} on a record,
 * {@link SafetyWarning#getDrug()} on a chip), the orders it names
 * ({@link RecordMapping#getFindingPartners()}, {@link SafetyWarning#namedPartners()}), and the names
 * its drugs go by through her orders ({@link RecordMapping#getFindingBridgeNames()},
 * {@link SafetyWarning#orderNamesOf}) — the prescriptions and substances its chart-order clause
 * resolved them from, because a brand-named order's finding gives the drug a second name the model may
 * use (#349), and the display of every order its arm matched a drug against, because a finding names
 * its partner by the knowledge base's label (<em>Rifampicin (rifampin)</em>) while the chart's record of
 * the order prints its display (<em>Rifampicin 300mg capsule</em>), and the finding states no
 * chart-order clause where that display names the substance (round 4 of #514's review) — and beside
 * each display the label of every substance that order resolves, for the mirror: a finding naming its
 * partner by the order's display (<em>Isoniazid / pyrazinamide / rifampin</em>) while the prompt's
 * findings about rifampicin print <em>Rifampicin (rifampin)</em> (round 4 of the fourth review).
 * A finding relates a subject to a partner when each names one of those names, whichever way round: an
 * interaction relates two drugs whichever the sentence leads with, the screening arm's two drugs are
 * both her orders, and issue #477's findings relate two of her orders to each other. So two orders one
 * finding names read as related, and a claim pairing two orders of a merged finding is not reported —
 * {@link #anyRelates} says why that is the direction chosen.
 *
 * <p><b>A partner is judged only where its span STARTS with a name the findings carry</b> — the owner's
 * decision on #514 after round 6 of its review, where <em>"… active order Rifampicin — Moderate
 * [4]"</em>, compared whole, accused its own finding. A known name is one of the findings' and chips'
 * names above; the span must begin, on a word's boundary, with the start of one or of one of its parts
 * ({@link #beginsAPartOf}), and whatever follows is ignored — a strength, a form, a severity, a full
 * stop ({@link #nameAt}). A span starting otherwise — a brand or paraphrase no finding prints, a word
 * before the name, a drug no finding or chip names — is left UNJUDGED, never compared whole. Only a
 * false report blocks this check; a missed one is a residue of ADR Decision 120.
 *
 * <p><b>A claim can state several pairs</b> (round 2 of #514's review). Every further drug the partner
 * span names that a finding or chip names is a PARTNER of it — <em>"active order Amiodarone and
 * Digoxin"</em> states two ({@link #partnersNamed}). Every such drug the SUBJECT span
 * names is a READING of its subject, and the claim is judged only where every reading reaches one
 * verdict: which drug of <em>"X can be given alongside Y but X interacts with…"</em> is the subject is
 * the one nearest the noun, and of <em>"…alongside Y but it interacts with…"</em> is not, the same
 * readings in the same positions — so taking any reading that relates passes a swap, and taking the
 * nearest accuses a correct citation.
 *
 * <p><b>Two answers.</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A claim whose run cites findings, none of which relates its
 *       subject to any of its partners: every one of them is MISATTRIBUTED. A run citing one that
 *       relates and one that does not is silent.</li>
 *   <li>A claim citing no finding, or citing one that relates another of its partners, where a partner
 *       is related to its subject by no finding in the prompt and no chip beside the answer: UNFOUNDED —
 *       the invented partner, alone or beside a real one. The chips count because a drug only the answer
 *       names is put in play after the answer, and a pair the module did raise is not one "no finding
 *       raised".</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Conservative by construction</b>, since a check that cries wolf is worse than none — each of
 * these makes a claim UNJUDGED, outside all three published numbers:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the subject side names no drug any interaction or condition-mediated finding or chip names —
 *       a pronoun, a brand the findings do not carry, a misspelling. A side names a name by
 *       containment in
 *       {@link FindingPartnerCoverageCheck#comparable} form, the form that class compares an order's
 *       printed name in, so one comparison serves both. That class also credits an order the prose names
 *       by the rows its finding's chip resolved it to (issue #555); this check does not ask that;</li>
 *   <li>the partner span is blank, or does not start with a known name;</li>
 *   <li>the subject clause carries a word standing for a drug without naming it —
 *       {@link #SUBJECT_STAND_INS}, <em>it</em>, <em>this</em>, <em>which</em>, the <em>the</em> of
 *       <em>"the drug"</em> — since its subject may then be a drug named before its comma or in the
 *       sentence before, and the drug the clause does name is the wrong reading: <em>"Clarithromycin can
 *       be given, but together with Simvastatin it interacts with active order Amiodarone"</em> (round 3
 *       of #514's review);</li>
 *   <li>the subject clause carries a word denying what it states — {@link #NEGATORS}: <em>"Simvastatin
 *       does not interact with active order Digoxin"</em> names a pair it denies (round 1 of #514's
 *       second review);</li>
 *   <li>the subject span does not END in a drug it names followed straight by the phrase's own verb
 *       ({@link #statesTheVerbOfItsDrug}) — <em>"is unlikely to interact with"</em> or <em>"rarely
 *       interacts with"</em> may not assert the pair it names (round 2 of #514's third review);</li>
 *   <li>that drug does not OPEN its clause ({@link #opensItsClause}) — a word stands straight before
 *       it other than a lone <em>and</em> or a <em>but</em> after no denial, so its subject may be a
 *       drug before a comma the clause never closed or one named by a word no finding prints:
 *       <em>"Clarithromycin, like Simvastatin interacts…"</em>, <em>"Biaxin with Simvastatin
 *       interacts…"</em> (round 3 of #514's third review) — or, citing a finding, a word stands before
 *       the comma its clause begins past and the drug has nothing but a lone <em>and</em> before it
 *       ({@link #mayShareItsSubject}), since a drug there may be a subject beside it
 *       (<em>"Clarithromycin, Simvastatin interacts…"</em>);</li>
 *   <li>the partner span names several drugs joined by words other than a list's
 *       ({@link #PARTNER_LIST_WORDS}) — <em>"active order Amiodarone but not with Digoxin"</em> ran on
 *       into a clause of its own, which may deny the second pair (round 3) — or followed by a word
 *       before any punctuation, the last of them perhaps opening a clause of its own (<em>"active order
 *       Amiodarone and Digoxin is unaffected"</em>, round 1 of the second review), where the claim read
 *       with that drug as a partner and without it reaches two verdicts ({@link #partnerReadings});</li>
 *   <li>the drugs the subject span names reach different verdicts — the claim's clause names another
 *       drug before the noun with no comma or semicolon between, as a lead clause joined by
 *       <em>but</em> or a parenthesis does;</li>
 *   <li>the run cites a reference record that is not a relating finding — a {@code drug_reference}
 *       monograph states interactions no finding raises (#357 renders a sub-floor rule naming her
 *       order in its tail), and this check reads no reference text;</li>
 *   <li>a finding naming no order — a class-only relationship, whose partner is a class — is about a
 *       drug either side names, among the findings the claim is judged against: those it cites, or
 *       where it cites none, every finding and chip. Whether it meant the claim's partner cannot be
 *       read.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Contraindication and overdose findings relate no drug to an order, so they are not in the
 * population an uncited claim is judged against — and a run citing one is the reference-record case
 * above: a finding is reference material, and one that relates no drug to an order is not a relating
 * one.
 *
 * <p><b>What it cannot see.</b> Containment reads a short name inside a longer one as the same drug —
 * <em>Lamivudine</em> inside <em>Lamivudine / zidovudine</em> — so a swap between those two passes,
 * and so does a claim naming a combination order by the label of a substance in it other than the one
 * the finding's rule is about, as it does by that substance's word in the display.
 * An invented pair whose subject or partner is a drug no finding or chip names is unjudged, and so is a
 * partner named by a brand, a paraphrase or a word inside a part of a name (<em>isoniazid</em> of a
 * combination's display) rather than the start of one. The first words of a name two drugs share read
 * as either, toward silence. A claim pairing two orders one finding names reads as
 * related, so an order put in for a merged finding's subject passes — {@link #anyRelates} says why.
 * A claim whose only marker sits past its clause names no citation, so a swap the marker carries is
 * reported only where no finding relates the claim's pair. A claim whose verb is not the phrase's own
 * straight after its drug — a hedge (<em>"may interact with"</em>), <em>"also interacts with"</em>, a
 * verbatim copy of another finding's wording — is left unjudged, as is one naming its drug by a brand
 * no finding prints. So is a claim whose drug has a word before it in its clause other than a lone
 * <em>and</em> or a <em>but</em> (<em>"Also X interacts…"</em>, an item number <em>"1)"</em>), and one
 * citing a finding after a comma a word stands before (<em>"However, X interacts… [n]"</em>, <em>"No,
 * X interacts… [n]"</em>) — a swap there is a missed report; the same claim citing nothing is judged.
 * The stand-in words and the list words are closed sets used only to refuse: a
 * clause carrying one for another reason (<em>"note that X interacts…"</em>) and a list joined by
 * other words (<em>"as well as"</em>) are left unjudged. The negators are a closed set too, and a
 * negator in an earlier clause the subject span reaches — no comma, semicolon, colon or spaced em or
 * en dash between, as in <em>"X should not be given because X interacts…"</em> or a lead ending in a
 * spaced hyphen — leaves an asserting claim unjudged. A list's last partner followed by
 * punctuation and then a clause of its own is still read as a partner.
 * A second partner no finding or chip names at all — <em>Heparin</em> in <em>"active order Amiodarone
 * and Heparin"</em> — is no name to this check, so it reads as words after the related partner and
 * passes; a partner list continued past a comma is cut at it, so <em>"active order Amiodarone, Heparin
 * and Digoxin"</em> is judged on Amiodarone alone. A swapped subject in a clause naming several drugs is
 * left unjudged, not reported — a pronoun or a parenthesis included — and so is one after a claim with no
 * marker and no comma, whose partner span runs to its noun and leaves its subject span empty. Starting that
 * span where the previous partner BEGAN reported the swap and read <em>"X interacts with active order A and
 * active order B [b]"</em> as A's claim, accusing X's own B finding (round 3 of #514's second review).
 * And a claim not written in the
 * active-order form — the ticket's first case, <em>"a caution to note regarding interactions with
 * Lopinavir / ritonavir, Didanosine, and Nevirapine [288], [290]"</em> — is not a claim to this check
 * at all. ADR Decision 120 records them.
 *
 * <p><b>It reports and it publishes</b> — the WARN for a maintainer, carrying the citations and the
 * counts and never a drug name (the names are this patient's medications, and core ships
 * {@code org.openmrs} at WARN: ADR Decision 102), and {@code ChartAnswer.getInteractionClaimPairs()}
 * for a client. It never rewrites the answer.
 *
 * <p><b>Where it runs.</b> Both answer paths, over the MODEL's prose and after the post-answer chips
 * exist; never over the module-composed answer (#469), which no model wrote, nor on the
 * async-grounding early {@code done}, which is handed off before the chips exist.
