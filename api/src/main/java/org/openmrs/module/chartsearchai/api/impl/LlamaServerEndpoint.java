/**
 * The one place that addresses and authenticates the {@code llama-server} subprocess
 * {@link LocalLlmEngine} spawns: it owns the loopback URL for every endpoint the module calls and
 * the per-server-start secret that both sides of the channel share.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it exists (issue #445).</b> The engine previously built its own {@link HttpRequest} at
 * each of five call sites and sent no credential with any of them, so the local server accepted
 * anything that could open a TCP connection to the port. A shared {@code getCompletionsUrl} helper
 * already existed, which is the point: one place for the URL is not one place for the REQUEST, and
 * it is the request that carries the credential. On the rated topology —
 * the {@code .omod} installed on an existing OpenMRS host — an unprivileged local OS user holds no
 * database or OpenMRS credential yet can reach that port, and could therefore run free inference
 * and call the {@code /slots} save/restore/erase endpoints on a patient's persisted KV cache. With
 * the addressing in five places there was nowhere authentication COULD be added once, and five
 * places to forget it. Every request to the local server is built here so that it cannot be
 * forgotten; {@code ArchitectureGuardTest.everyLocalServerRequestCarriesTheModulesKey} is what
 * keeps a sixth call site from being hand-rolled beside these.
 *
 * <p><b>The secret is handed to the child in its ENVIRONMENT, never on its command line.</b>
 * {@code llama-server} accepts the key three ways — {@code --api-key KEY}, {@code --api-key-file
 * FNAME}, and the {@code LLAMA_API_KEY} environment variable — and the command-line form is the one
 * that must not be used: an argument vector is world-readable through {@code ps}, so it would hand
 * the key to the very principal this change exists to lock out. A process's environment is not
 * exposed the same way — measured on macOS, {@code ps -E} lists the variables of a process this
 * user owns and none for a process owned by another — which is the same protection class as an
 * owner-only key file, with no file to write, restrict, or clean up on a failure path. The rated
 * topology is a Linux OpenMRS host rather than the machine that measurement was taken on; ADR
 * Decision 107 row 10 carries it with that qualifier. See {@code docs/adr.md}
 * Decision 107 for the measurement behind each of those claims.
 *
 * <p><b>A bearer token authenticates the CLIENT to the server and never the server to the
 * client.</b> Between them {@link #unauthenticatedProbeStatus} and
 * {@link #doesNotRefuseThisModulesKey} establish exactly this much: SOME credential is demanded on
 * the route the chart travels, and ours was not actively refused. That is enough to catch a build
 * that ignored the environment variable, which is what they are for. It is NOT "the listener is
 * enforcing this start's key" — a listener that refuses unauthenticated calls and serves no
 * {@code /props} passes both legs while accepting the key nowhere — and it is not "the listener is
 * the child the engine spawned", which no bearer token can establish in this direction. What ties
 * readiness to the child is {@link LocalLlmEngine#requireLoopbackPortFree} plus the liveness
 * {@link LocalLlmEngine#requireListenerMayBeServed} asks once the child's bind attempt has been
 * decided — and it is the TIMING of that question, not the asking of it, that carries the weight:
 * a child alive by then holds the port, which only one process can, so the listener that answered
 * is that child. Liveness read at the first healthy reply establishes none of that, the reply
 * arriving milliseconds after the launch and the bind 0.138 s after it (Decision 107 row 7). Do
 * not write these two probes up as peer authentication.
 *
 * <p>One instance per server start, discarded with the process it was minted for, so a secret is
 * never reused across two children.
