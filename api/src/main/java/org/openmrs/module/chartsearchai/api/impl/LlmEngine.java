	 * {@code HttpRequest.timeout()}, which stops applying once the inference server's response
	 * headers arrive; the token stream is then read lazily out of
	 * {@code BodyHandlers.ofInputStream()} and is bounded by nothing. So {@code timeoutSeconds} caps
	 * the wait for the FIRST output and not the call. Measured 2026-08-20 against a local
	 * {@code llama-server} on CPU ({@code -ngl 0}, Llama-3.2-3B-Q4_K_M): a cold prefill raised
	 * {@code HttpTimeoutException} at 2.0s and at 8.0s against timeouts of exactly those lengths,
	 * while a cache-warm request under a 20s timeout returned headers at 117ms and then streamed for
	 * 23.8s without raising one. Those figures come from a standalone client issuing the same two
	 * calls both of them make here, {@code HttpRequest.timeout(...)} and
	 * {@code send(request, BodyHandlers.ofInputStream())}, rather than from this method, which needs a
	 * running module: the model and the prompt decide only how long the prefill takes, which is what
	 * the 2.0s and 8.0s runs turn on, and neither reaches the JDK behaviour being measured. The same
	 * behaviour reproduces with no inference server at all, against a socket that sends headers and
	 * then stalls, on Java 11, 17 and 21 alike and with {@code ofString()} as well. It is also a
	 * PER-CALL budget rather than a per-invocation one: {@link LocalLlmEngine} spends it again on
	 * each KV-cache slot call the six-argument form below can make around the completion.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>The non-streaming forms, {@link #infer(String, String, int)} and
	 * {@link #warmup(String, String, int)}, keep the "maximum wall-clock seconds" wording
	 * deliberately: whether a server that does not stream withholds its headers until the answer is
	 * complete was not measured, and if it does then that wording holds there.</p>
