	 * let a filter added to one drift from the other silently, so that the prompt asks for an

	 * after the answer and needs the index SET; this runs before there is one and needs only whether
	 * there are two records, so it counts the records rather than crossing into the check to count
	 * the indexes they were numbered with.
	 *
	 * <p>The threshold is TWO because one finding is not an enumeration. Nothing published records
	 * the per-cell carried counts of the measured corpus, so no claim is made about them here.
	 *
	 * <p><b>ONE SUBJECT, and that conjunct is the clause's own precondition rather than a
	 * refinement of it.</b> The sentence reads "Where more than one finding names <em>it</em>", and
	 * its {@code it} is a drug; a chart whose findings name several drugs offers no single referent
	 * for it, so the sentence describes an arrangement that chart does not have. Measured over the
	 * bundled DDInter knowledge base through {@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.injectorWithSafety(
	 * ddinterServiceWithGroups()).injectRecords}, with the subjects read back by the same
	 * {@code findingSubjects} this method calls, on a two-order chart with six resolved active
	 * drugs: {@code "do any of her meds interact?"} —
	 * an issue #113 interaction SCREEN, which needs no drug in the question at all — injects ten
	 * findings naming FIVE subjects, and this conjunct is what keeps the clause off it. Without it
	 * the flag is true there, and no arm of #397's A/B contains such a cell. That population is also
	 * the one with a recorded measurement of citing NONE of its findings — see
	 * {@code eval/drift-metric/score_probe_safety.py}'s {@code findings_incompletely_stated}
	 * docstring, where a wh-question carried ten screening-arm findings and cited none of them.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it does NOT establish is that the QUESTION names that drug.</b> A screen whose
	 * findings happen to name one of her own drugs still takes the clause (measured: the same
	 * arrangement with four resolved drugs injects two findings naming one subject), and there the
	 * antecedent for {@code it} is in the records rather than the question. That is unmeasured and
	 * is not claimed closed; what the conjunct does guarantee is that whenever the clause is sent,
	 * exactly one drug in the prompt satisfies its own description. Narrowing on the question's
	 * phrasing instead — {@code QueryScopeRouter.isInteractionScreening} negated — was measured and
	 * is worse in both directions. {@code "Does clarithromycin interact with any of her current
	 * medications?"} carries the screening cue yet its findings name the one drug the question names,
	 * the screening arm standing down because the question resolved a drug (four resolved active
	 * drugs: four findings, one subject), so a phrasing gate withholds the clause there for no
	 * reason. {@code "Do her clarithromycin and amiodarone interact?"} carries no screening cue and
	 * names two (six resolved active drugs: nine findings, two subjects), so a phrasing gate sends
	 * it. Both figures are from the arrangement above through the same helper.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Gating at all — rather than appending the clause unconditionally — is also about the
	 * absent-data prompt.</b> The empty-chart message's exact bytes are pinned by
	 * {@code AbsentDataEvalTest.theEmptyChartPromptAsksTheModelToNameWhatIsMissing} after 19
	 * measured cases, and that test is how this method came to exist rather than by design. It
