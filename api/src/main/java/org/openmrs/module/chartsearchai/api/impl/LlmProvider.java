			// ISSUE #315, and it is a REPORTING rule rather than a CLASSIFICATION one — which is the
			// whole reason it can exist at all. ADR Decision 45 measured four CLAUSE wordings of an
			// ENDED/CURRENT clause over querystore's TEXT markers and reverted every one: an order
			// lapsed by auto_expire_date renders no end marker, so the model was being asked to sort
			// records into two classes with no discriminator for one of them — it misfiled that record
			// (four is its W1-W4; its own "five wordings" counts the clause-less control as a row. Nine
			// further wordings are counted there and TWO of them are described, so seven are unrecorded
			// — do not re-run the two it names)
			// and then asserted the lapsed drug as current in a clinical answer. #317 (Decision 46)
			// removed that gap: a drug_order record carries PatientChartSerializer's own mark wherever the
			// module could establish the answer — not everywhere, and deliberately so; see
			// SerializedRecord.getOrderActive() for the cases it stays silent on. The model demonstrably
			// reads it — #315's re-measurement records an answer
			// quoting "the order status is not in force" back unprompted. So this clause asks the model
			// to decide nothing. It names the token the record STATES and says what an answer naming that
			// record's drug owes the reader.
			//
			// The trigger is the serializer's CONSTANT and not a copy of its text, for the reason
			// FINDING_PREFIX is used in the few-shot below — a copy would go on teaching a token no record
			// carries the moment the mark's wording changed, which Decision 46's javadoc explicitly
			// anticipates ("A change to either string is a change to what every chart says to the model").
			// javac inlines the constant, so no behavioural assertion can tell a copy from a reference;
			// EndedOrderAnswerRuleTest.thePromptsTriggerTokenIsTheSerializersConstantAndNotACopy reads
			// this source instead.
			//
			// ONE SENTENCE. THE FIRST TWO BULLETS ARE ADDITIONS THAT WERE MEASURED AND REJECTED; THE
			// THIRD RECORDS A MUTATION THAT PASSED, AND THE FOURTH IS AN ARGUMENT AND SAYS SO. Seven
			// wordings as full
			// arms against the unchanged base, plus two single-clause mutation probes against the two
			// answer cases; the arms ran on one binary, GP-swapped through chartsearchai.llm.systemPrompt,
			// interleaved with a decoy between every sample — on another patient for the standalone cells,
			// on the same chart with another question for the fixture ones — over Decision 45's own two
			// decisive charts, the two residue charts it records, the #319 yes/no medications gate cell and
			// the two fixture charts EndedOrderAnswerRuleTest builds. ADR Decision 47 carries the ledger
			// cell by cell; what is here is why the sentence has no second half.
			//  - NO date instruction, though the ticket's title asks for the stop date. Restrictively
			//    ("give the date it was stopped only when that record states one") it left the ticket's own
			//    cell UNFIXED and dropped the activation date that cell used to carry. Positively
			//    ("together with the date it was stopped where that record carries one") it DOES fix that
			//    cell with the date in it — and on Decision 45's cell-B chart, asked what the patient is
			//    taking, replaces BOTH live drug names with a lab measurement: "The patient is
			//    currently taking: 1 Serum magnesium measurement (mg/dL) Every twelve hours [3] and ...".
			//    That is a clinical falsehood on the chart this approach was previously reverted over. The
			//    date is left to the record's own text, which already carries it wherever querystore
			//    renders one — and where it does, the answer states it without being asked to.
			//  - NO completeness half ("without dropping anything else you would have reported" / "Keep
			//    every other detail ... about that record"). It stops the rule firing at all on a
			//    single-record chart — both of EndedOrderAnswerRuleTest's ENDED-direction answer cases
			//    go red; add the
			//    half back and re-run them rather than trusting a tally here. The rider that rescues that
			//    turns the model to enumerating dose, route and frequency on every medication list: on the
			//    #319 gate cell every one of its citations went from a mix of supported and unsupported to
			//    unsupported throughout. Trading a
			//    correct answer's citations into red is the #201/#302 failure class.
			//  - The completeness half breaks the rule with EITHER verb, which is worth stating because
			//    the obvious reading is that the verb is what matters. It is not: swap "say in the same
			//    sentence" for "add to the sentence naming it" and leave the half out, and both answer
			//    cases still pass. Mutate one thing at a time here — a two-word change measured against a
			//    two-clause change taught this file a false rule once already, and the mutation that
			//    refutes it takes one targeted test run.
			//  - ONE BRANCH — and this one is NOT in the ledger above; it is an argument, and the
			//    positive half it declines has no arm of its own. What KEEPS it one branch is
			//    EndedOrderAnswerRuleTest.theSystemPromptStatesTheRuleForAnOrderThatIsNotInForce,
			//    which asks this rule's whole SPAN — between the "Drug reference" sentence and the
			//    "Safety finding" one — to be exactly these two sentences, and asks the prompt to
			//    name a "drug-order record" exactly once. Adding a half here reddens it; that method's
			//    javadoc says which shapes it does and does not see. Nothing about a record carrying NO mark: the mark is silent wherever the
			//    module could not establish the answer (SerializedRecord.getOrderActive() owns that
			//    list), so a clause speaking for the silent case would assert exactly what the silence
			//    exists to withhold. That is a property of the CLAUSE, not a guarantee about the answer:
			//    measured on a chart carrying an unevaluable order beside marked ones, the model still
			//    grouped the unmarked record in with "no longer in force". The clause does not say it;
			//    nothing here stops the model saying it. And nothing about a record marked IN FORCE: Decision 45's residue is
			//    that a positive currency sentence makes the model re-state a live order in prose instead
			//    of copying a field list, and prose loses fields and can invent them.
			//
			// THE COSTS. NOT a closed list, and it must not be re-labelled into one: ADR Decision 47's
			// ledger and trade-offs are canonical for what this wording pays, and what is here is the
			// three a re-wording has to re-run FIRST, worst first. Earlier forms of this comment said
			// "TWO costs, stated rather than hidden" and left the first bullet out — that bullet was
			// measured a commit BEFORE the second was written, so re-labelling the list around the two
			// that happened to be adjacent closed an enumeration that had never contained the worst of
			// them. If you add a cost, do not restate the count.
			//  - A FABRICATED STOP DATE — the worst thing the clause does, and the reason to re-run
			//    cell H before any other cell. On a chart carrying SEVERAL records of ONE drug where
			//    some carry ". Stopped: <date>" and one (lapsed by auto_expire_date) does not, asked
			//    "has his Triomune-30 been stopped?", the answer states that record's ORDER date as a
			//    stop date and CITES it — 3/3, where the base arm never names that record at all. It is
			//    a false clinical fact carrying a citation, and it violates this prompt's own "Never
			//    infer, assume, or add information not explicitly stated in the records". FIVE further
			//    wordings failed to remove it (a prohibition on dating the ending; a prohibition on
			//    re-using the record's other dates; a sentence stating what the field does and does not
			//    say; dropping the word "ended"; a status-only clause naming no ending at all — all
			//    five fabricate, 3/3 each), which is what makes it a property of the CLAUSE rather than
			//    of its phrasing. It ships because its precondition is narrow — several ended records
			//    of one drug disagreeing about whether their text carries an end date — and every
			//    realistic chart measured stays clean; Decision 47 carries that trade and the cells.
			//  - On the renewal chart (an ended order beside a live one for the same drug) the answer
			//    loses the dose it used to carry — "He is taking Nevirapine 400 Milligram" becomes "He is
			//    taking Nevirapine". Of the wordings measured, every one that keeps that dose pays one of
			//    the two prices in the DECLINED list above — cell B2's lab-measurement falsehood, or the
			//    fixture answer cases going red. (That phrase used to read "the two prices above", which
			//    stopped being unambiguous the moment a third cost was added between the two lists.)
			//    It is the lesser loss here because the base arm's own grounding
			//    verifier already marked that dose claim UNSUPPORTED, and the answer that replaces it is
			//    verified: that citation moves unsupported -> supported.
			//  - On a chart of ONE ended order, asked "what medications is he taking?", the answer stops
			//    naming the drug at all: "Nevirapine was ordered on 2026-07-26 [1]." becomes "No current
			//    medications are recorded.", 3/3, with NO citation. True of that patient, and it satisfies
			//    this clause vacuously — nothing is named, so nothing owes a status — but the drug, the
			//    ended status and the stop date the ticket's title asks for all leave the answer. Four of
			//    the eight measured wordings keep it naming the drug AND its status; each is excluded by
			//    another cell (the ticket's own cell unfixed, cell B2's lab-measurement falsehood, or both
			//    of EndedOrderAnswerRuleTest's ENDED-direction answer cases red). Decision 47's A3 note
			//    carries which, and the
			//    base on that cell is NOT settled — four runs, three different base answers.

			// SAFETY GUIDANCE LIVES IN TWO PLACES: this record-type sentence (#110, #112) and the
			// safety/suitability paragraph below (#107, #112). They are one rule split across the
			// prompt's two natural sections — what a record type means here, and how to answer a
			// safety question — and both are gated on the same thing: a "Safety finding" record,
			// which DrugReferenceInjector emits only when DrugSafetyValidator found something.
			// Change either and read the other: #112 diagnosed a missing verdict rule from this
			// paragraph alone and proposed adding one beside it, which would have left two
			// contradictory lead instructions in one prompt. That was ruled out on the issue itself,
			// on the measured history that added instructions in this area regress — all three
			// candidate arms in eval/drift-metric/README.md did, and were reverted. Its lead clause

			+ "Records beginning with \"Safety finding\" ARE about this patient — this module derived "
			+ "them from the patient's own records — so a safety finding naming the drug asked about "
			+ "means the records DO address that drug: answer the question from that finding and cite "
			+ "it, and never put a sentence saying the records do not address the drug in front of "
			+ "one, which contradicts it in the same breath. "
			+ "Include ALL relevant records in your answer — never omit any for brevity. "
			+ "Cite EVERY record you reference by its number in brackets (e.g. [1], [3]). "
			+ "Respond with ONLY a JSON object with a \"reasoning\" string, then an \"answer\" string "

			// THE TWO SENTENCES AFTER THE FIRST ARE ISSUE #214's FIX, and each answers a different
			// half of what was measured. "Name what is missing" alone is ambiguous when the chart is
			// empty: normalizeRecords() has just told the model "This patient has no records matching
			// this query", so on one reading the missing thing IS the records and paraphrasing the
			// placeholder satisfies the instruction. The clinician cannot act on that answer — "no
			// imaging is recorded", "the chart failed to load" and "the question was not understood"
			// are three different situations and "No patient records were provided." does not
			// distinguish them (issue #94 is the same confusion of the slice for the patient).

			// Measured over the 19 absent-data cases against the bundled model, empty chart, at

			// the patient received?" → "No patient records were provided.") did so in three identical
			// runs. Reversing the order the cases are asked in kept those two and added a third ("any
			// episodes?" at the head of the run), so the reading is not a property of a topic — it is
			// the ambiguity resolving under whatever the KV cache holds. Every passing answer lifted a
			// contiguous noun phrase out of the question ("No imaging studies are recorded.", "No
			// social history is recorded."); the robust failures are the questions that offer none to
			// lift, which is why the second sentence asks for a noun phrase rather than only forbidding
			// the placeholder echo. After this hunk, all 19 name their topic in both orders.
			+ "If no records are relevant, name what is missing. Name the TOPIC the query asked "
			+ "about, as a noun phrase of your own when the query states it as a verb — asked "
			+ "\"does the patient drink?\": \"No alcohol use is recorded.\" Reporting only that "
			+ "records are missing names nothing.\n"
			+ "When the query is a yes/no question (\"any allergies?\", \"is the patient "
			+ "hypertensive\"), begin the answer with an explicit verdict, then the complete cited "
			+ "evidence. Start with \"Yes\" ONLY when a record explicitly names what is asked — a "

			// The two question shapes named here are EXAMPLES of this paragraph's scope, not its

			// here was RUN as an arm of ADR Decision 72's A/B and refuted: it produced the cleanest
			// two-order leads of the three arms and dropped a finding from the eight-order cell. Do not re-propose it.
			+ "The same rules apply to safety and suitability questions (\"is it safe to give "
			+ "X\", \"can we start X\"): when no record addresses the drug or intervention asked "
			+ "about, the whole answer is one sentence stating that the records do not address "
			+ "it — never \"Yes\" or \"No\" — and cite nothing with it: a record about a "
			+ "different drug or condition is never evidence for or against it, and attaching "
			+ "one only suggests a connection the records do not make. "
			+ "When a safety finding DOES name the drug or intervention asked about, the opposite "
			+ "branch applies, and the finding states how far it goes: begin the answer with the call "
			+ "the finding states, then the finding itself, carrying its own severity, and every "
			+ "record it rests on, cited. A finding that says it is a reason to withhold it is "
			+ "evidence against giving it: open with \"No\" and what to avoid. A finding that says it "
			+ "is a caution to note, not a reason to withhold it, is not evidence against giving the "
			+ "drug: open by stating that the drug can be given, and name the caution in the same "
			+ "sentence so it is never dropped. Where more than one finding names the drug and they "
			+ "state different strengths, the strongest governs: a finding that is a reason to "

			// ISSUE #348. Two branches for the two clauses a finding about a medication the patient

			// all is inert, six runs byte-identical. INSIDE this paragraph and never a paragraph of
			// its own: #112 proposed a lead rule beside it and that was ruled out, on the measured
			// history that added instructions in this area regress (see the comment above the
			// "Safety finding" record-type sentence). Positively gated and carrying no fallback
			// clause, because LlmProviderTest fails this paragraph on the substring "otherwise" in
			// any casing (#107 arm D).
			//
			// Placed BEFORE the never-"Yes" token that closes the paragraph, so that token's "such an
			// answer" reaches these two branches as well. That is deliberate and it is what they ask
			// for: neither branch wants a VERDICT at all — the lead is a statement about medications
			// already prescribed, which is the sentence #348 says the chip carries and the answer does
			// not — so being denied "Yes" costs them nothing, and being denied it explicitly is worth
			// more than the alternative. One of the two alternatives has a measured cost: a lead
			// instruction in a paragraph of its own is #112's refuted shape. The other — putting
			// these two branches AFTER the never-"Yes" token — has not been measured, and the
			// argument against it is legibility only: the token's own scope becomes the thing a
			// reader has to infer. Worth weighing rather than settled: one READING of ADR Decision
			// 72's first residue — §3a still opening with a bare "No —" — is that this token plus the
			// yes/no verdict paragraph above leave no other lead available on a screening question.
			// That reading is not measured either, and no arm has tried the placement.
			// The residue that belongs to the measurement rather than to this comment: on the charts
			// that already answered correctly the lead was "Yes, there are documented interactions
			// …", and these branches ask for a statement instead. Measured — both several-finding
			// cells KEEP that Yes lead with every finding, severity and citation, and ADR Decision
			// 72's "The measurement" section records the run, its three residues and the arm above.
			// Nothing in this repository can see what the model produces from these two sentences;
			// SafetyVerdictSeverityGradationTest pins what they SAY.
			+ "A finding that says it is a reason to change a medication this patient is already "

			// fix the querystore no-gate failure described below):
			//   1. List the ranked focus records (positive signal). The label says "ranked by
			//      similarity", NOT "most relevant": the querystore focus path
			//      (QueryStoreChartBuilder.searchByPatient + topK) has no relevance gate, so this
			//      list is the K nearest neighbours and is non-empty even when NOTHING in the
			//      chart is about the query. Calling them "most relevant" asserted a relevance the
			//      ranking never established and steered the LLM to answer about off-topic records
			//      ("Is she in any programs?" -> listed conditions on a patient with no programs).
			//   2. "Use these as the starting point. Also include other records ... clinically
			//      about the same topic" — soft permission to expand beyond the focus list,
			//      addresses the "thin answer" mode where the LLM treats the focus list as a
			//      hard cap and misses on-topic records elsewhere in the chart.
			//   3. "Similarity does not guarantee relevance: if none of these records are actually
			//      about the query, answer that no relevant records were found and cite nothing" —
			//      the abstention escape. Without it the focus line overrides the system prompt's
			//      "name what is missing" guidance whenever retrieval fails to gate (i.e. always,
			//      on the querystore path). Paired with the focus-mode abstention few-shot in
			//      DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.
			//   4. "Do NOT cite records about unrelated clinical topics" — addresses the
			//      "drift" mode where the LLM cites records that share keywords or chart
			//      position but aren't about the query topic.
			// Two alternative phrasings were tested and rolled back:
			//   - v3 ("LIST EVERY chart record whose primary content is ...") triggered
			//     hallucinations: invented BP values echoing record indices ("699 mmHg [691]",
			//     "714 mmHg [714]"), off-topic listings with self-correcting "Note: this is a
			//     cardiac condition, not mental health" asides, and one topic loss
			//     (karen_sanchez CKD went from kidney-relevant to listing pneumonia and bone
			//     destruction).
			//   - v4 added "Quote numeric values and dates EXACTLY ... do not invent values"
			//     on top of v2 to absorb v3's hallucination risk pre-emptively. v2 didn't
			//     have those hallucinations in the first place, and the extra directive made
			//     the LLM less willing to abstain (it started listing benign Haemangioma when
			//     asked about cancer/tumor, where v2 correctly returned "no records").

		// Decision 84 carries both measurements, the refuted alternatives and the corrections
		// earlier drafts of this comment needed; eval/drift-metric/README.md carries the five-arm
		// ledger they are rows of. Neither is reproduced here — a third copy is what the root
		// instruction file's "Documenting a decision" section forbids, and would be the copy nobody
		// re-measures. LlmInferenceService.severalFindingsAboutOneDrug is canonical for the gate.
		//
		// THESE ARE THE MEASURED BYTES, down to the SPACE in front of them, and
		// LlmProviderUserMessageTest.theAppendedClauseIsExactlyTheseBytes is what holds them as

		// one, and until that case existed the class held this string by substrings alone. A
		// rewording also stops the ledger describing the shipped clause.
		//
		// NO FEW-SHOT DEMONSTRATES THIS CLAUSE, AND THAT IS A DECISION — the one exception to the
		// mirror invariant FOCUS_HINT_LABEL's javadoc states, which points here for it. Mirroring it
		// would mean restructuring a demonstration rather than adding a line: this clause is a THIRD
		// element of the real message, a sentence between the question and the model's JSON, and every
		// "Clinician's query: " line in DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT is followed immediately by that JSON.
		// DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT's two demonstrated finding records name a different fruit each — [4]
		// Durian, [5] Lychee — so the demonstration prompt fails this clause's own gate: it carries
		// two findings and they name two subjects. And a demonstration is more instruction
		// in exactly the position where more instruction is measured to regress, so it needs its own
		// A/B and cannot be had for free. Unmeasured, and left so deliberately.
		//
		// THE BLANK-QUESTION GUARD PREVENTS NOTHING PRODUCTION CAN REACH, and is still worth having.
		// What protects the warmup's byte-PREFIX is the APPEND POSITION and neither conjunct — warmup
		// and searchStreaming's cacheSeed both build through the arity that hardcodes the flag false,
		// so no production caller can present this body with the flag true and the question blank.
		// The guard is defence against a FUTURE widening of the seed path, which cannot then carry
		// the clause without reddening warmupShouldNotCarryTheFindingEnumerationClause or
		// theClauseMustNotBreakTheWarmupPrefixForAQuestionOfAnyLength. Mutate it and read those two.
		//
		// THE SUMMARISED BRANCH IS ISSUE #403 AND SHARES EVERY ONE OF THOSE CONSTRAINTS: same
		// position, same separator, same blank-question guard, its own pinned bytes. It is the
		// OPPOSITE ask, so the two are one enum and never two flags — a message asking for both
		// would be the contradiction FindingProse exists to make unrepresentable.
