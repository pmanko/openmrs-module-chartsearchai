			// fix the querystore no-gate failure described below):
			//   1. List the ranked focus records (positive signal). The label says "ranked by
			//      similarity", NOT "most relevant": the querystore focus path
			//      (QueryStoreChartBuilder.searchByPatient + topK) has no relevance gate, so this
			//      list is the K nearest neighbours and is non-empty even when NOTHING in the
			//      chart is about the query. Calling them "most relevant" asserted a relevance the
			//      ranking never established and steered the LLM to answer about off-topic records
			//      ("Is she in any programs?" -> listed conditions on a patient with no programs).
			//   2. "Use these as the starting point. Also include other records ... clinically
			//      about the same topic" — soft permission to expand beyond the focus list,
			//      addresses the "thin answer" mode where the LLM treats the focus list as a
			//      hard cap and misses on-topic records elsewhere in the chart.
			//   3. "Similarity does not guarantee relevance: if none of these records are actually
			//      about the query, answer that no relevant records were found and cite nothing" —
			//      the abstention escape. Without it the focus line overrides the system prompt's
			//      "name what is missing" guidance whenever retrieval fails to gate (i.e. always,
			//      on the querystore path). Paired with the focus-mode abstention few-shot in
			//      DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.
			//   4. "Do NOT cite records about unrelated clinical topics" — addresses the
			//      "drift" mode where the LLM cites records that share keywords or chart
			//      position but aren't about the query topic.
			// Two alternative phrasings were tested and rolled back:
			//   - v3 ("LIST EVERY chart record whose primary content is ...") triggered
			//     hallucinations: invented BP values echoing record indices ("699 mmHg [691]",
			//     "714 mmHg [714]"), off-topic listings with self-correcting "Note: this is a
			//     cardiac condition, not mental health" asides, and one topic loss
			//     (karen_sanchez CKD went from kidney-relevant to listing pneumonia and bone
			//     destruction).
			//   - v4 added "Quote numeric values and dates EXACTLY ... do not invent values"
			//     on top of v2 to absorb v3's hallucination risk pre-emptively. v2 didn't
			//     have those hallucinations in the first place, and the extra directive made
			//     the LLM less willing to abstain (it started listing benign Haemangioma when
			//     asked about cancer/tumor, where v2 correctly returned "no records").
			// v2 wins: 40/40 on-topic vs OLD prefilter's 39/40, 16 new_better vs 16 new_worse
