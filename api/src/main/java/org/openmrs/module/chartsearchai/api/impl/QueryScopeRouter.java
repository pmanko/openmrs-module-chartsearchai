/**
 * Maps a clinician's question to the record types whose records belong <em>complete</em> in a
 * query-scoped slice chart ({@code chartsearchai.chartMode=queryScoped}). For an enumeration
 * intent ("what medications…", "any allergies?") the answer's completeness contract ("include
 * ALL relevant records — never omit any") is only satisfiable if every record of the intent's
 * type is in context — similarity top-K alone can truncate a long medication list. The typed
 * scope guarantees that by construction; the similarity top-K is still unioned in by the
 * builder as the semantic catch-all for same-topic records living in other types (e.g. a
 * medication mentioned in an obs note).
 *
 * <p>Routing is deliberately conservative: only unambiguous intent keywords map to a typed
 * scope, matched on word boundaries so substrings ("re<b>program</b>ming") never trigger.
 * A question matching SEVERAL cue sets ("any drug allergies?") carries every matched intent
 * and the builder unions their typed slices: completeness must hold for whichever intent the
 * user meant, and a union can only over-include — first-match routing instead silently
 * dropped the runner-up's completeness on exactly the type being enumerated (measured on the
 * cue patterns: "any drug allergies?" routed MEDICATIONS-only, so an allergy outside the
 * similarity top-K was invisible to an allergy enumeration). Everything cue-free — topical
 * questions like "any eye problems?" — matches nothing ({@link Intent#TOPICAL}), where the
 * slice is the similarity top-K alone and the prompt's abstention language (same contract as
 * the focus-hint path) handles the no-match case. A misroute to TOPICAL only costs typed
 * completeness; a wrong or partial typed scope would bias the slice — hence conservative
 * cues, unioned when they co-occur.
 *
 * <p>The type strings are querystore's {@code QueryDocument.resourceType} values (its
 * {@code *RecordSerializer.getResourceType()} contract): {@code drug_order},
 * {@code medication_dispense}, {@code test_order}, {@code referral_order}, {@code allergy},
 * {@code program}, {@code condition}, {@code diagnosis}, {@code visit}, {@code encounter} —
 * plus {@code patient} and {@code obs}, which this router never scopes ({@code patient} is
 * always included by the builder; {@code obs} is the similarity path's domain).
 *
 * <p>Public only so the drug-safety layer can reuse this router's classification of a question —
 * {@link #isInteractionScreening}, and the three domain predicates {@link #asksAboutMedications},
 * {@link #asksAboutAllergies} and {@link #asksAboutConditions} that scope its contraindication arm.
 * Question intent is classified here and must not be classified a second time elsewhere, which is the
 * whole of what earns a member its {@code public}: every member that is not read outside this package
 * stays package-private, and a new one becomes public only by being a classification a caller would
 * otherwise re-derive.
