/**
 * Bridge to the querystore module's read API. querystore is a required module, so it is present at
 * runtime; the service is still resolved lazily via {@link Context#getService(Class)} rather than
 * injected. A resolution or completeness failure is explicit because an unavailable chart cannot
 * safely be represented as a clinically meaningful empty chart.
 *
 * <p>{@link #build} (the fullChart mode) always fetches the full patient chart via
 * {@link QueryStoreService#getPatientChartRead(String)} so the chart bytes sent to
 * the LLM do not vary with the question — that's the property
 * llama-server's KV-cache reuse needs in order to skip ~99% of the prefill on
 * subsequent queries for the same patient. Since issue #317 they are a function of the patient AND
 * of their order status as read at assembly time, which is a narrowing of that property rather than
 * a loss of it: the bytes are still question-independent, but an order lapsing by its
 * {@code auto_expire_date} — or a transient failure of the order read, which drops every mark at
 * once — changes them with no underlying data change and no index change. The reused prefix then
 * ends at the record whose mark moved, and everything after it is prefilled again. How much that
 * costs depends on where that record sits, and a chart is ordered most-recent-first across ALL record
 * types. On the 3.7.1 demo database's most-prescribed patient — the one with the most drug orders,
 * which is not the one with the most records — all 8 of their drug orders are newer than every one of
 * their observations, conditions, diagnoses, encounters and visits, and older than 8 of their 9
 * allergies, so the first drug-order record is around the tenth line of several hundred and
 * "everything after it" is most of the chart. Do not carry that shape to another patient, and do not
 * read it as a worst case: what decides the position is every record type's dates, and this is one
 * patient's. It is the correct outcome — the
 * cached prefix asserted something that is no longer true —
 * and {@code appendLiveAge} already made the bytes clock-dependent in the same way, though not at
 * the same cadence: a birthday is once a year, and a finite-duration prescription ending is
 * routine. It does not arise in the shipped {@code queryScoped} default, where nothing persists a
 * KV prefix at all. {@link #buildScoped}
 * ({@code chartsearchai.chartMode=queryScoped}) deliberately trades that property away: it
 * assembles a small question-dependent slice whose prefill is cheap enough to pay fresh on
 * every query, so cold patients need no warmup at all. When
 * {@code chartsearchai.embedding.preFilter=true} and the question is non-blank,
 * additionally calls {@link QueryStoreService#searchByPatient(String, String, int)}
 * to obtain a relevance ranking, then renders those hits as a short
 * "Records ranked by similarity to the query: ..." focus-hint line in the LLM prompt
 * (handled in {@code LlmProvider.buildUserMessage} via the
 * {@link PatientChart#getFocusIndices()} payload). The hint biases the LLM's
 * attention without removing records the LLM needs for negative reasoning.
 *
 * <p>The same mark also makes those bytes PRIVILEGE-dependent, which the clock never did. The order
 * read needs core's {@code Get Orders}; {@code WarmupExecutor} and the prewarm sweep run through
 * {@code Daemon.runInDaemonThread}, and {@code Context.hasPrivilege} answers true unconditionally on
 * a daemon thread, so the prefix they prime and pin is always assembled WITH the mark. A request
 * thread on a role that lacks the privilege assembles the same patient's chart WITHOUT it — the read
 * throws, {@link #readOrderCurrency} catches, every mark is dropped — and under {@code fullChart} the
 * KV entry is keyed on a hash of the chart text ({@code LocalLlmEngine.kvCacheKey}), so that role's
 * prompt can never match the warmed prefix at all: not a shortened reuse, none. Warmup and the whole
 * durable corpus buy it nothing and every query pays a full prefill. Recorded, not fixed: making the
 * two threads assemble the same bytes would mean either dropping the mark for everyone or escalating
 * the request thread's privileges to match the daemon's, and the second is not this module's call to
 * make. The remedy is the operator's — grant the role {@code Get Orders}; the README's privileges
 * section says who already holds it on a stock install.
 *
 * <p>The {@code protected resolve*} methods and the package-private
 * {@link #setChartSerializer} are test seams, not an extension point.
 * Subclassing this bean outside the test package is not supported.

	 * {@link #readingOf} logs its own per-order failure at WARN resting on that same argument; what
