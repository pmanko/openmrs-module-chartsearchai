/**
 * Reports an answer that REPRODUCES a stretch of a cited reference record and then, inside the
 * sentence it was copying, states different words (issue #337) — the prose counterpart of
 * {@link ClassCodeFidelityCheck}, and the mechanism the README claimed already existed.
 *
 * <p><b>The failure.</b> Measured live on the 3.7.1 standalone. The chip, straight from the
 * knowledge base, said <em>"Coadministration of local anesthetics with other oxidizing agents that
 * can also <b>induce methemoglobinemia</b> such as antimalarials…"</em>; the answer, citing that
 * finding, said <em>"…oxidizing agents that can also <b>increase the risk</b>"</em>. The risk of
 * what is no longer in the sentence, and methaemoglobinaemia — the entire content of that Major
 * rating, and an oxygen-saturation problem to watch for — reaches the clinician nowhere. A second
 * capture deleted <em>"neuromuscular blockers, aminoglycoside antibiotics,"</em> from a botulinum
 * toxin warning whose partner, neomycin, IS an aminoglycoside: what survived was a generic
 * statement that no longer connects to the drug named in the same sentence.
 *
 * <p><b>Why nothing else can see it.</b> A reference-group citation skips Tier-2 entailment
 * entirely (demote-only, #106/#122) and Tier-1 cosine barely moves when one phrase inside a long
 * recitation changes. {@link ClassCodeFidelityCheck} compares one token shape and says nothing
 * about prose. The {@code safetyWarnings} chips carry the true text but are a parallel list that
 * nothing reconciles against the answer — which is what this repository asserted they did, in every
 * place the claim was written; ADR Decision 61 names them and says how they were found.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does and does not do.</b> It reports and it STATES; it never rewrites. Editing a
 * clinician-facing sentence is a larger decision than this check is licensed to make, and since #201
 * a reference-group citation publishes no verdict to carry one. It does not stop the paraphrase
 * either — that is the ticket's option 1, a prompt or assembly change, and this check is the
 * instrument that would measure whether such a change worked.
 *
 * <p><b>Since the second round of issue #337 it also reaches the wire</b>, as the citation indexes it
 * warned about: {@code ChartAnswer.getUnfaithfullyRenderedCitations()}, published as the
 * {@code unfaithfullyRenderedCitations} response key. What travels is the INDEX and never a word of
 * either text. That accessor is canonical for what is stated and ADR Decision 74 for why — including
 * why no record prose goes with it, and why the sibling class-code check publishes nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>Conservative by construction</b>, because a check that cries wolf is worse than no check:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>it says nothing unless the answer REPRODUCES at least {@link #MIN_REPRODUCED_WORDS}
 *       consecutive words of a record it cites. With nothing reproduced there is no reproduction to
 *       be unfaithful to, and this is what keeps ordinary prose out: an answer that summarises in
 *       its own words shares only short phrases with its sources;</li>
 *   <li>it reports a SUBSTITUTION and never a truncation. Where the answer stops reproducing and
 *       ends its sentence, it has stated nothing the record does not, and reporting it would fire
 *       on every answer that quotes one clause of a 150-word mechanism — which is most of them.
 *       That under-reports the ticket's weaker cousin, a hazard dropped by stopping early, and it
 *       is the safe direction for a check whose failure mode is being ignored. Half of that cousin
 *       is covered since the same issue's third round, by {@link SafetyFindingSeverityFidelityCheck}:
 *       a finding's RATING is a deterministic word rather than prose, so whether it survived needs
 *       no reproduction threshold. The mechanism half still needs one and still has none;</li>
 *   <li>it treats a record SENTENCE reproduced whole as faithful however the answer goes on. That
 *       exit is also what keeps the clauses {@code DrugReferenceInjector.renderFinding} appends out
 *       of the comparison at the seam: the detail is passed through
 *       {@code DrugSafetyValidator.endSentence} whenever a clause follows it, so a strength clause
 *       — {@code " This finding is a reason to withhold it."} and, since issue #348, any of the
 *       three counterparts beside it — always opens a new record sentence.
 *       It covers the SEAM and not the clause's interior — a reproduction that runs from the
 *       detail into the clause and diverges inside it is reported, and so is one inside a clause
 *       long enough to clear {@link #MIN_REPRODUCED_WORDS} on its own, which every clause but
 *       {@code STRENGTH_WITHHOLD} is. Since issue #349 a further clause can follow
 *       the detail, the chart-order bridge, and it is why that clause's own lead ENDS a
 *       sentence rather than introducing its items with a colon: the lead alone clears
 *       {@link #MIN_REPRODUCED_WORDS}, so joined to the items it would put invariant
 *       boilerplate inside a sentence whose interior carries order displays. Its ITEMS are
 *       still interior, and that is inherent to carrying variable content. A citation marker
 *       issue #379 appends to an item is invisible here, by {@link #wordsWithoutMarkers} and
 *       deliberately; so are punctuation and case, which {@link Words#of} drops for every
 *       operand. That residue is
 *       accepted rather than excluded:
 *       excluding it means teaching this check where a finding's own prose ends, which is knowledge
 *       that belongs to {@code renderFinding} and would be a second copy of it here;</li>
 *   <li><b>support is POOLED across the cited records</b>, exactly as {@link ClassCodeFidelityCheck}
 *       pools it for a class code: a continuation ANY cited record explains — by ending, by opening
 *       a new sentence, or by simply continuing the same way — is not a divergence, whatever a
 *       second record's layout makes of it. One mechanism string really is rendered into TWO records
 *       that are cited together (the {@code safety_finding}'s detail and the {@code drug_reference}'s
 *       {@code "; "}-joined interaction item) wherever that partner is PROMOTED — since issue #355 a
 *       record with nothing patient-specific to show normally carries names and severities rather
 *       than mechanism prose, which leaves this check little to judge on the commonest record. Normally, not always:
 *       a rule carrying no token and no ATC has no name to shorten to, so an operator-authored
 *       dataset still renders paragraphs there ({@code drug-reference-unpromoted-tail-budget.json} is
 *       one). That is where this came from — but on that
 *       arrangement the weak gap question now lets the reference record explain its own continuation,
 *       so the pooling is not what keeps THAT answer quiet and an earlier draft of this bullet said
 *       it was. What it still decides is the case where a second cited record ends where the first
 *       diverges, and the case where one record's own reproduction carries on past the point another
 *       stops matching; both have cases of their own. Only the cited REFERENCE records
 *       are asked, and widening that to the chart records is refused rather than merely unnecessary:
 *       a chart record is the patient's own charted prose, which this module never asked the answer
 *       to reproduce, and the WARN carries the patient id
 *       ({@code aCitedChartRecordIsNeverComparedAgainstTheAnswer}). The third leg — "by simply
 *       continuing the same way" — is narrower than it reads: an explaining record's own overlap
 *       must itself reach {@link #MIN_REPRODUCED_WORDS}, so a record that carries the continuation
 *       but joins the answer eleven words later is never consulted;</li>
 *   <li>it compares WORDS — runs of letters and digits, lower-cased — so punctuation cannot make
 *       two identical words differ. The sentence-boundary bit each word carries is deliberately NOT
 *       part of that equality: were it, a record writing {@code "(e.g. chloroquine"} against an
 *       answer writing {@code "(e.g., chloroquine"} would break the reproduction and then report
 *       two IDENTICAL words as a substitution, turning a boundary misreading into a false
 *       accusation instead of silence.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Which way a boundary misreading fails, and why the gap question is the WEAK one.</b> Both
 * bit-driven conditions are SILENCING, so a gap read as a sentence end can only add silence: on the
 * record side it takes the "reproduced a sentence and moved on" exit, on the answer side the
 * "stopped copying" one. So a misread boundary costs a REPORT and never causes one — but only
 * because the bit is {@link ChartSearchAiUtils#mayEndASentence}, which says yes to a terminator
 * ANYWHERE in the gap. Asking {@link ChartSearchAiUtils#SENTENCE_BOUNDARY} instead makes that false
 * in the other direction, and it was measured rather than argued: it wants the terminator followed
 * IMMEDIATELY by whitespace, so an answer that quotes the record verbatim, closes the quotation
 * ({@code ."}) and starts its own next sentence has no answer-side boundary, falls through to the
 * report, and is accused of a substitution it did not make
 * ({@code aQuotationTheAnswerClosedBeforeItsOwnNextSentenceIsNotReported}, which reddens under that
 * predicate).
 *
 * <p><b>An ELISION is a report, and that is the intended reading rather than a false alarm.</b> An
 * answer that reproduces a record's opening, marks a cut with {@code …} or an em dash, and resumes
 * is reported — it states no word the record does not, and it has still dropped content out of a
 * sentence a clinician reads, which is issue #337's SECOND capture exactly (<em>"neuromuscular
 * blockers, aminoglycoside antibiotics,"</em> excised from a botulinum toxin warning whose partner
 * is an aminoglycoside). What that costs is a WARN whose wording — "states different words" — reads
 * oddly of a marked cut. What it MISSES is the same elision written with three ASCII dots, whose
 * first dot the weak gap question reads as a sentence end: {@code ...} is silent where {@code …} is
 * reported. Which elisions are seen therefore depends on the glyph the model chose, and no
 * arrangement of these two rules removes that — closing it means a gap question that is not
 * silencing, and then a closed quotation is a false report again.
 *
 * <p><b>What the WARN carries, and what it deliberately does not.</b> The patient, the cited
 * record's index, how many words were reproduced, and the word offset in the record at which the
 * reproduction stopped agreeing. <b>No prose from either side.</b> A first draft logged a window of
 * the record's own continuation on the reasoning that a reference record carries no patient data;
 * that reasoning is false. A {@code safety_finding}'s detail embeds this patient's own prescription
 * string ({@code "… interacts with active order Warfarin 5mg"}) and a {@code drug_reference} record
 * carries {@code DrugReferenceInjector}'s three reading sections, whose clauses name this patient's
 * recorded allergens and conditions — so a window could print a named allergy beside the patient
 * id. Offsets identify the divergence without quoting it, which is the discipline
 * {@link ClassCodeFidelityCheck} already states ("Neither the answer nor the record text is logged:
 * they carry patient data").
 *
 * <p><b>Where it runs.</b> Both answer paths — {@link LlmInferenceService#search} and
 * {@code searchStreaming} — beside the class-code check and for the same reasons it states there:
 * not the progressive-reasoning preview, which resolves no citations, not a cached answer, which
 * was checked when it was produced, and not the model's reasoning, which cites nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>The two pooling legs are pinned on ASSEMBLED records, and that is deliberate.</b> Neither
 * {@code Reproductions.explained} (another cited record ended innocently here) nor
 * {@code carriedThrough} (some reproduction carries on past here) is reachable on the bundled
 * sixteen-entry excerpt: the two records the injector produces for one question carry the same
 * mechanism string, so they diverge together, and no record there states one passage twice. Both
 * shapes are ordinary in the data this runs on — a rendered reference record whose partner was
 * PROMOTED is a {@code "; "}-joined list of per-partner items and DDInter partners routinely share a
 * mechanism, and since issue #355 a record with nothing patient-specific to show normally carries
 * names and severities instead, per the bullet above — so their cases build the record rather than injecting
 * one. That is the right operand here, because this check is a pure function of an answer and a
 * record's TEXT and the cases beside them already pin that it runs over production-rendered records
 * on the real answer path. Both were unpinned when they were written,
 * and a review's mutation sweep is what said so.
 *
 * <p><b>One regression this file cannot see.</b> Its gate asks
 * {@link ChartSearchAiUtils#referenceGroup} rather than testing {@code resourceType} against a type
 * name, per CLAUDE.md's rule for a question that is not about grading — so a reference type added
 * later is covered without this class changing. Nothing guards that: hardcoding the pair here leaves
 * the whole suite green. The sentence this replaces said a THIRD reference-group type would close
 * it; issue #354 added one ({@code drug_class_note}) and re-measured — the hardcode still ships
 * green, because no case drives a record of that type through this check. What would close it is a
 * case that does, not another type. ADR Decision 61 carries the same residue.
