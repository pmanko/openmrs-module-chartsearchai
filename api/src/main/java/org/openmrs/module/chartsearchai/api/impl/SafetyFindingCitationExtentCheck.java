/**
 * Measures how many injected safety findings the prompt carried against how many the answer cited —
 * issue <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/395">#395</a>. A
 * deterministic count: no model call, no embedding, no cosine floor. Of the answer it reads the
 * citation markers it anchors — through the shared decode step, never a dialect of its own — and
 * whether there is any prose at all, which gates the WARN
 * (issue <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/409">#409</a>),
 * pinned by
 * {@code ArchitectureGuardTest.safetyFindingCitationExtentCheckReachesMarkersOnlyThroughTheSharedDecodeStep}
 * for the first of those.
 *
 * <p><b>The failure.</b> Measured live on a RefApp 3.7.1 standalone against the bundled knowledge
 * base, with the drug-reference layer enabled and {@code chartMode=fullChart}, two runs
 * byte-identical. A <em>"should i give Amlodipine?"</em> answer opened <em>"No — Amlodipine should
 * not be given"</em> and enumerated six active orders, each carrying its own rating and its own
 * citation. The screen had raised SEVEN interaction findings and the injector had written all seven
 * into the prompt, each at its own citation index; the seventh — Amlodipine against her active
 * {@code Advil 400mg}, Moderate — reached the prose nowhere. A clinician reading the answer got six
 * reasons to withhold where the module had screened seven, with nothing saying a seventh existed.
 *
 * <p><b>Why nothing else can see it.</b> {@link SafetyFindingSeverityFidelityCheck} asks whether a
 * cited finding's rating reached the prose, and on that answer it correctly read {@code []} — it
 * asks of the WHOLE answer and <em>Moderate</em> appeared six times, so a seventh Moderate finding
 * dropped entirely is invisible to it by construction. {@link ReferenceProseFidelityCheck} reports
 * a SUBSTITUTION inside a reproduction and that answer reproduced nothing.
 * {@link ActiveOrderCitationFidelityCheck} judges the citations a claim offered, and a finding that
 * made no claim offered none. {@link ClassCodeFidelityCheck} compares one ATC token shape.
 * {@link DosingCeilingFidelityCheck} asks a question about a cited REFERENCE record and none about
 * a finding. The residue was already named, in
 * {@code SafetyFindingSeverityFidelityCheck}'s own javadoc quoting the prose check's <em>"a hazard
 * dropped by stopping early"</em>; this is the half of it that citation makes deterministic.
 *
 * <p><b>What it compares.</b> Two populations it derives nothing itself:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>CARRIED — the {@code safety_finding} records in the chart the prompt was built from, which
 *       {@code DrugReferenceInjector}'s findings loop writes one-per-finding and filters not at all.
 *       Never the {@code safetyWarnings} chips, which are a different and usually larger population
 *       (seventeen against seven on the measured run) and which CLAUDE.md forbids as the source of
 *       an extent;</li>
 *   <li>CITED — the subset of those the answer ANCHORED: what
 *       {@link LlmInferenceService#extractCitedReferences} admitted, narrowed to the indexes a
 *       marker in the prose carries. {@link #citedFindingIndexes} is canonical for what each of
 *       the three tests contributes and for what a blank answer means there; ADR Decision 94 is
 *       canonical for what that supersedes in Decision 83. A citation the MODULE attached (issue
 *       #305) is not one the
 *       answer made and is not counted; that filter is belt and braces on today's path, where only
 *       the two contraindication factories set the flag and they set it on chart records rather
 *       than findings, and it is here because the rule that a scorer counts the model's own
 *       citations is stated of this module generally.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>A COUNT and deliberately not an accusation</b>, which is the one design decision in this
 * class. Over the unit of one finding the residues run in BOTH directions — an answer that states a
 * finding in prose and omits its marker would be falsely accused, and one that cites a marker while
 * saying nothing about it would be missed — and that is exactly the condition ADR Decision 81 gives
 * for publishing the base rather than a per-item accusation. Naming the uncited indexes on the WIRE
 * would make each of those residues a claim about a specific finding; naming them in the log makes
 * them a lead for a maintainer, which is what they are.
 *
 * <p><b>Conservative by construction</b>, for the reasons its siblings are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>it reports nothing where the prompt carried no finding. On the shipped default
 *       {@code chartsearchai.drugReference.enabled} is false, so the injector never runs and this
 *       returns a zeroed statement before touching the citations;</li>
 *   <li>a BLANK or absent answer is silent — the WARN only. The extent is still STATED for it, and
 *       that difference from its siblings is deliberate: they judge prose and a degenerate output
 *       has none to judge, while this one counts citations and a blank answer's really do
 *       resolve — {@link #citedFindingIndexes} carries why. Counting what did resolve is a fact;
 *       reporting it as a dropped hazard would not be;</li>
 *   <li>it narrows no list a client receives. The reference list stays
 *       {@code extractCitedReferences}' union, so an answer whose array named a finding its prose
 *       did not publishes that finding as a reference beside a {@code cited} that excludes it —
 *       divergence by design, and ADR Decision 94 carries why the union is not narrowed with it.
 *       What its READING narrows is no longer this count alone: {@link SafetyFindingSeverityFidelityCheck}
 *       takes {@link #citedFindingIndexes} as well, so an accusation there cannot name a finding
 *       this count called uncited (ADR Decision 97);</li>
 *   <li>it never rewrites the answer, and it names no word of the answer or of any record — both
 *       carry patient data, the discipline {@link ClassCodeFidelityCheck} states. A citation index
 *       is the module's own bookkeeping.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>What it cannot see</b>, stated rather than left to be found:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>whether a cited finding was stated CORRECTLY, or stated at all — a question this count
 *       does not ask, which is why {@code cited == carried} is not a certificate;</li>
 *   <li>a finding the answer states in prose without anchoring a marker for it, which it counts as
 *       uncited, and a finding whose marker it anchors while saying nothing about it, which it
 *       counts as cited. Both are why this publishes a base and not an accusation;</li>
 *   <li>a marker the shared decode step cannot read, which
 *       {@code LlmAnswerExtractor.normalizeSlashCitations} leaves intact on purpose. A finding
 *       anchored only there is counted uncited; ADR Decision 94 is canonical for the mechanism and
 *       for why the count is conservative in that direction by mandate;</li>
 *   <li>whether an uncited finding MATTERED. The injector renders findings the screen raised, and
 *       not every one of them bears on the question the way the reported seventh did.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Where it runs.</b> Of {@link #measureFindingCitations}, which is this class's published
 * measurement: both answer paths, {@link LlmInferenceService#search} and {@code searchStreaming}, so
 * the endpoint users hit is covered. Not the progressive-reasoning preview, which discards its
 * answer and resolves no citations, and not a cached answer, which was measured when it was produced
 * — the same scoping its siblings state. {@link #carriedFindingIndexes} is this class's other
 * published projection of that population; its javadoc is
 * canonical for what it is for, and for what {@code measureFindingCitations} shares with it rather
 * than calling it.

	 * replaces asked for when it said to keep the method composed if one returned (issue #409).
	 * {@link LlmInferenceService#severalFindingsAboutOneDrug} counts the shared walk's own records,

	 * {@code FindingEnumerationClauseContextTest.theSharedWalkHandsTheFindingsBackInTheOrderTheInjectorWroteThem}'s

	 *
	 * <p>Keyed on the INDEX, the injector's own sequential numbering — one increment per finding
	 * record, in the sole producer of these mappings — so it is unique across a chart by
	 * construction and this set counts records rather than folding any. That is what the leg above
	 * observes, one entry per finding against this set.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Nothing reads this set's ITERATION ORDER either</b>, so the {@code LinkedHashSet} is a
	 * convenience and not a contract: a {@code HashSet} or a {@code TreeSet} here is INERT, measured,

	 * {@code carried} is what keeps a bracketed clinical value out: a chart has no record at that
	 * index, so no membership test against the resolution is doing that work. The MARKERS are what
	 * #409 added, and they are what decides a non-blank answer — the resolution admits the UNION of
	 * the model's structured array and its inline markers, deliberately and for the reference list's

	 * <p><b>So for a NON-BLANK answer the resolution test is inert today, and that is measured

	 * {@link SafetyFindingSeverityFidelityCheck} takes this reading for a per-citation ACCUSATION, so

	 * accusation there. Inert over today's data, load-bearing over the contract.
	 *
	 * <p><b>A blank or null answer keeps the resolution alone.</b> There is no prose to anchor
