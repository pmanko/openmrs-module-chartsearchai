/**
 * Reports a rating the answer attaches to a cited safety finding that carries NONE — issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/560">#560</a>, ADR
 * Decision 128. {@link SafetyFindingSeverityFidelityCheck}'s question asked in the opposite direction:
 * that one asks whether a finding's rating survives into the answer, and by construction says nothing
 * about a record with no rating. A deterministic comparison, no model call.
 *
 * <p><b>The failure.</b> Sarah Taylor's chart carries {@code Prednisone Co 5mg} and recorded allergies
 * to dexamethasone and hydrocortisone. Her dexamethasone cross-reactivity finding has no rating, and its
 * record says <em>"No severity is rated for this finding."</em> ({@code DrugReferenceInjector}'s
 * {@code FINDING_NO_SEVERITY}, ADR Decision 123). Answers still called it <em>"a Major finding"</em>, on
 * {@code main} and on PR #554, and the issue records that every wording lever tried on this family
 * failed or moved the fault.
 *
 * <p><b>Which findings carry no rating is not this class's decision.</b> It reads
 * {@link RecordMapping#getFindingUnrated()}, written once by the injector: a finding with no rating of its
 * own, whose record says so — that sentence, or a condition-mediated finding's own "this finding has no
 * severity of its own". {@link RecordMapping#getFindingSeverity()} being {@code null} could not serve: it
 * also answers for a rating {@code DrugSafetyValidator.statableRating} declines and for a rating the
 * record does not state, and an answer stating either has attached nothing the finding lacks.
 *
 * <p><b>The unit is the SENTENCE citing the unrated finding</b>, split by
 * {@link ChartSearchAiUtils#SENTENCE_BOUNDARY}, as the issue's owner decided. The sibling's whole-answer
 * unit cannot work here, because "Major" elsewhere in the answer is exactly the false report. A rating
 * word in that sentence is reported only where no finding the sentence cites, the unrated one included,
 * carries that rating ({@code aCitedFindingCarries} says what carrying is for a finding carrying a rating
 * and for one carrying none), which keeps silent a rating quoted from another finding's detail beside it
 * — PR #554's fourth run. Asking the unrated one too goes past the owner's wording, "no OTHER finding
 * cited in the same sentence", deliberately: its cost is the <em>What it cannot see</em> item on a
 * rating the judged finding's OWN record states.
 *
 * <p><b>Which findings a sentence cites is {@link SafetyFindingCitationExtentCheck#citedFindingIndexes}</b>,
 * asked of the sentence: the ONE reading of that question (issue #409), with the #305 filter and the
 * resolution's admission inside it, so a bracketed clinical value or a citation the module attached is
 * never one here.
 *
 * <p><b>The vocabulary is {@link DrugSafetyValidator#statableRatings()}</b>, the ratings
 * {@code statableRating} states; this class spells no severity literal. The scan is
 * {@link ChartSearchAiUtils#statesWord}, the word-boundary, case-insensitive scan the sibling and the
 * injector share, so "majority" is not "Major" and "**major**" is.
 *
 * <p><b>What it cannot see, or reports wrongly</b>, stated rather than left to be found:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>"Unknown severity" attached to an unrated finding — ADR Decision 123 measured that shape too.
 *       {@code statableRating} declines {@code unknown}, and reading it would report correct prose such
 *       as "its severity is unknown";</li>
 *   <li>a rating attached to the unrated finding in a sentence that also cites a finding carrying that
 *       rating — the enumeration sentence ADR Decision 76 refuted sentence scoping with. The
 *       exemption is what buys the #554 fourth run's silence, and this is its cost;</li>
 *   <li>a rating the judged finding's OWN record states, attached to that finding. The exemption asks the
 *       unrated finding itself, so correct prose reproducing its record ("Metformin is rated Major in
 *       lactic acidosis") stays silent, and so does the defect in the same word: a condition-mediated
 *       finding's record states each drug-disease rating, which on the {@code major} derived tier is Major,
 *       so "Metformin has a Major interaction with her stavudine and lamivudine [n]" is not reported; and an
 *       operator dataset's note using a rating word in another sense ("moderate to severe hepatic
 *       impairment") exempts that word for its finding;</li>
 *   <li>a marker placed after its sentence's terminator ("…a Major finding. [354]"), which the
 *       splitter puts in the next sentence: the finding's own sentence is then silent, and the next
 *       one's rating, if any, is attached to it;</li>
 *   <li>a rating the sentence owes to a co-cited finding that carries it but whose record does not state
 *       it — an operator dataset's note that omits the rating — IS reported, that finding's
 *       {@code getFindingSeverity()} being null;</li>
 *   <li>a rating the sentence owes to a co-cited record that is not a finding — a {@code drug_reference}
 *       record lists its interactions with their ratings — IS reported. The owner's decision exempts a
 *       rating another FINDING carries;</li>
 *   <li>a rating word used otherwise — negated ("not Major"), or in ordinary English ("a minor
 *       rash") — is reported.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>It reports the CITATION and the rating word, never a word of the answer or of a record — both
 * carry patient data; the rating is the module's closed vocabulary. It never rewrites the answer: a
 * rewrite would be the module editing what the model said.
 *
 * <p><b>Where it runs.</b> Both answer paths, {@link LlmInferenceService#search} and
 * {@code searchStreaming} — on the latter after the ungrounded handoff, so the early {@code done} states
 * {@code null}, as the sibling's does. Not a module-composed answer, which no model wrote.
