/**
 * A {@link CancellationSignal} that can also forcibly interrupt whatever blocking resource a
 * provider is currently waiting on. {@code isCancelled()} alone is enough for the "check at my
 * next natural checkpoint" contract {@link CancellationSignal} documents, but a provider blocked
 * inside one long synchronous call (e.g. an HTTP transport reading an SSE response
 * body) has no such checkpoint to poll — it has to be unblocked from another thread. Binding the
 * open {@link Closeable} here lets {@link #cancel()} do exactly that: closing it causes the
 * blocked read to fail with an {@code IOException}, which also tears down the underlying HTTP
 * connection to the far side (letting it observe the disconnect and free its own resources).
