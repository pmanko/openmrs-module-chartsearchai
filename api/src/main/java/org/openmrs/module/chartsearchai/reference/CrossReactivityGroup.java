/**
 * A curated cross-reactivity group loaded from {@code cross-reactivity-groups.json}:
 * a named family of drugs, expressed as ATC code prefixes, whose members share a
 * clinical cross-reactivity concern that the ATC <em>tree</em> cannot express because
 * the members sit in different branches (the ADR Decision 24 boundary — aspirin
 * {@code N02BA01} vs ibuprofen {@code M01AE01}, both NSAIDs).
 *
 * <p>Groups are data, not code: they are loaded independently of the entry source
 * ({@link JsonDrugReferenceSource} or {@link AtcDrugReferenceSource}) so class-family
 * reasoning works with either. A drug belongs to a group when any of its normalized
 * ATC codes starts with any of the group's normalized prefixes — prefixes may be any
 * ATC level, so a deployment chooses the breadth of each family.
