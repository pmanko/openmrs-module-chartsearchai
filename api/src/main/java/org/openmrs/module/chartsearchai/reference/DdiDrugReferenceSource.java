/**
 * {@link DrugReferenceSource} backed by the DDInter 2.0 drug-drug interaction knowledge
 * base ({@code ddi-knowledge-base.json} from the openmrs-ddi-knowledge-base data project):
 * structured DDIs with severity and a mechanism description, normalized to RxNorm and
 * cross-walked to CIEL. Selected by {@code sourceFormat=ddinter}. See ADR Decision 24.
 *
 * <p>The dataset is <em>normalized</em> — three tables joined by id, so nothing is
 * duplicated:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code mechanisms}: {@code {groupId: {text, categories}}}, each description stored once;</li>
 *   <li>{@code drugs}: {@code {id, name, rxcui, rxnorm_name, drugbank_id, atc[], ciel[]}};</li>
 *   <li>{@code interactions}: rows {@code [drug_a_id, drug_b_id, severity, group_id]}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * This source expands that into the module's drug-centric {@link DrugReference} model: one
 * entry per drug, whose {@code interactions[]} are its partners with a {@code severity + mechanism}
 * note. Because the interaction rows are symmetric, each pair contributes to both drugs'
 * entries, which is what the validator's from-either-side matching expects.
 *
 * <p>One class of row is deliberately NOT expanded: a row pairing a drug with itself, or with another
 * row of the same substance — see {@link #isSelfPair} (issues #152, #164).
 *
 * <p>Memory: there are far fewer distinct mechanism descriptions than pairs, so the
 * per-partner notes are interned (one shared {@link String} per {@code severity + group}),
 * bounding note cost to the unique set rather than the pair count.
 *
 * <p>Resolution mirrors {@link JsonDrugReferenceSource}: prefer the operator file at
 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#GP_DRUG_REFERENCE_DATA_FILE_PATH}, else the dataset bundled
 * on the classpath at {@code /chartsearchai/ddi-knowledge-base.json}; any failure degrades
 * to an empty list (fail-safe), so the feature stays an additive net.
 *
 * <p><b>This is the module's DEFAULT source, and the bundled dataset is the WHOLE knowledge base</b>
 * (ADR Decision 36) — 2283 substances, 8234 mechanisms, 295,184 interaction rows, byte-identical to the
 * openmrs-ddi-knowledge-base release it came from, so a refresh is a file copy and its provenance is
 * checkable by hash. It used to be a 16-drug excerpt with the full file left to the operator to download,
 * which meant an install that enabled the feature and configured nothing got four curated drugs. Measured
 * through this parser on the shipped file: 0.6 s to parse cold, ~30 MB retained, 2.1 MB of packed jar.
 * The excerpt survives as a test fixture ({@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.DDI_EXCERPT}) because a case
 * asserting "this record renders exactly these partners" needs a dataset whose partner lists it can
 * state — lisinopril alone has 730 here.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does not carry, the default therefore does not either:</b> no dosing (so
 * {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.warnOnDoseExcess} has nothing to fire on) and no hand-authored
 * allergy/condition rules — see the scope note below, and {@code ShippedDrugReferenceDefaultTest}, which
 * pins the bound rather than leaving it to be discovered.
 *
 * <p><b>Scope.</b> V1 carries drug-drug interactions only: entries expose {@code interactions},
 * never {@code ageBands} or {@code contraindications} (dosing and drug-allergy/condition are
 * out of scope). {@code management} is not a discrete DDInter field, so whatever management prose
 * the mechanism text carries is folded into the interaction note rather than invented — save for
 * the residual field markers below, which are dropped because they carry no management content
 * to fold.
 *
 * <p><b>Residual field markers.</b> Some mechanism texts are prefixed with an all-caps field
 * marker followed by a colon — apparently the surviving tail of a management tag from the
 * monograph the mechanism text was scraped from. Measured over the full 8234-mechanism
 * KB (2026-08-04) there are exactly two: {@code INTERVAL:} (224 mechanisms, 4070 pair rows) and
 * {@code RECOMMENDED:} (50 mechanisms, 1268 pair rows); no other leading {@code TOKEN:} shape
 * occurs, and both markers appear only in that leading position. They are machine artifacts, not
 * prose, and the note reaches three surfaces verbatim — the clinician's chip detail, the rendered
 * reference record, and the pre-answer safety finding that reuses that chip detail
 * ({@link DrugReferenceInjector#renderFinding}) — so {@link #mechanismText} strips a leading
 * marker instead of passing it through (issue #116). Marker <em>shape</em>, not a fixed list of
 * the two seen today: a KB refresh emitting a sibling tag would otherwise leak it verbatim
 * exactly as these two did.
 *
 * <p>The marker is dropped rather than reinterpreted. {@code INTERVAL:} broadly flags
 * administration timing (dose separation is the management for the chelation/absorption rows —
 * 147 of the 224 are {@code categories: [absorption]}), but it is not reliable enough to render
 * as advice: nine of the 224 are {@code synergistic_effect} rows where separating doses is
 * <em>not</em> the management (ibutilide plus a class III antiarrhythmic — additive QT
 * prolongation; flibanserin plus alcohol; mefloquine convulsion risk). The marker itself carries
 * no interval, no separation time and no wording, so any management sentence built from it would
 * be invented, and the mechanism {@code categories} are a PK/PD taxonomy
 * ({@code metabolism}/{@code absorption}/…) that does not encode management either. Structured
 * management guidance therefore has to come from the KB builder keeping the whole upstream tag,
 * not from reverse-engineering its truncated residue here.

	/**
	 * Whether an interaction row joins a drug to ITSELF and so must not be loaded (issue #152). Two
	 * tests, because the KB produces the shape two ways:
	 * <ul>
	 *   <li>the same row on both sides — exactly one in the shipped 19 MB KB, {@code DDInter225}
	 *       (botulinum toxin type A) of 295,184 rows. Its mechanism text is about administering
	 *       different botulinum SEROTYPES together, and the KB files that same mechanism on a genuine
	 *       cross-SUBSTANCE pair of its own — {@code Botulinum toxin type A} against
	 *       {@code Botulinum Toxin Type B}, a different {@code rxnorm_name}, which this guard leaves
	 *       loaded. So the self-pair is an artifact of the KB's granularity that carries no clinical
	 *       content its sibling does not, while what it puts in front of a clinician is
	 *       "Botulinum toxin type A interacts with active order botulinum toxin type A".</li>
	 *   <li>two rows of one substance — 27 more, {@code Lidocaine} against
	 *       {@code Lidocaine (topical)} and the like (measured 2026-08-07 through this parser;
	 *       re-measure before relying on the figures). 25 of the 27 are route/formulation variants; the
	 *       other 2 are rows of one substance whose display names diverge, which the guard only sees
	 *       since issue #164 widened what {@link DrugReference#substanceKey} counts as one substance —
	 *       {@code Daxibotulinumtoxina} against {@code Botulinum toxin type A} (Moderate) and two
	 *       influenza B strain antigens (Minor). Also unrenderable rather than merely redundant: every
	 *       row of a substance
	 *       publishes the same {@code rxnorm_name}, which is the match token a rule carries and the label
	 *       a chip prints, so such a pair can ONLY read as a substance interacting with itself. The
	 *       systemic-plus-topical exposure the KB row is about cannot be stated by anything this module
	 *       renders, while the self-reference can. Every surface that could name such a pair names the
	 *       partner by that shared token wherever nothing reconciled it — which since issue #339 is the
	 *       condition for the screening chip and the drug-in-play chip alike
	 *       ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.partnerLabel}), and for the injected reference record through
	 *       {@code DrugReferenceInjector.orderedInteractionNotes} —
	 *       and the one surface that would print
	 *       the partner's own display label, {@code addQuestionPairInteractions}, already declines a pair
	 *       whose two entries share a name. Since issue #292 a FOLDED drug-in-play chip is a second such
	 *       surface ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.reconciledPartnerName} hands out the entry's display label on
	 *       its entry path), and since issue #297 that record is a THIRD on that same path, where it
	 *       prints the entry's {@code getName()} rather than the token. Neither disturbs the conclusion,
	 *       twice over: this guard drops the rows
	 *       at parse time so no chip is built from them at all, and for a SELF-pair the canonical row's
	 *       display label and the shared token name one substance anyway, so such a pair would still read
	 *       as self-reference. So this guard makes a decision that arm already took, at the
	 *       boundary where it covers every arm.
	 *
	 *       <p>The accepted cost, named rather than left general: two of the 27 are rated Major —
	 *       {@code Bupivacaine} against {@code Bupivacaine (liposome)} and {@code Aminolevulinic acid}
	 *       against {@code Aminolevulinic acid (topical)}, both route variants and both there before
	 *       #164. Those are real product-level warnings, and
	 *       under-warning is the direction this module is otherwise careful about; they are dropped
	 *       because a chip reading "Bupivacaine interacts with active order bupivacaine" is not that
	 *       warning. Stating them needs the route vocabulary that is the data-side half of issue #115.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * Through {@link DrugReference#substanceKey(String, String, String)} rather than a local comparison,
	 * so this guard and the chip grouping mean the same thing by "one substance" — which is why issue
	 * #164 needed no change on the interaction arm at all: widening that key widened this guard with it.
	 * A row publishing no substance
	 * name keys null and is then only caught by the id test — the conservative direction: with no
	 * substance identity to compare, two different ids are two different drugs.
	 *
	 * <p>So the id test is NOT subsumed by the substance one, though nothing in the shipped KB shows it:
	 * every row it catches there also publishes a substance name. For a row publishing none the id
	 * equality is the only test there is, and the {@code substance != null} half is what keeps two such
	 * rows apart rather than collapsing every pair among them. Both are pinned on an authored row —
	 * {@code SelfInteractionTest.aSelfPairSurvivesOnTheIdLegWhenTheRowPublishesNoSubstanceName} and
	 * {@code twoRowsThatBothPublishNoSubstanceNameAreStillTwoDrugs} — because a refresh could introduce
	 * that pairing and no verbatim slice can express it.
	 *
	 * <p>At load rather than in the arms that read the rules: those rows feed five consumers (the
	 * drug-in-play chips, the screening arm, the question-pair arm, the promoted notes inside the
	 * injected reference record, and the pre-answer finding derived from a chip), and one invariant at
	 * the parse boundary covers all of them and any future KB revision. Only this source is guarded — a
	 * hand-authored curated file is the operator's own data, and the {@code atc} adapter carries no
	 * rules at all.

	 *       substance, and every one of them takes that id — including the rows carrying none, which is

	 *   <li>the rows of a substance name that carry <b>two or more</b> get no id at all, and
	 *       {@link DrugReference#substanceKey()} falls back to the display stem exactly as before. The
	 *       whole family falls back together, not just the rows carrying an id: {@code Atropine}
	 *       ({@code DB00572}), {@code Atropine (ophthalmic)} (none) and {@code Hyoscyamine}
	 *       ({@code DB00424}) are one family, and a row-by-row rule would key the first two differently
	 *       and split a route variant off its own substance.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * A name shared by rows that name no DrugBank substance at all is in the first case, keyed on the
	 * substance name itself: the data offers nothing finer, so it is not distinguishing anything, and
	 * that is what merges {@code Thallous Chloride}/{@code Thallous chloride tl-201} and
	 * {@code Typhoid vaccine (live)}/{@code Typhoid vaccine live}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The first case also merges one pair it should not, and the loader says so.</b> A row

	 * {@code rxnorm_name} is merged into the parent on the strength of a claim nothing checked:
	 * {@code Fluoroestradiol f-18} publishes {@code rxnorm_name: estradiol} and no id, so a PET imaging
	 * tracer takes {@code DB00783}. Nothing here can tell that from the two shapes above — a second

	 * repaired here; {@link DrugReferenceValidity#DERIVATIVE_MERGED_WITH_ITS_PARENT_SUBSTANCE} reports
	 * it at load instead, keyed on the relationship the display name states. Issue #196 item 4, and the
