/**
 * Which drug CLASS a question names, when it names one — the vocabulary behind
 * {@link DrugReferenceService#namedDrugClass}, and nothing else (issue #354).
 *
 * <p>It classifies a STRING, not a substance: the answer is a class NAME and never a member set.
 * That boundary is the whole of the issue's design decision and is argued at
 * {@link DrugReferenceService#namedDrugClass}; read it there rather than here.
 *
 * <p><b>Two sources, and each is here because the other cannot serve its case.</b> A class the
 * curated cross-reactivity groups already name is read from THAT data — it is a curated,
 * operator-extensible class-name table with its own load-validity channel
 * ({@code CrossReactivityGroupsLoad.getFindings()}, issue #266), and the shipped seed's one group is
 * named {@code NSAID}, which is one of the two classes this issue reports. The table below carries
 * what that file cannot: a class it does not name at all, and a further SPELLING of one it does.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a class it does not name cannot simply be added to it.</b> A group is not a label. Its
 * {@code atcPrefixes} drive clinical claims — cross-reactivity contraindication chips and
 * duplicate-class-therapy chips, through {@link CrossReactivityGroup#groupsOf} and
 * {@link CrossReactivityGroup#sharedGroup} — so adding a group to make a word recognisable asserts
 * pharmacological cross-reactivity across those prefixes. And for the issue's headline class there
 * is no honest prefix set to add at all; the measurement that establishes it is at
 * {@link DrugReferenceService#namedDrugClass}, and is not repeated here.
 *
 * <p><b>The two sources are independent, and neither is subordinate to the other.</b> Each names the
 * classes it names; the answer is the union. In particular the table below names {@code NSAID}
 * OUTRIGHT rather than as a spelling of the shipped group, and that is a decision with a measured
 * reason: {@code chartsearchai.drugReference.crossReactivityGroupsFilePath} is a supported
 * configuration, so making the class conditional on some loaded group publishing that exact name
 * returned the issue's own {@code an NSAID} case to pre-#354 silence — with nothing logged — on any
 * deployment that curates its own groups file. The groups leg is there to honour a vocabulary an
 * operator has already curated, not to license this one.
 *
 * <p>What the boundary rule forces either way is that a class needs its SPELLINGS enumerated:
 * {@link DrugReference#containsWord}'s prose allowance is zero trailing letters, so {@code NSAIDs} is
 * not the term {@code NSAID}, and a group publishes one {@code name}. A class an operator's file
 * names is therefore recognised in that one spelling; one named here is recognised in as many as are
 * written out.
 *
 * <p><b>What may be admitted, stated so it can be re-applied.</b> A term is admitted only when
 * <ol>
 * <li>it designates a drug CLASS — a pharmacological, chemical or therapeutic grouping — rather than
 * the name of any single substance;</li>
 * <li>it resolves to no entry of the shipped knowledge base, which is a DATA GUARD
 * ({@code DrugClassQuestionNoteTest.everyCuratedClassTermResolvesToNoSubstanceInTheShippedKnowledgeBase},
 * through {@link DrugReferenceService#findImpliedByQuery}) and not a claim made here. It binds BOTH
 * columns: the term is what a question is matched against, and the class name beside it is what the
 * record PRINTS, so the second is guarded by
 * {@code DrugClassQuestionNoteTest.everyClassNameTheTableCanReportNamesNoSubstanceOfTheShippedKnowledgeBase},
 * which drives a question per term through the injector and puts the rendered note back through the
 * same accessor. Guarding the keys alone left the value column unguarded: measured 2026-09-02 with
 * that case deleted, a term whose value is a drug name ships with the whole build green;</li>
 * <li>where a curated cross-reactivity group already publishes the same class, the duplication is
 * DELIBERATE rather than forbidden — see the paragraph above on why {@code NSAID} is named here
 * outright.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Incompleteness is MONOTONE and that is what makes a partial vocabulary safe: an unrecognised class
 * term leaves the module exactly as silent as it is today, while a wrongly admitted one would have
 * the module call a drug a class — which is what (2) exists to prevent.
 *
 * <p><b>Residue, stated rather than claimed away.</b> {@link DrugReference#containsWord} does not
 * collapse whitespace ({@code boundedTokenIndex} is an {@code indexOf} over folded operands), so a
 * question spelling {@code oral  contraceptive} with two spaces, or breaking the phrase across a
 * line, carries no term. That is the same rule every drug alias is matched under, and giving this
 * one its own would be a caller choosing an allowance of its own.
