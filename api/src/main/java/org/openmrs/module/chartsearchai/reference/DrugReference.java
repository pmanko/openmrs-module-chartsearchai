	 * substance cross-reactive, or interacting, with itself. A substance registry can tell them apart
	 * and a display name cannot, so where the reference data supplies one it decides, and the stem is
	 * left to the families it cannot speak for. Widening the substance NAME alone was never the
	 * alternative: it merges the two PPIs.
	 *
	 * <p>Neither half works alone. Where one stem covers two substances the stem alone merges them and
	 * the substance name is what refuses: {@code Varicella Zoster Vaccine (Recombinant)} against
	 * {@code (live/attenuated)} — a distinction that decides whether an immunocompromised patient may
	 * have it at all — and likewise {@code Manganese (chloride)}/{@code (sulfate)},
	 * {@code Dextran (-1)}/{@code (low molecular weight)}, {@code Insulin human}/{@code (isophane)},
	 * {@code Insulin lispro}/{@code (protamine)}, {@code Iron}/{@code (polysaccharide)}. A few more
	 * one-stem groups are kept apart because a row publishes NO substance name rather than a differing
	 * one ({@code Typhoid vaccine (live)}/{@code (inactivated)}) — that is the null-key fallback below,
	 * not this comparison. Together the three reduce those 332 entries to 163 substances (177 while the
	 * stem was the veto), and no resulting group holds two DrugBank substances.

	 *         CONTENT would be the pattern-match-a-label mistake issue #148 undid — so what admits the
	 *         first is only that the data files the family under it. A family filed under a
	 *         route-qualified substance name that ALSO holds a plain row would therefore have its
	 *         presentation elected, which is the shape issues #174 and #187 removed. The shipped dataset
	 *         has exactly one family whose elected row carries a trailing parenthetical while a plain

	 *         {@code SubstanceNameRowTest.everyFamilyElectingAQualifiedRowOverAPlainSiblingIsNamedRatherThanCounted}
	 *         names its members rather than counting them, so a refresh that adds one reddens with the
	 *         offending name.

	 *         Omeprazole} to {@code Esomeprazole}, while nothing here asks anything about the other row.
	 *         Do not conclude from that alone that the cross-family fold is unreachable: what makes it
	 *         unreachable on this dataset is that none of those 4 rows publishes an ATC code, so
	 *         {@code DrugSafetyValidator.entryForAtcCode} never sees one, and
	 *         {@code SubstanceNameRowTest.aRowWhoseTrailingParentheticalIsItsOwnSubstanceNameCarriesNoQualifier}

	 *         MECHANISM PROSE a chip renders. Both consumers asked the same question and got the same
	 *         wrong answer for those 4 rows, which is why issue #250 corrected the predicate rather than
	 *         either call site. Measured over the shipped 19 MB KB (2026-08-07; re-measured 2026-08-13

	 *         predicate and {@link #canonicalRow} over the shipped file on both sides of the correction;
	 *         re-measure before relying on the figures): of the 129 substances filed as more than one
	 *         row, <b>120</b> have such a row and <b>9</b> do not —

	 *         119/10/7 before the correction. WHICH family accounts for a given delta is NOT stated here:
	 *         two copies of that attribution have been written in this repo and both named the wrong

	 * one ATC code being looked up). Shared rather than decided three times, because those surfaces
	 * describe the same substance to the same clinician and to the same model: a chip naming the
	 * substance beside a record naming one of its routes is the chip-versus-prose divergence this module
	 * keeps having to remove.
	 *
	 * <p><b>A fourth caller since issue #353, and it displays nothing</b>:
	 * {@link DrugReferenceService#substancesNamedByBridge} elects the row a substance's claim on a
	 * dictionary bridge's own recorded name is judged by. So this fold decides a NAMING answer there
	 * rather than a rendered name — and keeping the first row instead made that answer, and therefore
	 * whether a finding may state which prescription a substance came from, a fact about the order the
	 * knowledge-base file lists its rows in. That caller's javadoc carries the measurement and what the
	 * election leaves unsettled.
	 *
	 * <p>At the CHIP-SUBJECT site this is the second step rather than the whole answer since issue #194:
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.interactionSubject} asks {@link #nameMatchStrength} first — the row the
	 * patient's own record names is the truthful subject (#187) — and folds only the rows tied on that.
	 * This fold is unchanged and still decides every case where the record names none of them, which is
	 * most of them.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Do not add the recorded-name step here</b> — but not for the reason this used to give. It
	 * said {@code DrugReferenceInjector.matchingEntries} and the class-partner site "have no recorded
	 * name to anchor on", and since issues #237/#259 that is false of the first: {@code matchingEntries}
	 * takes the patient's context and asks {@code interactionSubject} which row this response names each
	 * substance by. The reasons it must still not move are two, and both are stronger than the one they
	 * replace. First, this fold is the tie-break INSIDE {@code interactionSubject}, so a recorded-name
	 * step here would be applied twice at every chip-subject site. Second, {@code matchingEntries} calls
	 * this to choose the row a reference record is RENDERED from, and moving that to the charted row was
	 * measured and declined — the route-unspecified row carries the breadth, and rendering the charted
	 * one loses the patient's own interaction partner in 74 of the shipped KB's 129 multi-row families
	 * against 0 the other way. The injector says which row it rendered instead
	 * ({@code DrugReferenceInjector.rowAttribution}). The class-partner site genuinely still has no
	 * recorded name.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Two rungs since issue #250, in this order.</b> First {@link #namesNoRoute()}: the
	 * route-unspecified row wins wherever the family has one. Then, among rows agreeing on THAT and
	 * belonging to one substance, {@link #namesItsSubstance()}: the row the data files the family under
	 * wins. Otherwise the first row seen keeps the role. The second rung exists because the first one
	 * ties on any family holding two rows that both name no route, and dataset order then answered — so
	 * the shipped KB elected {@code Fluoroestradiol f-18}, a diagnostic PET tracer at index 1282, to
	 * speak for the estradiol substance against {@code Estradiol} at 1927, and every rated partner of
	 * that substance took the tracer as its chip subject. It did not stay in the chip either: live on a
	 * 3.7.1 standalone, a question naming estradiol was answered <em>"No — Fluoroestradiol f-18 should
	 * not be given"</em>, the substance the clinician asked about named nowhere in the response.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The rung ORDER no longer decides anything, and that is issue #250's second half rather than
	 * a lapse.</b> It used to: placing the second rung above the first renamed a fourth shipped family —
	 * the influenza A/Vietnam antigen, whose elected row carried a display name with a dropped leading
	 * "I" — and did so by electing a row {@code namesNoRoute()} called route-qualified while the family
	 * held one it called unqualified, falsifying this method's own first rung. What that argument never
	 * asked is WHY the predicate said that, and the answer was that it was wrong: the parenthetical it
	 * read as a qualifier is part of that row's own {@code substanceName}, character for character. With
	 * {@link #namesNoRoute()} corrected to say so, {@code namesItsSubstance()} IMPLIES
	 * {@code namesNoRoute()}, so the second rung can no longer elect a row the first calls qualified —
	 * on any dataset, not merely this one — and the two placements are indistinguishable. Nothing pins
	 * the order because nothing can; what the order guard protected substantively is pinned instead by
	 * {@code SubstanceNameRowTest.aFamilyWithAnUnqualifiedRowElectsOneAndNoOtherRowSpeaksForIt}, whose
	 * second assertion states the invariant on RAW SYNTAX so that a weakening of either predicate cannot
	 * satisfy it. Mutate {@code namesItsSubstance()} to compare display stems and read the
	 * failures; that mutation elects {@code Salicylic acid (sodium)} for a family holding a plain
	 * {@code Salicylic acid} row. That mutation is not invisible to the suite as a whole — it reddens
	 * many cases — but that FAMILY's election was reached by none of them before the assertion existed.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It guards a weakening of the PREDICATES and nothing else — in particular not a KB
	 * refresh</b>, and that scope is stated because two earlier texts ran the two together. With the
	 * predicates as they stand the raw equality is ENTAILED by the election: a row carrying a trailing
	 * parenthetical is elected over a plain sibling only by answering {@link #namesNoRoute()}, whose
	 * syntactic disjunct is false for it, so {@link #namesItsSubstance()} — the very equality asserted
	 * — holds. Measured rather than left there: a synthetic two-row family appended to the shipped
	 * entries through the real {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource.parse} (a plain {@code Zzprobe} row and a
	 * {@code Zzprobe (ophthalmic)} row whose own {@code substanceName} is that name) reddens
	 * {@code SubstanceNameRowTest.everyFamilyElectingAQualifiedRowOverAPlainSiblingIsNamedRatherThanCounted}
	 * alone and leaves that case green. The named list is the guard a data change reaches; the two
	 * cases cover different mutations rather than ratcheting one another.
	 *
	 * <p>Below the first rung the fold never moves AWAY from {@code namesNoRoute()}, and that is
	 * structural rather than a property of the shipped data: the first rung RETURNS whenever the two rows
	 * disagree on it, so the second is only ever reached between rows that agree, and it therefore cannot
	 * replace an unqualified row with a qualified one. It can still move LATERALLY between two rows that
	 * agree — which is what all three of its shipped moves are — so "monotone" here means the weaker
	 * thing; {@link DrugReferenceInjector#matchingEntries}' bullet says so at its own site. Read that in
	 * the predicate's terms and not the raw string's: since issue #250 an elected row may CARRY a
	 * trailing parenthetical where that parenthetical is its own substance name, which is what the
	 * A/Vietnam family now does.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it moves, measured 2026-08-24 through the real parse and this method on BOTH sides</b> —
	 * the baseline is this same method as it stands before the rung, driven from a second worktree, rather
	 * than a re-expression of it; re-measure before relying on the figures. Of the 129 multi-row families,
	 * <b>3 change subject</b> and 126 do not: {@code Fluoroestradiol f-18}/{@code Estradiol},
	 * {@code Daxibotulinumtoxina}/{@code Botulinum toxin type A}, and the paediatric tick-borne
	 * encephalitis vaccine/the row the data files that family under. All three moves were LATERAL in route
	 * terms, and the count of families electing a route-qualified row was 10 before and 10 after.
	 *
	 * <p><b>That paragraph is a historical measurement and must be read against the PRE-issue-#250
	 * predicate, which is what produced it.</b> Do not carry any of its three claims forward: re-measured
	 * 2026-08-30 against the corrected {@link #namesNoRoute()}, disabling this rung still moves 3 of the
	 * 129 families but a DIFFERENT three — {@code Fluoroestradiol f-18}/{@code Estradiol}, the influenza
	 * A/Vietnam typo row/the row the data files that family under, and
	 * {@code Daxibotulinumtoxina}/{@code Botulinum toxin type A}. The tick-borne family is now decided by
	 * rung ONE and is not a rung-two move at all. The A/Vietnam move is lateral in the PREDICATE's terms
	 * like the other two — rung two is only ever reached between rows that agree on rung one — while over
	 * the RAW strings it replaces a display name carrying no trailing parenthetical with one that does.
	 * That is why a count over the predicate and a count over the string now move in opposite directions;
	 * the paragraph below states both with their units. At the one
	 * {@code canonicalRow} site whose row set is NOT one substance
	 * ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.entryForAtcCode}, over every row publishing one ATC code, 30 of the
	 * KB's 2148 codes spanning more than one substance) exactly 1 fold moves, and within one substance.
	 * The rules the RENDERED record then carries move with the row: the vaccine family gains 19 partners
	 * and loses none, botulinum is identical at 110, and estradiol goes from the tracer's 4 partners to
	 * 578. Those are counts of the elected ROW's rated partners in the dataset and NOT of anything a
	 * clinician sees — the chip arm is scoped to the patient's own active orders, so the response for the
	 * ticket's own patient carries five interaction chips before and after, live-verified. Read 578 as
	 * breadth available to a record, never as chips gained. The estradiol row loses
	 * {@code bazedoxifene} and {@code toremifene}, which only the tracer row rates, and
	 * rendering {@code ospemifene} and {@code tamoxifen} at the substance row's own rating rather than
	 * the tracer's. The CHIP arm is unaffected there, because it pools every row of the substance
	 * ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.bestRulePerPartner}): that pool is 580 partners before and after.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What issue #250's SECOND half moves, measured 2026-08-30 the same way</b> — the real parse of
	 * the shipped KB and this method on both sides of the {@link #namesNoRoute()} correction, the baseline
	 * being that same predicate unmutated; re-measure before relying on the figures. Of the 129 multi-row
	 * families <b>exactly 1 election moves</b>, the influenza A/Vietnam antigen, to the row the data files
	 * it under. <b>State which reading a qualification count is on, because the correction is exactly what
	 * makes the two diverge</b>: elected rows that ANSWER {@code !namesNoRoute()} go 10 → 9, while elected
	 * rows whose raw display name carries a trailing parenthetical go 10 → <b>11</b> — the A/Vietnam row
	 * joins, and its parenthetical is its own substance name. Both are true and they count different
	 * things. At {@code DrugSafetyValidator.entryForAtcCode} <b>0 of 2148</b> folds move, which is
	 * ENTAILED rather than independently observed: none of the 4 rows the correction reaches publishes an
	 * ATC code, so none appears in any code's row set. The RENDERED record for that family moves with the
	 * row, from the typo row's 251 rules to 239 — <b>239 → 228 distinct partners, 12 lost and 1 gained</b>,
	 * 11 of the 12 lost being other vaccines, the twelfth {@code umbralisib} and the gain
	 * {@code trifluridine}. The CHIP arm is unaffected: it pools every row of the substance, and that pool
	 * is <b>240 partners before and after</b>.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The residue of the same-substance gate, stated rather than left to be found.</b> Where the
	 * row set spans substances the second rung is skipped per PAIR, so the answer can depend on the order
	 * the rows arrive in — a row of one substance interposed between two rows of another is compared
	 * against neither of them on that rung. This fold was already order-sensitive there, and the gate
	 * does not make it more so: re-folding each of the 2148 ATC codes' rows reversed, and under 40 random
	 * permutations each, changes the elected row for <b>49</b> codes with this rung and <b>50</b> without
	 * it — the one it removes being {@code G03CA03}, which the rung now decides outright. Nothing here is
	 * a claim that the ordering is sound; what would make it sound is grouping by substance before
	 * folding, and that is a change to {@code DrugSafetyValidator.entryForAtcCode} rather than to this
	 * method.
	 *
	 * @return {@code candidate} where it outranks {@code incumbent} on {@link #namesNoRoute()}, or — for
	 *         two rows of one substance agreeing on that — on {@link #namesItsSubstance()}; else

	 *
	 *         <p><b>And deliberately not gated on a SPACED separator</b>, which is the obvious way to

	 *         KB publishes spaces its separator, while the strain designations and the qualifiers that
	 *         contain one do not. It is refused because such a gate can only ever DROP an ingredient,
	 *         and the KB does publish combinations that join their ingredients bare
	 *         ({@code potassium citrate/potassium gluconate}). Dropping is the one direction this
	 *         widening exists to prevent; the gate above is what handles the other.
	 *
	 *         <p>Nothing pins that choice, and the honest reason is worth recording rather than

	 *         by mutation, 2026-08-09), because the one bare-separator combination the shipped KB names

	 *         the reference data resolves, so that divergence is reached far more often and its cost was
	 *         measured rather than left as a judgement. Applying the #167 veto to the injector's gate as

	 *         {@link #isUnclassifyingAtcCode} held 30 groups; issues #183/#184 took it to 36 and added a
	 *         second, wider predicate, so re-measure it before quoting it for either. Two of the six are the
	 *         noise the veto is for (neomycin beside a ciprofloxacin question, related only through
	 *         "both are also sold as ear drops"); four are pairs a clinician wants — diclofenac beside an

	 *         every subgroup they share is one it vetoes, the class relation they really have being one
	 *         this knowledge base does not otherwise express. That trade is a
	 *         question about the relevance rule and belongs to its own issue, not to #151.

	 * site of application — the codes classify the substance, and two local anaesthetics sharing
	 * {@code N01BB} is exactly the cross-reactivity statement a clinician wants.
	 *
	 * <p>Prefixes, and not an exhaustive partition of ATC: anything unlisted counts as classifying the
	 * substance. Neither direction of error is free, which is why the criterion is ATC's own wording
	 * about a GROUP rather than pharmacological judgement about a substance. A group wrongly listed
	 * here demotes a class that does explain a cross-reactivity concern. A group missing from it does
	 * NOT merely leave the pre-existing answer in place: it becomes the answer as soon as it sorts
	 * ahead of the systemic subgroup the pair also shares, since {@link DrugSafetyValidator}'s scan
	 * takes the first shared subgroup this method does not veto.
	 *
	 * <p>That is how {@code A07A}, {@code B02BC}, {@code B05C} and {@code G02CC} came to be here.
	 * Without them, 46 of the shipped KB's 1090 multi-subgroup ROW pairs named one of the four — among
	 * them ibuprofen/naproxen reading {@code G02CC} instead of {@code M01AE} — and 21 of the 46 had been
	 * moved onto one by this rule itself rather than merely left there (measured 2026-08-06). ROW
	 * pairs: that base and the substance-pair one, and the conversion between them, are defined at
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.sharedClass}, which also carries this 1090's substance-pair
	 * counterpart (issue #243). Over that counterpart the same two counts are <b>19 of the 319
	 * multi-subgroup SUBSTANCE pairs, 2 of them moved</b> (issue #263) — the magnitude in the unit a
	 * chip is raised for, since a chip names a substance and not a row.
	 *
	 * <p>That conversion was re-measured 2026-08-29, and the run reproduced 46 and 21 on the ROW base
	 * before 19 and 2 were quoted: the shipped KB loaded through {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource.load},
	 * the substance base through {@link #substanceGroupKey()} and {@link #canonicalRow}, and the
	 * choice itself through {@code DrugSafetyValidator.sharedClass} with the four prefixes struck out
	 * of the list below, and with the claim filters OFF — the state that method was in when 46 and 21
	 * were taken, since they date from issue #166 ({@code 45c1cc4a}, 2026-08-06) while
	 * {@link #UNCLASSIFYING_ATC_GROUPS} first appears the following day at issue #182
	 * ({@code 078a3d54}). "Moved" means the answer differs from the one the same scan gives with this
	 * whole list emptied: the preference passed over an alphabetically earlier shared subgroup to
	 * reach one of the four, rather than finding it there.
	 *
	 * <p><b>All four of those figures are answers under a configuration of THIS list, so a change to
	 * it is what makes them due again</b> — extending it, trimming it, or moving one of the
	 * {@link #SYSTEMIC_USE_EXCEPTIONS} nested inside it, since {@link #isLocallyAppliedAtcCode} reads
	 * both. That is the shape issue #263 was filed over, one list along, and
	 * {@link #UNCLASSIFYING_ATC_GROUPS}' javadoc invites the change in as many words ("extend that
	 * list and it has to be re-derived against the same index"). {@code LocallyAppliedAtcGroupKeyTest}
	 * reddens when such a change reaches a subgroup the shipped KB publishes; that class's javadoc
	 * says what it leaves uncovered, and it is not the two partition guards in
	 * {@code UnmappedOrderAdministrationSiteTest}, which an edit adding the new group to a site
	 * satisfies. Measured 2026-08-30 by adding {@code A06AD} here and to {@code SITE_GUT} — the
	 * completed edit, the one those guards leave green: 1 of the api suite's 1571 cases red, and it is
	 * that one. PR #331's first review round measured the same edit on head {@code 97445233}, where no
	 * such case existed, taking 46 to 47 and 19 to 20 with the suite green throughout.
	 *

	 * {@value #ATC_SUBGROUP_PREFIX_LENGTH}-character subgroups the matching itself compares.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why a residual bucket is not automatically one of these.</b> ATC files a residue in most of
	 * its groups — a level-4 subgroup whose published name begins "Other" or "Various", meaning
	 * "everything in the group above that is not classified so far". The shipped 19 MB KB uses 97 of
	 * them. But a residue INHERITS whatever the group containing it asserts: {@code R06AX} is "Other
	 * antihistamines for systemic use", and its parent {@code R06A} is "ANTIHISTAMINES FOR SYSTEMIC
	 * USE", so two drugs sharing {@code R06AX} really are both antihistamines and one really is
	 * duplicate therapy for the other. Same for {@code J01GB} "Other aminoglycosides" (already pinned
	 * by {@code CrossReactivityClassChoiceTest}), {@code N06AX} antidepressants, {@code N03AX}
	 * antiepileptics, {@code N02AX} opioids. Vetoing every residue would drop a class claim from
	 * <b>1816 of the KB's 7783 ROW pairs</b> that share a subgroup and <b>1598 of the 5550 SUBSTANCE
	 * pairs</b>; <b>1331 ROW / 1291 SUBSTANCE of those keep it under the 36 groups this list holds
	 * today</b>. The two bases, and the conversion between them, are defined at
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.sharedClass} (issue #243). <b>Those keeps are a set difference of two
	 * runs, not a subtraction of the two counts</b>, because this list's veto is not a subset of a
	 * residue veto: 158 ROW / 143 SUBSTANCE pairs go the other way, dropped here and by no residue at
	 * all, under the non-residue members of this list the re-measurement paragraphs below name. So of
	 * this list's own 643 ROW / 450 SUBSTANCE drop, 485 ROW / 307 SUBSTANCE are inside the residue
	 * counterfactual and the rest is not. That 1331 read 1488 until issue #263, and the 1816 / 1598
	 * read 1974 / 1741 until round 2 of the same issue; the measurement paragraphs further down this
	 * javadoc say why, and how each was taken.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The families, and the reading of ATC's words that puts each here:</b>
	 * <ul>
	 *   <li>a residue inside a group ATC defines by SITE OF APPLICATION — the groups
	 *       {@link #isLocallyAppliedAtcCode} already recognises. {@code A01AD} "Other agents for local
	 *       oral treatment" under {@code A01} "Stomatological preparations" is the whole of what
	 *       acetylsalicylic acid ({@code A01AD05}, a mouth rinse) and epinephrine ({@code A01AD01}, a
	 *       dental haemostatic) have in common, and the chip built on it told a clinician that
	 *       adrenaline duplicates aspirin. Its siblings {@code A01AA}/{@code AB}/{@code AC} name what
	 *       their members ARE (caries prophylactics, antiinfectives, corticosteroids) and are
	 *       deliberately absent — being applied in one place is not a shared property, being a
	 *       corticosteroid is. <b>This family over-reaches, knowingly</b>: the level-3 groups nested
	 *       inside these do not all stop at a site — {@code D06A} is "Antibiotics for topical use",
	 *       {@code D01A} "Antifungals for topical use", {@code S01G} "Decongestants and antiallergics"
	 *       — so their residue does assert something about its members. Telling those groups from the ones that
	 *       assert nothing is a per-group pharmacological judgement, which is what this rule exists to
	 *       avoid making; the cost of not making it is counted below;</li>
	 *   <li>everything under {@code V03A} "ALL OTHER THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS" and under {@code V07A} "ALL
	 *       OTHER NON-THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS" — the only two groups in the index whose own published name
	 *       begins "ALL OTHER", and both are filed directly under {@code V} "VARIOUS", so nothing above
	 *       them names a body system or a property either. Their children partition a residue by the
	 *       accident each product is used for rather than by what it is: {@code V03AB} "Antidotes"
	 *       holds potassium iodide beside acetylcysteine, naloxone and dimercaprol, and reporting two
	 *       of them as cross-reacting states a chemical relationship that does not exist. Written at
	 *       the group rather than per child so a KB refresh cannot add a child that quietly escapes the
	 *       rule;</li>
	 *   <li>{@code S02DC} "Indifferent preparations", under {@code S02D} "OTHER OTOLOGICALS" — a bucket
	 *       ATC fills by exclusion inside a locally applied group, whose published name happens to say
	 *       nothing about its members WITHOUT beginning "Other" or "Various". The name test that
	 *       derives the first family structurally cannot find it, so it is named here instead. WHOCC's
	 *       own name search returns exactly this one row for "indifferent" and nothing at all for
	 *       "miscellaneous", which is the evidence that naming one such bucket is enough. Its sibling
	 *       {@code S02DA} "Analgesics and anesthetics" says what its members are and is deliberately
	 *       absent, the same distinction as {@code A01AD}'s. Not the same case as {@code D09AX} "Soft
	 *       paraffin dressings" or {@code D07XA}–{@code D07XD} "Corticosteroids, …, other combinations",
	 *       also inside {@code D} and also not named "Other …": those name what their members are, so
	 *       they classify and stay out.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p><b>Enumerated, not sampled.</b> The first family is every level-4 subgroup in the WHO ATC index
	 * whose own published name begins "Other"/"Various" AND that falls under
	 * {@link #LOCALLY_APPLIED_ATC_GROUPS} — 27 subgroups, each name read off the WHOCC index itself.
	 * Derived from the index rather than from the defect, which is what makes the list complete rather
	 * than a patch of the two reported cases — the failure mode issue #161's own list hit, where four
	 * missing groups reproduced the defect it had just fixed. The shipped KB uses 20 of the 27, plus 8
	 * of {@code V03A}'s children; {@code S02DC} and {@code V07A} match no shipped-KB entry at all and
	 * are here on the criterion rather than on measured impact, exactly as four of the
	 * {@link #SYSTEMIC_USE_EXCEPTIONS} are — removing {@code S02DC} or {@code V07A} breaks no test,
	 * this KB publishing no subgroup under either, which is why the criterion and not the test suite
	 * has to decide membership. The analogy stops at the criterion: since issue #263 removing one of
	 * those four DOES redden a case, for the reason that list's own javadoc gives. The first family is
	 * complete only WITH RESPECT TO {@link #LOCALLY_APPLIED_ATC_GROUPS}: extend that list and it has to
	 * be re-derived against the same index — and, since issue #263, the figures published on that list
	 * have to be re-taken with it ({@code LocallyAppliedAtcGroupKeyTest}).
	 *
	 * <p><b>The fourth family, added for issue #184: a residue whose ancestry asserts nothing at any
	 * level.</b> The reading above is that a residue inherits its parent's assertion; apply it
	 * recursively and the parent may be a residue too, in which case the walk continues upward and can
	 * reach the top without ever meeting a name that states a property. {@code A16AX} "Various
	 * alimentary tract and metabolism products" sits under {@code A16A} "OTHER ALIMENTARY TRACT AND
	 * METABOLISM PRODUCTS" under {@code A16} (the same words again) under {@code A} "ALIMENTARY TRACT
	 * AND METABOLISM" — an anatomical main group, which by ATC's own level definitions states where the
	 * drug acts and not what it is. Two drugs sharing it are related by nothing. {@code D11AX} is the
	 * tell that this family was already half-caught: it is exactly this shape and was vetoed only
	 * incidentally, because dermatologicals happen to be locally applied.
	 *
	 * <p>Enumerated the same way as the first family — every level-4 subgroup in the WHO ATC index
	 * whose own name begins "Other"/"Various", which contributes no term its ancestors' names do not
	 * already carry, and whose assertion, followed upward through further residues, resolves to nothing
	 * at all or to a bare LEVEL-1 name: ATC's anatomical main group, a body system, which asserts no
	 * shared purpose either. Six are new here — {@code A16AX}, {@code B06AX}, {@code G02CX},
	 * {@code M09AX}, {@code N07XX}, {@code R07AX} — and {@code D11AX}, {@code R03BX}, {@code S01XA} and
	 * {@code V03AX}/{@code V07AY} were already vetoed by the families above.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Level 1 and not level 2, which is where this rule was first drawn and was wrong.</b> ATC's
	 * level 2 is its THERAPEUTIC tier, so a residue inheriting one does assert something — "ANTIBACTERIALS
	 * FOR SYSTEMIC USE" for {@code J01XX}, "ANTINEOPLASTIC AGENTS" for {@code L01XX}, "DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS"
	 * for {@code V04CX}. Two drugs sharing it are not chemically related and ARE duplicate therapy, so
	 * they belong in {@link #PURPOSE_ONLY_ATC_GROUPS} below, not here. Stopping at level 1 instead cost
	 * this list 17 of the 23 members it briefly had, and with them 381 of the 538 duplicate-therapy
	 * claims it would otherwise have withdrawn — among them two erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
	 * ({@code B03XA}) and every pair of systemic antibacterials ATC files as "other" ({@code J01XX}).
	 * Issue #184 reports {@code V04CX} as one of its six; the criterion puts it in the other list, and
	 * the criterion decides.
	 *
	 * <p>The "contributes no term of its own" clause is what stops the walk eating a residue that does
	 * classify: {@code J01DI} "Other cephalosporins and penems" sits under "OTHER BETA-LACTAM
	 * ANTIBACTERIALS" under "ANTIBACTERIALS FOR SYSTEMIC USE" and would otherwise inherit a therapeutic
	 * tier, when its own name names the chemical family that is the whole reason a cephalosporin
	 * allergy says anything about another cephalosporin. Same shape: {@code M03AC} "Other quaternary
	 * ammonium compounds" under "MUSCLE RELAXANTS".
	 *
	 * <p>The family costs real relationships too, and the cost is taken deliberately: {@code G02CX}
	 * bremelanotide × flibanserin, {@code M09AX} onasemnogene × risdiplam and {@code A16AX} miglustat ×
	 * eliglustat are genuine pairs that lose their claim, because no rule over ATC's words can tell
	 * them from eliglustat × givosiran, which is not one. Measured over the shipped KB by driving
	 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate} over each of the 5550 substance pairs the KB relates by a
	 * level-4 subgroup (2026-08-13; re-measure before relying on a figure): these six remove 157 of the
	 * 5271 duplicate-therapy claims, 14 of them for a pair DDInter also rates. Unlike issue #183's
	 * family below, the duplicate-therapy claim goes too — that is the whole difference between
	 * "asserts nothing" and "asserts a purpose".
	 *
	 * <p>Measured over the shipped KB for the 30 groups this list held at issue #182 (2026-08-06,
	 * re-measured independently 2026-08-07; re-measure before relying on a figure): of the 7783 ROW
	 * pairs sharing at least one level-4 subgroup, 486 lose their class claim entirely, 54 keep one and
	 * name a subgroup that does classify the substances instead, and 7243 are untouched. Over the
	 * <em>36</em> groups the list holds today the drop is <b>643 ROW / 450 SUBSTANCE pairs</b> (issue
	 * #263, taken by the re-measurement recorded below; ADR Decision 33 carries the full three-way
	 * split on both bases) — quoted here because it is what the residue counterfactual is differenced
	 * against, and because the arithmetic closes only once its OVERLAP with that counterfactual is
	 * stated: 485 of this 643 are among the 1816 a residue veto drops, so 1816 = 1331 kept here + 485
	 * lost under both, and the remaining 158 are dropped here and by no residue. Over substance pairs,
	 * 307 of this 450, so 1598 = 1291 + 307, the remaining 143 dropped here alone. The 1488 / 1448 the
	 * paragraph above records for the 30-group list is the same difference taken against that list's
	 * 486 / 293, and 158 / 143 are the same pairs there. Attributing each pair to the subgroup the
	 * unvetoed scan chose for it, the largest contributors among those that LOSE the claim are, on
	 * the 30-group split, {@code V03AB} (134 ROW pairs), {@code D11AX} "Other dermatologicals" (115),
	 * {@code S01XA} "Other ophthalmologicals" (99) and {@code D06AX} "Other antibiotics for topical
	 * use" (33); on the 36-group split {@code A16AX} (91) and {@code N07XX} (55) come in fourth and
	 * fifth and push {@code D06AX} to sixth.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Those four 30-group figures read 135/130/99/68 until issue #263, and were not wrong — they
	 * were on an unstated base.</b> Same attribution, wider population: every pair the scan gave that
	 * subgroup, whether the veto went on to cost it its claim or merely to move it. 135 = 134 + 1,
	 * 130 = 115 + 15, 99 = 99 + 0, 68 = 33 + 35, and those moved pairs are the whole of the 54 the
	 * paragraph above states ({@code D06AX} 35, {@code D11AX} 15, {@code D01AE} 3, {@code V03AB} 1).
	 * The missing base is what made the 68 read as a contradiction of the {@code D06AX} 33 the cost
	 * breakdown below states, which counts losses alone — issue #243's pattern, one level down.
	 *
	 * <p><b>That 1331 read 1488 until issue #263, and the reason is worth keeping.</b> 1488 is the
	 * answer over the <em>30</em> groups this list held at issue #182 — the scope the 486/54/7243
	 * triple above states for itself — and issue #184 (PR #241) added six more without re-measuring
	 * it, so a figure whose own wording says "keep it <em>here</em>" came to describe a rule this
	 * class no longer applies. The residue counterfactual beside it did not move, because all six
	 * additions are themselves residues and a blanket residue veto already covered them; that is
	 * exactly why nothing looked wrong, only the surviving half having drifted. The same six moved
	 * the class-claim drop by 157 on BOTH pair bases (486 to 643 ROW, 293 to 450 SUBSTANCE), which is
	 * also the number the claim-base sentence above states for them — three identical deltas on three
	 * bases, and issue #263 did not check whether they count the same pairs.
	 *
	 * <p>The re-measurement, 2026-08-29, retaken in round 2 of the same issue on head
	 * {@code 3084cd80}: the shipped KB loaded through {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource.load}, the
	 * substance base from {@link #substanceGroupKey()} and {@link #canonicalRow}, the choice from
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.sharedClass} reached by reflection and never re-expressed. Each veto
	 * configuration is one dump of every pair sharing a level-4 subgroup with the answer of that
	 * method beside it, so a counterfactual is a DIFF of two dumps line for line rather than a
	 * recomputation. The round-2 run reproduced the 7783 / 5550 pair bases and the unmutated 643 / 450
	 * byte for byte against the first run's dumps before anything was re-quoted. The residue set is
	 * the <b>98</b> of the 594 level-4 subgroups {@link #atcSubgroups()} yields over this KB whose WHO
	 * ATC/DDD published name begins "Other"/"Various", the names read off the WHO index snapshot of
	 * 2026-04-25. It is counted over the same population as the 97 this javadoc records and is one
	 * more than that 97; neither pass held the snapshot the 97 was read from, so the discrepancy is
	 * recorded rather than resolved. Restricting the 98 to {@link #LOCALLY_APPLIED_ATC_GROUPS} gives
	 * the same 20 the "shipped KB uses 20 of the 27" sentence records.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The counterfactual read 1974 ROW / 1741 SUBSTANCE for one round, and the base is why.</b>
	 * Those are the drop under the 98 residues UNIONED with this list's own 36 members — a veto nobody
	 * proposes, and not the "vetoing every residue" the sentence publishing them describes. The union
	 * was taken because under it this list's drop is a subset of the counterfactual's, so 1974 minus
	 * 643 closes as a subtraction. Vetoing exactly the 98 does not close that way and gives
	 * <b>1816 ROW / 1598 SUBSTANCE</b>. The 158 ROW / 143 SUBSTANCE gap between the two readings is
	 * carried by the seven of the 34 subgroups this list refuses over the shipped KB that are not
	 * residues at all — {@code V03AB} (134 ROW / 119 SUBSTANCE pairs), {@code V03AF} (15 / 15),
	 * {@code V03AE} (6 / 6) and {@code V03AC} (3 / 3), attributed by the subgroup the residue-only run
	 * chose for each pair; {@code V03AH}, {@code V03AN} and {@code V03AZ} are the other three and
	 * carry none.
	 * What did NOT move is the KEPT counts, on this KB: 1331 ROW / 1291 SUBSTANCE against the 36 and
	 * 1488 / 1448 against the 30 come out identical under both vetoes, pair for pair, because a set
	 * difference is what they always were.
	 *
	 * <p>{@code UnclassifyingAtcVetoSetTest} now reddens when a change to this list reaches a subgroup
	 * the shipped KB publishes, which is less than "whenever this list moves"; that class's javadoc
	 * says what it leaves uncovered.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What that costs, counted rather than rounded down</b> — over that same 30-group 486, not
	 * the 643. 116 of the 486 name a subgroup whose own published name states a therapy or an
	 * indication, so the claim they lose was defensible:
	 * {@code D06AX} 33, {@code D05AX} 26, {@code D01AE} 25, {@code S01GX} 12, {@code V03AE} 6,
	 * {@code D10AX} 5, {@code V03AC} 3, {@code G01AX} 3, {@code S01AX} 2, {@code M02AX} 1. Concretely:
	 * calcipotriol and calcitriol are both topical vitamin-D analogues and share only {@code D05AX};
	 * azelastine and cetirizine are both H1 antihistamines and share only {@code S01GX}; the iron
	 * chelators ({@code V03AC}) and the potassium/phosphate binders ({@code V03AE}) do share a mechanism
	 * and lose the claim with the rest of {@code V03A}. 451 of the 486 carry no DDInter rating either,
	 * so for those the class chip was the only chip. The price is paid deliberately: the alternative is
	 * the per-group or per-child judgement named above, and what this module does have instead is the
	 * curated cross-reactivity groups, which every vetoed pair still falls through to.

	 * {@code S01AA} "Antibiotics" and {@code J04AB} "Antibiotics" name an organism to kill, while
	 * {@code R06AX} "Other antihistamines" names a receptor, {@code N06DA} "Anticholinesterases" an
	 * enzyme and {@code C01BD} "Antiarrhythmics, class III" a channel — those three are classes and
	 * stay out. {@code N01B} "Anesthetics, local" and its {@code S01HA}/{@code C05AD}/{@code R02AD}
	 * counterparts stay out for the same reason, which is the reading
	 * {@link #LOCALLY_APPLIED_ATC_GROUPS} already records for {@code N01B}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Enumerated from the index, not from the reported cases.</b> Every level-4 subgroup in the

	 * than from the three subgroups issue #183 names is the point: issue #161's list was hand-picked
	 * and its hardening found it incomplete in a way that reproduced the defect it was fixing.
	 * {@code S01AA}, {@code A07AA} and {@code S02AA} are here because the criterion reaches them, not
	 * because they were reported.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why this is a per-ARM rule and not another veto.</b> The alternative put to this work was
	 * that ATC classifies purpose and route rather than chemistry, so it should license duplicate
	 * therapy only and cross-reactivity should come from the curated groups alone. Measured over the
	 * shipped 19 MB KB by driving {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate} over each of the 5550 substance
	 * pairs the KB relates by a level-4 subgroup (2026-08-13; re-measure before relying on a figure):
	 * the blanket rule removes all 5266 cross-reactivity claims, of which 3701 rest on a subgroup that
	 * does name chemistry or a molecular target — the penicillins, the cephalosporins, the
	 * aminoglycosides, the benzodiazepines, the statins — and 1565 on purpose or on nothing, while the
	 * one cross-reactivity group the module ships replaces 24 of the 5266. It loses real signal at 2.4
	 * times the rate it removes false claims, so it is not what shipped. This list and the one above
	 * remove the 1565 between them, keep the 3701, and rename 4; 586 of the 1565 are for a pair
	 * DDInter also rates, so for those the interaction chip survives and only the class claim goes.
	 * The largest contributors are {@code L01XX} "Other antineoplastic agents" (276 claims),
	 * {@code N06AX} "Other antidepressants" (132), {@code S01AA} "Antibiotics" (118), {@code N03AX}

	 *         shape, and the cost of that is recorded on
	 *         {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder.addDrugName}.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Why this exists (issue #147).</b> Such a string reached {@link #matchesText}
	 *         by default, and the prose rule's symmetric boundary is wrong for it: a localized
	 *         dictionary suffixes the INN stem with one inflectional ending, so an allergy recorded as
	 *         {@code Clarithromycine} resolved to no entry at all while the SAME string as an order
	 *         name resolved fine — {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasActiveDrug} having been given
	 *         {@link #matchesOrderName} for exactly that reason (issue #86). A patient on
	 *         {@code Clarithromycine Co 500mg} was therefore told that simvastatin "interacts with
	 *         active order clarithromycin — Major" while their own recorded allergy to that drug
	 *         produced nothing: two matchers with different tolerance on the two halves of one safety
	 *         check.
	 *
	 *         <p>So this borrows {@code matchesOrderName}'s rule rather than introducing a third —
	 *         an allergen name and an order name are the same shape, one localized display name out of
	 *         the same dictionary, and the measurement behind that rule's tail allowance is recorded
	 *         there. What it must NOT be is a relaxation of {@code matchesText} itself: that serves
	 *         prose, where #86 measured the symmetric boundary as correct ("advil" must not match
	 *         inside a longer word), so the fix is to give this shape a matcher deliberately rather
	 *         than to make one rule serve three.

	 * picks a substance's representative row for DISPLAY, while this picks which row the chart's own
	 * string is about, and applying it here would rename a charted {@code Ketorolac (ophthalmic)}

	 *
	 * <p>The two do COMPOSE at one site, in that order and only there: since issue #194
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.interactionSubject} asks this first and folds only the rows that tie,

	 *   this matcher, folded (#129)       907     0 of 9   (0 of 12 accented)     10 of 10
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * <p>That 2531 x 2093 product is a (NAME, TOKEN) population of its own, and neither of the ATC
	 * pair bases {@code DrugSafetyValidator.sharedClass} defines — issue #263, which labels the 78
	 * below on it and did not re-derive the unit of the {@code matches} column itself, the corpus
	 * behind that column being a dictionary this repo does not carry.
	 *
	 * <p>224 of the 2531 names carry a diacritic. Folding both operands makes the change a pure
	 * relaxation — 78 (NAME, TOKEN) pairs added over the 2531 x 2093 product, <em>0 removed</em> —
	 * which is what let this widening be scored against #128's kill set instead of argued about, and

	 * {@code nitroglycérine} folds to {@code nitroglycerine}, i.e. {@code glycerin} plus one
	 * inflectional letter, so it becomes a candidate for that token at the very moment
	 * {@code glycérine} legitimately does, and only the LEFT boundary separates them.
	 *
	 * <p>76 of the 78 are an accented spelling of the token's own drug ({@code héparine} ~ heparin,
	 * {@code lévofloxacine} ~ levofloxacin, {@code énoxaparine} ~ enoxaparin). The other two, for the
	 * record, are both the PHRASE nesting no boundary rule can see rather than a new class of error:
	 * {@code preparado de activador del plasminógeno tipo tisular} (tissue plasminogen ACTIVATOR)
	 * matches {@code plasminogen}, that token's only match in this dictionary, inheriting
	 * bleeding-risk rules that fit a fibrinolytic anyway; and
	 * {@code acétaminophene,pseudo-éphédrine,…} matches {@code ephedrine} across the hyphen, which its
	 * English twin row {@code Acetaminophen,Pseudo-ephedrine,…} already did before this change — so
	 * the fold makes one product's two spellings agree rather than introducing that imprecision.
	 * Both are a mislabel of a drug the patient IS on, like the {@code glycerin} case above.
	 *
	 * <p>Misspellings are deliberately NOT accommodated. {@code Lisoniazide} and
	 * {@code Sprironolactone} are typo'd rows in this same dictionary; folding leaves both unmatched
	 * (measured before and after), and it must stay that way — matching a typo means matching a name

	 * Whether {@code text} carries {@code token} under the boundary rule: the boolean view of
	 * {@link #boundedTokenIndex}, which is the one scan. Its sharers reach it three ways and the rule
	 * therefore cannot drift between them: through here, where the operands still need folding
	 * ({@link #containsWord} and {@link #matchesOrderName}); through {@link #foldedWordMatch} and
	 * {@link #foldedOrderNameMatch}, the same two rules for operands a caller folded once where they
	 * were produced (issue #330); and through {@link #wordIndex} for {@link #namedOccurrences}, which
	 * since issue #260 needs the POSITION rather than the answer. Every one of those routes takes its
	 * allowance from the same constant as the rule it is, which is what keeps them one rule apiece.
	 * <b>"The one scan" is scoped to those sharers and not to the module.</b> Since issue #337
	 * {@code ChartSearchAiUtils.statesWord} answers a boundary question of its own, over the closed
	 * rating vocabulary rather than over drug names. At {@code PROSE_TRAILING_LETTERS} the two
	 * conditions are the same one, measured; what separates them is that this family folds
	 * diacritics and that one deliberately does not, and that {@link #containsWord} is
	 * package-private here. It is deliberately not a fourth route into this scan and must not become
	 * one, but a change to the boundary definition here does not reach it, so consider both.
	 * A match needs {@code token} to start at a word boundary in {@code text} and to end at
	 * one, give or take up to {@code maxTrailingLetters} letters. Letters only: a digit is never an
	 * inflection, so a digit sitting against the token is neither stepped over nor treated as the
	 * end of the name, and a display name that glues its strength straight onto the drug name
	 * ({@code Aspirin81mg}) therefore does not match. That shape does not occur in the measured
	 * dictionary — of the 67 matches this rule drops relative to bare containment, 61 are a token
	 * inside a longer word and 6 are tails longer than two letters, none is a glued digit — and
	 * treating a digit as the end of the name instead scores identically over that corpus (829
	 * either way), so the two are indistinguishable on real data and this is the conservative one.
	 * Case-insensitive; a null or empty token never matches. Whitespace-only is the caller's
	 * business, deliberately not this method's: {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasActiveDrug} trims its
	 * token, and since issue #150 EVERY format's load drops an alias that names nothing —
	 * {@link DrugReferenceValidity#checkEntries} runs {@code sanitizeAliases} on the parsed entries
	 * whatever parsed them, so such a token no longer reaches this scan from a loaded dataset. (This
	 * paragraph used to say a hand-authored {@code json} KB was unsanitized and that the guard belonged
	 * in that parser. Both were true before #150 and neither is now: the guard is one shared load-time
	 * rule, which is the arrangement CLAUDE.md's validity bullet requires.) It still matters that the
	 * scan itself would match one, because the {@code setEntries} seam bypasses the load — and it is
	 * wider under the tail allowance than under the symmetric rule, so #147 giving allergens the tail
	 * allowance widened it.
	 *
	 * <p>Diacritic-insensitive on BOTH sides (issue #129), which is why the fold lives here rather
	 * than in either named matcher: the same accented order name reaches both of them — as the
	 * haystack when a rule token is matched against it ({@link #matchesOrderName}) and as the
	 * haystack again when the order-driven arms resolve that order's own reference entry
	 * ({@link DrugReferenceService#findForActiveOrders} → {@code findImpliedByDrugName} →
	 * {@code findByDrugName} → {@link #matchesDrugName}, which is this rule again since issue #147),
	 * and as the NEEDLE when an order name is looked for in a rendered record
	 * ({@code PatientClinicalContext.ActiveDrugOrder.namedIn}). Folding one matcher would leave the
	 * same patient half-checked; folding one SIDE would break that third case, whose needle is the
	 * patient's accented name. Folding both operands also makes the change a pure relaxation —
	 * everything that matched before still matches — which is what let the widening be measured
	 * against #128's kill set rather than argued about.
	 *
	 * <p>Folding the reference side is a no-op on every shipped dataset and is not there for gain:
	 * measured over the full DDInter KB, 0 of its 2093 rule tokens and 0 of its 5169 aliases carry a
	 * combining mark, and no two tokens fold together. It is there because a hand-authored
	 * {@code json} KB may carry an accented alias, and a one-sided fold would then silently stop
	 * matching the accented order name it was written for.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Some callers fold for themselves, and that is deliberate rather than a second copy of the
	 * rule</b> — every one of them goes through {@link #foldedLower}, so there is still exactly one
	 * expression of what this scan's operands must be. Since issue #260 {@link #namedOccurrences}
	 * takes its haystack already folded, because it returns a POSITION and the fold is not
	 * length-preserving. Since issue #330 an entry's own aliases are folded once in
	 * {@link #setAliases} and a scan's recorded name once in a {@link FoldedName}, because each is
	 * fixed while the loop that compares it runs: folding at THIS level meant deriving both operands
	 * again for every alias of every entry, measured at 1,420,480 {@link #foldedLower} calls in a
