/**
 * Part 1 of the drug-reference feature: injects matching {@link DrugReference}
 * entries into the serialized chart as additional numbered records the LLM can
 * cite, so it can ground reference facts (dosing, prose warnings,
 * contraindications, interactions) the same way it grounds chart records.
 *
 * <p>Injection is appended <em>after</em> the retrieved chart records, continuing
 * the citation numbering. A {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_DRUG_REFERENCE} record
 * carries that resource type so the frontend can render its citation chip distinctly (a side
 * panel, not a chart-tab navigation). That is NOT true of every injected type — an
 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_ACTIVE_DRUG_ORDER} record is deliberately the
 * opposite, carrying the patient's real {@code Order} uuid precisely so a client CAN navigate to
 * it like any other chart citation (see below).
 *
 * <p>Since issue #354 one injected kind stands for no record at ALL — a
 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_DRUG_CLASS_NOTE} reports that the QUESTION named a
 * drug class no ENTRY of this dataset is indexed by, so there is nothing for a client to navigate to
 * and its
 * {@code resourceUuid} names the class rather than a row. That field is LOAD-BEARING and not merely
 * a label: {@link org.openmrs.module.chartsearchai.ChartSearchAiUtils#unresolvedDrugClass} reads the
 * response's own {@code unresolvedDrugClass} statement out of it, so writing anything but the bare
 * class name there changes what a client is told. It is raised only where the question resolved no
 * substance, so it never appears beside a {@code drug_reference} record.
 *
 * <p><strong>Adding another kind of injected record?</strong> Its resource type must also be
 * classified by {@link org.openmrs.module.chartsearchai.ChartSearchAiUtils#referenceGroup}, which
 * decides whether a client presents a citation as evidence about the patient or as module-supplied
 * reference material. That method fails safe to <em>chart evidence</em> for types it does not
 * recognise — the wrong default for module-supplied material — so an unclassified injected type is
 * published to clinicians as if it came from the patient's own record, with no error raised. The
 * reflective guard in {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroupTest} catches a new
 * {@code RESOURCE_TYPE_*} constant, but it cannot see a bare string literal written here.
 *
 * <p>That one classification also decides whether the citation can be grounding-verified (issue
 * #122): reference material is demote-only, so its verdict is never {@code true}, while chart
 * evidence is graded normally so far as PROVENANCE decides it. Two further axes this classification
 * does not reach each leave a chart-evidence citation ungraded all the same: who made the CLAIM (a
 * citation the MODULE attached, issue #305, drawn by ADR Decision 80 rather than by this javadoc),
 * and whether the RECORD names the drug of the order it is about — the stamp this class writes onto
 * its own {@code active_drug_order} mapping, ADR Decision 93. Both
 * consequences of the classification follow from the single provenance judgement and
 * both are asserted by that guard — they used to be two separate registrations, and the second was
 * missed when {@code safety_finding} was added. Since issue #201 it decides a third thing: a
 * reference-group citation publishes no verdict at all, serializing {@code grounded: null} however
 * it was graded. So classifying a new injected type as reference material silently removes its
 * citations from the grounding signal a client sees — which is correct for module-supplied prose
 * and wrong for the patient's own record, and is one more reason to decide on provenance rather
 * than on "the module injected it". Since issue #229 it also decides prompt COST: the record and
 * character totals {@code ChartSearchAiUtils.referenceSlice} measures, and the audit row carries,
 * are the reference-group ones — so classifying a new injected type here also puts it into the
 * figure an operator reads as this module's share of the context window.
 *
 * <p>The kinds injected today are not all module-supplied: a {@code drug_reference} entry, a
 * {@code safety_finding} and, since issue #354, a {@code drug_class_note} present as reference
 * material, while an {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#RESOURCE_TYPE_ACTIVE_DRUG_ORDER} record is the
 * patient's own active order (read from {@code OrderService} when the chart cannot substantiate it —
 * see {@link #unrepresentedActiveOrders}) and so deliberately presents as chart evidence. For that
 * one the fail-safe default happens to be the correct classification; the decision is recorded
 * explicitly in the guard test rather than left to the default. Read the list off that guard's own
 * recorded decisions rather than off this sentence, which is prose and can go stale.
 *
 * <p>Matching is deterministic and age-gated:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Question-driven</b> — an alias hit against the query text.</li>
 *   <li><b>Patient-driven</b> — the reference entries the patient's active orders resolve to, which
 *       since issue #151 is whatever {@code DrugReferenceService.findForActiveOrders} answers (an ATC
 *       code hit OR any name the order carries — its coded drug's, the free text a clinician typed,
 *       or its concept's) rather than the ATC hit alone, so this layer and
 *       {@link DrugSafetyValidator} cannot disagree about which orders the patient has.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Numeric dosing is rendered only when an age band matches the patient's age, so
 * a pediatric maximum is never surfaced for an adult query; contraindication and
 * interaction facts (which are not age-specific) are still rendered.

	 * every interaction off the entry, so nothing is lost from safety checking. How many the record
	 * does not name is reported on the {@link RecordMapping} as a field — never as a text tail, which
	 * the model recited into answers (issue #117). Note that this budget is not the only reason a
	 * partner goes unnamed, nor usually the main one: the last segment of {@code render} represents the
	 * whole dataset tail with a single partner whenever anything patient-specific was shown, and with at
	 * most {@link #MAX_TAIL_PARTNERS_WHEN_NOTHING_PATIENT_SPECIFIC} of them when nothing was, so most of
	 * that count is normally "not relevant to this patient" rather than "did not fit".
	 *
	 * <p>Two guarantees override the budget, so the rendered length is the cap plus a bounded
	 * overshoot rather than a hard ceiling — see {@code render}: every partner the patient is
	 * actually on is represented, and the dataset tail renders alongside them in the compact
	 * {@code name (Severity)} form — one partner where anything patient-specific was shown, up to
	 * {@link #MAX_TAIL_PARTNERS_WHEN_NOTHING_PATIENT_SPECIFIC} where nothing was (issue #355). Breadth
	 * is all the tail is there for either way.
	 * <b>Represented is not the same as rendered in full</b>, and the two segments that represent her
	 * own partners differ in how: a PROMOTED note takes its full text while the budget allows and the
	 * compact {@code name (Severity)} form when it will not fit, while a note the floor filtered takes
	 * its full text only if it is the first of its segment (issue #357 — the rest state the rating
	 * alone, because at the shipped floor they would otherwise all state one sentence).
	 *
	 * <p><b>Per record, and nothing bounds how many records there are.</b> N records cost N times
	 * this. That is a deliberate standing decision rather than an omission — issue #229 asked for a
	 * cap in the shape of {@code maxPairChips} and it was declined; ADR Decision 57 is canonical for
	 * the measurement and the argument, and is not restated here. What replaces it is a durable
	 * observable: {@code ChartSearchAiUtils.referenceSlice} measures the assembled chart and the

	/**
	 * How many dataset-tail partners the record NAMES when nothing patient-specific was shown — when no

	 * condition issue #357 put in place of "nothing promoted", and this is the arrangement that issue
	 * left to issue #355 (see {@link #renderTier} for the partition and CLAUDE.md for the division).
	 *
	 * <p><b>A note on the provenance labels below and in this change's other measurements.</b> Where one
	 * names {@code origin/main at 85da86fb}, that is the tree it was TAKEN on — issue #357's fix, the
	 * base this change was re-based onto. {@code origin/main} has advanced since (issue #354's fix,

	 * neither {@code render}'s interaction segments nor {@code orderedInteractionNotes}. Re-measure
	 * rather than trusting that where a later base touches either.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Issue #355.</b> Until it, that case spent the whole {@link #MAX_INTERACTION_RENDER_CHARS}
	 * budget on FULL mechanism paragraphs for whichever partners sat at the head of the entry's
	 * dataset order, on the rationale that with nothing patient-specific "the general material IS its
	 * content". Measured live on the 3.7.1 standalone (2026-09-01, full 19 MB KB): a patient on three
	 * ARVs asked "Can I give this patient Metformin for diabetes?" and got a 1512-character Metformin
	 * record that was nothing but mechanism prose about ketoconazole, ketoprofen, ketorolac,
	 * ketotifen and labetalol — the head of that entry's partner list, an alphabetical accident —
	 * which the model recited. The question was patient-specific; what the record answered with was
	 * dataset position. The mechanism text is the actionable half only for a partner the patient is
	 * actually on, and issue #117 records this model garbling long verbatim copies while reciting
	 * them, so every irrelevant paragraph offered is a paragraph of mangled clinical prose a
	 * clinician may be shown.
	 *
	 * <p><b>That live chart no longer reaches this branch, and the defect it showed is still live on
	 * one that does.</b> Re-measured 2026-09-02 through the real {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource.parse}
	 * of the shipped knowledge base and the real {@code injectRecords} on {@code origin/main} at
	 * {@code 85da86fb}: DDInter files all three ARVs as {@code Unknown}-rated partners of Metformin, so
	 * since issue #357 they are the chart-named segment, {@code tailStart} is 3, and that record is 215
	 * characters. The reproduction above stands as the record of what was seen; what closes that
	 * particular chart is #357. The defect this constant addresses is what remains: a chart naming NO
	 * partner of the entry, which is the ordinary case, since a question about a drug the patient is not
	 * on is the ordinary question. Its witness, measured the same day through the real
	 * {@code injectRecords} over the bundled 16-drug DDInter excerpt for a patient on no active order
	 * asking about Ibuprofen: 1432 characters on {@code origin/main}, two full mechanism paragraphs
	 * about lisinopril and metformin, neither of them hers, against 193 characters naming five partners
	 * on this head.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why a handful rather than the ONE the other branch renders.</b> There, a patient-specific
	 * segment has already carried the patient-specific content and the tail only has to say that
	 * others exist.
	 * Here the tail IS the record, and a single name reads as this drug's only interaction — which is
	 * what the test replaced by issue #355 warned the obvious simplification would do to every entry
	 * the patient has no overlap with, the common case. The value is a judgement and not a
	 * measurement: enough that the section reads as an open list, few enough that the tail costs on
	 * the order of a hundred characters against the 1500 this branch used to spend.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What the suite does and does not decide about it</b> (re-measured 2026-09-02 on the tree
	 * that merges issue #357's three-segment partition, by mutating this line and running
	 * {@code mvn -o clean install} from the repository root, from clean, once per value). At 1 and at 2
	 * the suite reddens — the entry-stripping argument above, made concrete. At 3, 4, 5 and 6 it is
	 * green. So the lowest value the suite admits is 3, it does not distinguish 3 from 5, and no case
	 * bounds it from above at 5 either: do not read 5 as pinned. An earlier wording of this paragraph
	 * put the bound "somewhere under 3", inferred from the one value between 1 and 3 that it had not
	 * run.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Mutate the line and read the failures; do not trust a list of them.</b> An earlier version
	 * of this paragraph enumerated the cases, and the enumeration went stale inside this very change —
	 * giving {@link #SEVERITY_DESCENDING} its naming key moved a nameless rule to the back of the
	 * tail, so a case that reddened at 1 before the key stopped reddening after it, while the comment
	 * still named it.
	 *
	 * <p>A COUNT and not a budget, because the budget is still applied beside it: see {@code render}
	 * for why both are needed.
	 *
	 * <p><b>A consequence outside this class, measured and not closed.</b> The compact form fits MORE
	 * partner names into a much smaller record — re-measured 2026-09-02 through the real
	 * {@code injectRecords} over the bundled 16-drug DDInter excerpt, for a patient on no active order
	 * asking about Ibuprofen: the record names 2 partners in 1432 characters on {@code origin/main} at
	 * {@code 85da86fb} and 5 in 193 on this head, with {@code withheldInteractions} 13 and 10 — and
	 * every name in a record this module INJECTED is part
	 * of the corpus {@code DrugSafetyValidator.isEchoOfAttributableRecord} treats as something the
	 * model may merely have repeated back (issue #105). <b>That corpus is not citation-gated</b>:
	 * since issue #360 it is every recitable reference record in the chart whether the answer cited it
	 * or not ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.isRecitableReferenceMaterial}), so the widening recorded here
	 * reaches an uncited answer too. So a mention that used to be read as a proposal can now be read
	 * as an echo, and <b>this change is what silences it, on the CITED answer and on the uncited one
	 * alike.</b> Measured 2026-09-02 through the real {@code injectRecords} and the real
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.validate}, with the real bundled cross-reactivity groups, over that
	 * excerpt: a patient allergic to warfarin and on no active order asked "Can she take ibuprofen?"
	 * raises a recorded-allergy contraindication chip on the merge base and none on this head — and
	 * the two answer shapes, "Ibuprofen interacts with warfarin [2]" and the same sentence without the
	 * bracket, move together in both trees — chip raised in both shapes on {@code origin/main} at
	 * {@code 85da86fb}, in neither on this head. What moved is which partners the record names: the
	 * base's record names lisinopril and metformin, this head's names methotrexate, warfarin, aspirin,
	 * lisinopril and metformin. Issue #360 is why
	 * the BRACKET no longer makes a difference — it is what stopped that corpus being citation-gated,
	 * two sentences above — and it is not why the chip is gone; an earlier wording of this paragraph
	 * attributed the uncited half to it, which would tell a reader that half was settled upstream and
	 * needed no checking here. That is issue #105's contract rather than a gap opened here, and it IS
	 * pinned —
	 * {@code ActiveOrderContraindicationTest.aRecitedPartnerThePatientIsNotTakingGainsNoContraindicationCheck}
	 * asserts exactly that shape, a drug the patient is allergic to but not taking, recited out of an
	 * injected record, raising no chip. What issue #355 changes is only which drugs the record names,
	 * so the contract reaches more of them. Recorded because the widening is this change's; issue #360
	 * is closed and its fix is on main, so this is a settled contract rather than a deferral — do not
	 * read it as an unpinned loss.
	 *
	 * <p>One more consequence for a reader of the audit table: {@code reference_slice_chars} falls
	 * sharply for a record with nothing patient-specific to show, so rows either side of this change are
	 * not comparable in that column.
	 *
	 * <p><b>A pre-existing naming collision (issue #196) that issue #355's own verify table read as
	 * closed by this constant, and is not — recorded here, not fixed.</b> The shipped
	 * KB files two different DrugBank substances, {@code Ketoconazole} and {@code Levoketoconazole},
	 * under one {@code rxnorm_name} ({@code ketoconazole}) — one of the families
	 * {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource.substanceIds} withholds a substance id for, because more than one
	 * DrugBank id shares the name; that method's javadoc carries the measurement over the shipped KB. {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource} builds each row's match
	 * token from that shared {@code rxnorm_name}, so {@code DrugSafetyValidator.partnerLabel} names
	 * both rows alike and {@code DrugReferenceInjector.onePerPartner} folds them onto whichever is
	 * rated more severely — repairing that is issue #196's, and neither {@code partnerLabel} nor
	 * {@code onePerPartner} nor {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource} was touched to record this.
	 *
	 * <p>Issue #355's own verify-table row (d) called that collision "fixed absent" on Metformin, on the
	 * reasoning that DDInter rates the fold's survivor Moderate and five Major partners sit ahead of it,
	 * so a severity-descending capped tail would drop it. <b>That reasoning does not reach the
	 * arrangement row (d) was taken on, and the merge with issue #357 is where that became visible.</b>
	 * Re-measured 2026-09-02 through the real {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource.parse} of the shipped
	 * knowledge base (2283 entries) and the real {@code injectRecords}, for a patient on Lamivudine
	 * 150mg / Nevirapine 200mg / Stavudine 30mg — the three drugs the ticket's own reproduction puts on
	 * the chart — asking "Can I give this patient Metformin?", the record is 215 characters with
	 * {@code withheldInteractions} 662 and reads
	 * {@code Interactions: lamivudine (Unknown severity interaction (DDInter 2.0; no mechanism
	 * description on file).); nevirapine (Unknown); stavudine (Unknown); ketoconazole (Moderate).} The
	 * same question about Lisinopril gives 213 characters, {@code withheldInteractions} 728, and
	 * {@code ketoconazole (Major)} in the same slot (since issue #564 that slot renders after
	 * {@link #DATASET_TAIL_LEAD} rather than inside the list; ADR Decision 132). Both outputs are
	 * BYTE-IDENTICAL on
	 * {@code origin/main} at {@code 85da86fb} and on this head.
	 *
	 * <p>So on that chart the three ARVs are the CHART-NAMED segment issue #357 added, {@code tailStart}
	 * is 3, and the tail renders its single dataset-order representative — this constant is not consulted
	 * and neither is the severity ordering beside it. {@code ketoconazole} is named, at
	 * {@code Levoketoconazole}'s rating under {@code ketoconazole}'s name, which is the collision. What
	 * the compact form still withholds is a mechanism paragraph naming {@code levoketoconazole} by
	 * itself: {@code name (Severity)} carries no such paragraph, so the record ends up with nothing that
	 * distinguishes the two rows the fold collapsed. That absence is what row (d) recorded; it is
	 * reached by the one-representative rule rather than by this cap. Issue #355 changes which drugs get
	 * named where nothing patient-specific was shown, and does not touch the rating a fold prints — so
	 * this is issue #196's to repair, and the arrangement is issue #357's.

	 * readable (a patient on simvastatin asked about clarithromycin, 0/6; a patient with a severe
	 * aspirin allergy asked about ibuprofen, 0/4, while quoting the NSAID family list back verbatim
	 * when asked). Supplying more evidence is measurably not the lever, and three prompt variants
	 * regressed. So the finding becomes a record: reporting a line already in front of it is something
	 * the model does reliably.
	 *
	 * <p>Computed by calling {@code validate} with an EMPTY answer — the production path, unmodified.
	 * That makes the drugs in play exactly the question-named ones (the answer contributes none), and
	 * runs the contraindication and interaction passes while contributing no dose-excess warning,
	 * which is correct: a dose warning is about a dose the answer proposes, and there is no answer yet.
	 * No second definition of any safety rule is introduced.
	 *
	 * <p>A question that names no drug is therefore not automatically finding-free. Two checks in
	 * {@code validate} have no drug in play at all, and both reach this pass:
	 * <ul>
	 *   <li>the patient's own active orders screened against EACH OTHER when the question asks to be
	 *       screened for interactions (issue #113) — that gate reads the QUESTION only;</li>
	 *   <li>the patient's own active orders checked against their own allergy and condition records
	 *       (issue #143, {@code DrugSafetyValidator.addActiveOrderContraindications}) — whose SUBJECTS
	 *       read only the chart, and whose bound reads the response's subject matter. It does read the
	 *       drugs-in-play set, but only to skip what the loop above has already covered; see the
	 *       parenthetical below.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * The first cannot differ between this pre-answer pass and the post-answer chips pass. The second
	 * CAN, and only in the safe direction: this pass calls {@code validate} with an EMPTY answer, so
	 * its subject matter is the question alone, while the chips pass adds the answer and the records it
	 * cited — a superset of the same texts, with the three question-derived widenings identical either
	 * way. Every test {@code SubjectMatter} applies is monotone in those texts, so the findings of this
	 * pass are a SUBSET of the chips beside the answer. That is the direction this property exists for:
	 * a finding in the prompt is never asserted without a chip beside the answer. The converse — a chip
	 * whose record was not in the prompt — the drug-in-play arm above has always allowed, since a drug
	 * only the ANSWER names cannot be known before there is an answer. Pinned by
	 * {@code SubjectMatterScopedContraindicationTest
	 * .theInjectorsPreAnswerFindingsAreASubsetOfTheChipsBesideTheAnswer}, over an arrangement whose
	 * pre-answer set is deliberately NON-empty — the first version of that case asserted zero findings
	 * and then iterated them, so it pinned nothing. (The #143 arm skips a drug already in play, so a
	 * question naming one of the patient's own orders moves that chip from this arm to the drug-in-play
	 * loop rather than adding or dropping one — the same chips, from a different arm.)
	 *
	 * <p><b>A THIRD channel carries this patient's own contraindication findings into the prompt, and
	 * it is neither of those.</b> {@link #contraindicationSections} marks a rendered clause "Recorded
	 * for this patient" on an injected {@code drug_reference} record, off
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.recordedContraindicationKind} and — since issue #269 for a self-named
	 * allergy rule, and since issue #309 for a condition rule — {@link #corroborated}, which NARROWS
	 * that match rather than adding a second route to
	 * the marking: a clause the match reaches and corroboration does not takes a third section instead,
	 * claiming nothing about the patient. That method's javadoc
	 * used to call the marking exact — "which is exactly when the ledger raises a chip for that key" —
	 * and the order leg no longer satisfies it: {@link #matchingEntries} admits an active order that
	 * merely SHARES a class with a question-named drug, such an entry is not in the drugs-in-play set,
	 * so its chip goes through {@code SubjectMatter} while the clause is marked regardless. The
	 * statement the record makes is still true (the chart does record it), and the residue is bounded:
	 * no two entries of the bundled curated file share a level-4 subgroup or the shipped NSAID group,
	 * and the {@code ddinter} and {@code atc} sources publish no contraindication rules at all, so it
	 * takes a deployment-authored dataset relating two entries. Stated rather than left to be
	 * rediscovered, because it is the one place a patient-specific contraindication can still reach the
	 * prompt with no chip beside it, and a wider curated file is the documented expansion path.
	 *
	 * <p>The list is empty whenever the deterministic layer finds nothing, so a question that nothing
	 * bears on gains no record and its abstention survives by construction rather than by prompt
	 * wording — the direction issue #107 guards.

	 * compiling and silently inert on the production path; a plain three-argument CALL SITE is
	 * not, because an overload would leave it compiling and correct. Both populations move with

	/**
	 * The patient's active drug orders that {@code chart} carries no drug-order record for — the
	 * reconciliation of the drug-safety layer's {@code OrderService} read against the serialized
	 * chart the answer is grounded in (issue #118). WARNs when it finds any: the two reads
	 * disagreeing is an anomaly an operator needs to see, and it was previously silent.
	 *
	 * <p>Why this exists. The safety layer reads active orders straight from {@code OrderService}
	 * ({@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder}); the answer is grounded only in the querystore chart.
	 * That independence is a strength — it is what kept the chips correct when the index was behind
	 * — but nothing compared the two, so a divergence surfaced to the clinician as the module
	 * contradicting itself: a chip naming "active order simvastatin" beside an answer stating "No
	 * active medications are recorded." (3.7.1 standalone, HEAD {@code 13690b1}; three phrasings,
	 * so not phrasing sensitivity). Injecting the orders the chart cannot substantiate degrades the
	 * divergence into a missing-record repair instead: the model has the medication list in front of
	 * it, which is the mechanism #110 established for the safety findings.
	 *
	 * <p>Index drift was only the trigger, and fixing it belongs to querystore, which owns
	 * indexing. The same divergence is reachable from a query racing an in-flight index write, a
	 * failed indexing advice, or a partial reindex, so the reconciliation is not conditioned on any
	 * cause.
	 *
	 * <p>An order is substantiated by a chart record carrying its {@code Order} uuid (querystore
	 * indexes its {@code drug_order} document under exactly that — its
	 * {@code DrugOrderRecordSerializer} contract, so the match is exact), or failing that by a
	 * drug-order record whose text names the drug and that is not a record of an order that has
	 * ENDED. Since issue #379 that is not a walk of its own: substantiated is defined AS
	 * {@link DrugOrderRecords#numbersFor} answering with anything, so this test and the citation
	 * reading beside it are built from one index of the chart rather than from two walks of it. They
	 * are not the same RULE — {@link DrugOrderRecords#citableNumberFor} refuses more, and says why.
	 *
	 * <p>The name fallback is deliberate insurance in the
	 * conservative direction: were the uuid contract to change, uuid-only matching would report
	 * every order as missing on every query, and a WARN that fires always reports nothing. A
	 * <em>live</em> drug-order record naming the drug already tells the model the patient has an
	 * order for it, so there is nothing for the answer to deny and nothing to repair.
	 *
	 * <p><b>That argument is about THIS question only, and issue #379 added one it does not cover.</b>
	 * Over-matching is free where the answer is "do not WARN, do not inject"; it is a false claim where
	 * the answer is a citation naming WHICH prescription a record is. So the citation reading applies a
	 * refusal of its own rather than borrowing this leg unchanged —
	 * {@link DrugOrderRecords#citableNumberFor}, which carries the measured case.
	 *
	 * <p>That insurance is unavailable for one class of order, and it is worth naming because the
	 * failure it guards against would be silent for it: an order no name could be read for
	 * ({@code ActiveDrugOrder.namedByCodesOnly}, issue #290) carries no names, so {@code namedIn} can
	 * never be true and it is matched by uuid ALONE. It is still reconciled — before #290 it never
	 * reached this list at all — but if the uuid contract drifts, this class of order is where the
	 * drift shows up as a permanent repair rather than as a caught discrepancy.
	 *
	 * <p>Issue #413 adds a partially insured member beside it: an order whose coded {@code Drug}
	 * could not be read keeps whatever its concept and free text name it with, so {@code namedIn} can
	 * still be true. What it can miss is chart prose that renders the prescription under the DRUG's
	 * name, which is the spelling querystore's order text prefers — and misses it only where the
	 * concept is named differently, the two coinciding often enough that the standard dataset's own
	 * order 111 matches either way. So the name fallback is sometimes narrower for such an order than
	 * for a healthy one, without being unavailable.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>Two ways that fallback used to over-match, both fixed, both of which suppressed the
	 * WARN as well as the repair</strong> — so the discrepancy became invisible rather than merely
	 * unrepaired, which is worse than not having the check.
	 *
	 * <p>First, the corpus was every {@code drug_order} record's text regardless of whether the
	 * record described a LIVE order. querystore indexes stopped and discontinued orders too (they
	 * are not voided). So in the renewal shape — stop Simvastatin 20mg, start Simvastatin 40mg, the
	 * replacement's document missing under drift — the stopped record's text named the drug, the new
	 * order counted as substantiated, and the answer reading "Stopped: …" correctly reported no
	 * active medication beside a chip naming one. Issue #118 verbatim, through the ordinary revise
	 * flow. Only records describing a live order now substantiate one — decided by the module's own
	 * order read where it has an answer ({@link RecordMapping#getOrderActive()}, issue #317) and by
	 * the rendered text where it does not ({@link #describesEndedOrder}). The first is what covers
	 * the same renewal shape when the old order lapsed by its {@code auto_expire_date} instead of
	 * being stopped, which querystore renders no marker for and prose therefore cannot see.
	 *
	 * <p>Second, the match itself was a plain substring test, so a short order name was found inside
	 * an unrelated word — an active {@code ASA} order read as substantiated by
	 * {@code "Drug order: Nasal spray"} — and a sibling record could mask an order whose name is a
	 * substring of it ({@code Aspirin} inside {@code Aspirin/Dipyridamole}).
	 * {@code ActiveDrugOrder.namedIn} now shares {@link DrugReference#containsWord} — the existing
	 * symmetric-boundary rule, which is also the rule alias-in-prose matching applies (since issue #330
	 * {@code matchesText} reaches it through the folded arity {@code foldedWordMatch} rather than
	 * through this method, which is the same rule and the same allowance) — rather than introducing a
	 * third matcher beside it and {@code matchesOrderName}. Which of those two it borrows is a real
	 * decision, not a coin toss; {@code namedIn}'s javadoc records why the symmetric one is the
	 * correct and the safe choice for this direction.
	 *
	 * <p>Only reconciled when the chart claims to carry every drug-order record
	 * ({@link PatientChart#isCompleteFor}). A query-scoped slice — the DEFAULT chart mode — omits
	 * everything outside the question's typed scope by design, so absence there says nothing about
	 * the index; treating it as drift would WARN and inject a medication list on nearly every
	 * query. A medications question does scope the slice to drug orders, which is precisely the
	 * question that produced the observed contradiction, so the default mode is still covered.

	 * ({@code .aDisplayWhoseOtherOrderCanCiteNothingStatesNoNumberWhicheverComesFirst}), and the

	 * of the display ({@code .aDisplayStruckByOneSiblingIsNotRestoredByAThird}), where the removal is
	 * undone by a put that finds no value left to disagree with; at two orders the second put is the
	 * last one and the two strikes are indistinguishable.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The record-side rule is asked of CANDIDACY, not of the numbers orders resolved TO</b>

	 * carried first — cannot see a record two orders both name where one of them resolved to nothing,
	 * so it handed that record to the survivor. Moving the question to
	 * {@link DrugOrderRecords#recordsSeveralOrdersName} made that check dead: with it in place no two
	 * orders can come back with one number, measured by deleting the check and running the suite.
	 *
	 * <p>A blank display is skipped so the map cannot hold a key nothing will look up —
	 * {@code chartOrderClause} keys on {@code SafetyWarning.ChartOrderBridge.getOrderDisplay()}, and
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.displayNamesADrug} requires a non-blank display before an order can be
	 * bridged at all, so such an order has no item to number. It is NOT what prevents an NPE — the
	 * null-safe read below that is — and saying so keeps the clause from looking better defended than
	 * it is; it discriminates no test.
	 *
	 * <p>A null {@code context} states nothing, which is the same answer an empty order list gives and
	 * is the shape {@link #unrepresentedActiveOrders} already guards: {@link #injectRecords} runs to

	 * to the substantiation corpus only when this method AND {@link RecordMapping#getOrderActive()}
	 * both leave it live — the second being the module's own {@code OrderService} read, carried down
	 * from {@code QueryStoreChartBuilder.toSerializedRecords}. Conjunction, not precedence: neither
	 * can overrule the other, and each can only ever exclude more. So this method still decides on its
	 * own for every record the read cannot speak for — {@code SerializedRecord.getOrderActive()} is
	 * the one place those are enumerated, deliberately, so this javadoc cannot go stale as that list
	 * grows — and the read decides on its own for the order that lapsed by its
	 * {@code auto_expire_date}, which querystore renders no marker for.
	 *
	 * <p>Why prose was the only test until then, and why the second one is not the route this javadoc
	 * used to anticipate. querystore also carries the structural signal in its {@code QueryDocument}
	 * metadata ({@code putOrderBaseFields} puts {@code action}, {@code date_stopped} and
	 * {@code auto_expire_date} there), and that metadata was dropped upstream. But reading it would
	 * have meant re-deriving {@code Order.isActive()} — voided, activated, discontinued, expired —
	 * from three fields in a second implementation, and it would still rest on metadata surviving
	 * querystore's index round-trip, which is not exercised by this module's tests. Reading
	 * {@code OrderService} instead asks the same authority the drug-safety layer reads, so the chart
	 * and the chips answer off the same data rather than off the index and the database respectively.
	 * They do not share a call site — the safety layer screens with {@code getActiveOrders}, the chart
	 * with {@code Order.isActive()} — so this is agreement between two predicates, not agreement by
	 * construction, and it is pinned as such rather than assumed:
	 * {@code DrugOrderCurrencyMarkTest.theTwoPredicatesTheModuleAsksAgreeOnEveryOrderEitherCanEvaluate}
	 * drives both over one patient's whole drug-order list and asserts they classify each order
	 * alike, so a core change that splits them reddens a test instead of splitting the chart's prose
	 * from the chips built beside it. It excludes the one row where they differ by construction —
	 * {@code Order.isActive()} throws where the SQL answers — and asserts that exclusion.
	 *
	 * <p>Because it keys on rendered prose, the markers are pinned against the REAL querystore
	 * serializer's output in {@code QuerystoreOrderTextMarkerTest} — a wording change there fails
	 * loudly instead of silently reopening issue #118.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>What this method cannot see, and what now covers it.</strong> Running that serializer
	 * (rather than reading it) showed querystore does NOT render an auto-expire date into the text: an
	 * order that lapsed by {@code autoExpireDate} passing carries no end marker at all, so on this
	 * test alone it went on substantiating the live order that replaced it. It no longer does — the
	 * caller AND-s this with {@link RecordMapping#getOrderActive()}, and that answer excludes it
	 * (issue #317); {@code AuthoritativeEndedOrderSubstantiationTest} pins the exclusion. What is
	 * still true, and is why this method's own contract matters, is that the TEXT carries no end
	 * marker for such an order — {@code QuerystoreOrderTextMarkerTest} pins that, so it fails loudly
	 * if querystore ever starts rendering one, at which point this method covers auto-expiry on its
	 * own and that test's expectation flips.

	 * fires on the ended record's field, and this line has no field for it to fire on. That is not
	 * the only difference between the two lines — the record-type prefix differs too — but it is
	 * the one the rule reads. Measured on exactly that chart, both question shapes, the #315 prompt
	 * and the base alike: the answer cites THIS line and calls the drug current, and neither arm
	 * attaches "no longer in force" to it (n=2 per cell, one arrangement, one local model — enough to
	 * refute the failure mode, not enough to call it impossible). Recorded because the next person to
	 * change either the field or this line's shape needs to know they are load-bearing together; ADR
	 * Decision 47 carries it as a residue rather than a guarantee.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>Since issue #553 an order that has not started renders otherwise</strong>:
	 * {@code "Scheduled drug order: <display>. Order status: scheduled to start <date>."}, the status a
	 * real record of it carries ({@code PatientChartSerializer.scheduledOrderStatus}), so the stand-in does
	 * not call a drug due to start next month an active one. The display is still the only drug name the

	/**
	 * Deduplicated union of question-driven and patient-driven matches, query matches first — <b>one

	 *
	 * <p>The rendered row is carried together with the substance's whole row GROUP rather than the group
	 * being re-derived at the render site, because the group is gone by then: a renderer handed only the
	 * surviving row could not tell a substance filed as one row from a substance filed as four whose
	 * siblings the chart never named. Two things are read off it there and neither changes which row is
	 * rendered — {@link #rowAttribution} says which row that is, and {@link #otherRowDosing} says what the
	 * others publish. See {@link SubstanceRendering}.
	 *
	 * <p>Order-driven injection is <em>relevance-scoped</em>: an active-order reference is injected only
	 * when the question is about a specific drug clinically related to that order (sharing an ATC
	 * chemical subgroup or a curated cross-reactivity group — a real duplicate-therapy /
	 * cross-reactivity concern). An active medication unrelated to the asked-about drug — or a
	 * question that names no drug at all — is not injected: it would be noise that helps the
	 * clinician in no way. The safety validator reads active orders directly, so the chips never
	 * depend on this injection; the answer's medication awareness comes from the chart's own
	 * drug-order records, and from {@link #unrepresentedActiveOrders} for any the chart is missing.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Which orders are candidates is the caller's answer, not this method's (issue #151).</b> The
	 * order leg resolved its own candidates through {@code DrugReferenceService.findByActiveOrders} —
	 * the ATC-only primitive — while {@code DrugSafetyValidator.validate} has screened
	 * {@code findForActiveOrders} (ATC ∪ name ∪ bridged concept) since issue #148 extracted that union
	 * into a method of its own (its name leg carries issue #147's recorded-name matcher). The split
	 * is not merely an inconsistency; it made this leg ask its two questions off two different keys:
	 * an order's RELEVANCE came from the reference ENTRY's own ATC codes ({@link #relatedToAny} reads
	 * {@code order.atcSubgroups()}), while its MEMBERSHIP came from the ORDER's concept mappings. Only
	 * the second is sparse — a dictionary maps a minority of drug concepts to ATC, while the knowledge
	 * base publishes ATC for most of its entries — so an order the relevance rule would have admitted
	 * at once could not be a candidate to be asked about. See
	 * {@code OrderDrivenInjectionResolutionTest}, which pins the shape rather than a coverage figure
	 * (the figure is a property of a deployment's dictionary and rots; the shape does not). Taking the
	 * list the caller already resolved fixes the key and removes the second resolution in one move: the
	 * injector cannot now disagree with the chips about which orders the patient has, because it no
	 * longer has an opinion of its own.
	 *
	 * <p>The gate is deliberately NOT widened with it, so this is a change of candidates and not of
	 * policy. What reaches the prompt is still only what the question's own drug is in a family with —
	 * see that test's unrelated-order and no-drug-question cases, which are what distinguish this from
	 * "inject every active order".
	 *
	 * <p><b>Two consequences of a wider candidate set that are not "one more record".</b> Neither is new
	 * in kind — both were already reachable through an ATC-mapped order — but both are now the common
	 * case rather than the rare one, so they are stated here rather than discovered.
	 * <ul>
	 *   <li>{@link #collect} folds over a SUPERSET, so a substance the question leg represented by a
	 *       route-qualified row can now be represented by the route-unspecified one — a different
	 *       {@code resourceId} on the wire and a different row's rules rendered. The direction is
	 *       monotone and is the one issue #163 asks for ({@link DrugReference#canonicalRow} never moves
	 *       AWAY from {@link DrugReference#namesNoRoute()}).
	 *       <p>Since issue #250 that fold has a second rung, so "monotone" no longer means it moves only
	 *       toward {@code namesNoRoute()}: it may also move LATERALLY, between two rows that agree on it,
	 *       toward the row the data files the substance under. All three moves the rung makes over the
	 *       shipped KB are of that kind. The consequence stated above is unchanged and now covers the
	 *       lateral case too — a different {@code resourceId} and a different row's rules rendered,
	 *       without any change in route-qualification.</p>
	 *       <p><b>Read "{@code namesNoRoute()}" here as the predicate and never as the raw string.</b>
	 *       Issue #250's second half corrected that predicate to say that a trailing parenthetical which
	 *       IS the name the data files the row's family under qualifies nothing, so an elected row may
	 *       now CARRY a trailing parenthetical while answering true. TWO shipped families elect such a
	 *       row — the influenza A/Vietnam antigen and the tick-borne encephalitis vaccine — and only the
	 *       first ALSO holds a plain sibling, which is the narrower class
	 *       {@link DrugReference#namesNoRoute()}'s javadoc and
	 *       {@code SubstanceNameRowTest.everyFamilyElectingAQualifiedRowOverAPlainSiblingIsNamedRatherThanCounted}
	 *       are about; do not read a figure for one as a figure for the other. This record's rendered row
	 *       moves for the A/Vietnam family, from a name carrying no parenthetical to one that does. The
	 *       invariant this bullet rests on is unchanged under the predicate; what it is NOT is a claim
	 *       about the shape of the string. The version of that invariant stated on raw syntax lives in
	 *       {@code SubstanceNameRowTest.aFamilyWithAnUnqualifiedRowElectsOneAndNoOtherRowSpeaksForIt}.</p>
	 *       <p>This used to add "and it makes this record agree with the chip layer's subject rather
	 *       than diverge from it". That was true when written and is <b>not</b> true now, which is
	 *       issues #237/#259: since issue #194 anchored a chip's subject on the CHART and issue #206
	 *       gave every arm one answer, the chip layer's subject is {@code interactionSubject}'s and
	 *       moving toward {@code namesNoRoute()} moves this record AWAY from it wherever the patient's
	 *       own record names a qualified row. What reconciles them is {@link #rowAttribution}, which
	 *       says which row this record is — deliberately rather than changing which row it renders,
	 *       for the coverage reason recorded there.</p></li>
	 *   <li>An order that IS the question's drug shares every subgroup with itself, so the order leg
	 *       collects it. Under the default configuration that is invisible — the question leg collected
	 *       it first — but with {@code injectFromQuery=false} the order leg is now what supplies it on a
	 *       dictionary that maps no ATC codes. That is the behaviour {@code docs/drug-kb-demo.md}'s
	 *       path-7 recipe documents as the feature, previously reachable only where the concept happened
	 *       to be mapped; no self-identity skip is added here for that reason.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * @param orderEntries the reference entries the patient's active orders resolve to, already resolved
	 *        by {@link #injectRecords}. Never null — {@code findForActiveOrders} answers an empty list
	 *        for a null context, which is what makes this the same guard the removed {@code context !=
	 *        null} was. No null check is added for it deliberately: a null here would be swallowed by
	 *        {@code inject}'s catch and drop the WHOLE injection, question-driven records and safety
	 *        findings included, behind one WARN, so the coupling is pinned by a test that goes red
	 *        instead ({@code OrderDrivenInjectionResolutionTest
	 *        .aNullClinicalContextStillInjectsTheQuestionsOwnDrug})
	 * @param question the clinician's query, which drives the question leg and scopes the order leg
	 * @param questionDrugs the reference entries {@code question} puts in play, resolved ONCE by
	 *        {@link #injectRecords} and handed down rather than derived again here — issue #151's
	 *        rule, taken for this leg since issue #354 because the caller now needs the same answer
	 *        to decide whether the question named a drug CLASS instead. Through
	 *        {@link DrugReferenceService#findImpliedByQuery} and not the bare {@code findByQuery}
	 *        (issue #209), and through the same accessor {@code DrugSafetyValidator}'s drugs-in-play
	 *        set uses, so a record can never be injected for a substance no chip arm is checking:
	 *        prose carrying one alias of two substances injected a citable record for each, so a
	 *        question about hydrocortisone injected {@code Hydrocortisone butyrate} as well, an ester
	 *        nobody named. It is needed whatever {@code fromQuery} says, because it also scopes the
	 *        order leg
	 * @param fromQuery whether the question-driven leg is enabled
	 *        ({@code GP_DRUG_REFERENCE_INJECT_FROM_QUERY}), read ONCE per injection by the caller for
	 *        the reason the contraindication reading is: a flag that flipped mid-injection would
	 *        leave one record carrying a different reading from the next
	 * @param context the patient's clinical context AFTER

	 *        exactly as it did before issues #237/#259; it is the same latitude
	 *        {@code orderEntries} has, and {@code ReferenceRecordRowAttributionTest

	 *         row for three shipped substances, and the proxy then read agreement as "the chart chose
	 *         nothing" — suppressing this clause on the arrangement that needs it most, where the record
	 *         renders one row and every chip beside it names another. So the question is now put to the
	 *         chart itself ({@link DrugSafetyValidator#recordNamesMoreStrongly}, asked of the row this
	 *         record RENDERS): does the patient's own record claim the subject more strongly than the row
	 *         published here? That is what this clause's sentence asserts, and unlike the proxy it cannot
	 *         drift as the fold's rungs change. Still a READ of the existing accessors and not a third
	 *         ranking — the composition that decides a subject stays in one place.
	 *
	 *         <p>It matters because {@code rowAttribution}'s sentence says "the row this patient's record
	 *         names". Widening the group to every row the pass resolved (see the caller) makes the fold
	 *         able to move the subject off the rendered row on its own — a question naming one
	 *         route-qualified row while the patient is on an order whose display name ties every row, for
	 *         instance — and calling that "the row this patient's record names" is a claim about a chart
	 *         that said no such thing.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>KNOWN RESIDUE, stated rather than discovered.</b> Answering null here is silence, not
	 *         agreement, and one divergence survives it: a question resolving only a qualified row renders
	 *         that row's record, while the chip layer — whose group is the wider union — names the
	 *         substance by the row the fold elects. The chart chose neither, so this stays quiet and the
	 *         two surfaces still differ with nothing saying so. That is issue #237's shape surviving in
	 *         the one case this method deliberately does not speak to, and
	 *         {@code ReferenceRecordRowAttributionTest.aSubjectTheFoldMovedRatherThanTheChartIsAttributed
	 *         ToNobody} pins the silence rather than blessing the divergence.
	 *
	 *         <p>Its MECHANISM changed with issue #250 even though the residue did not, so do not read the
	 *         older account of it: this used to compare the fold over the SUBJECT group against the row
	 *         rendered from the narrower INJECTED set, and the divergence was partly an artefact of the
	 *         comparison straddling two row sets. It no longer straddles them — the rendered row is passed
	 *         in — so what is left is the honest core of it: where no recorded name claims either row, no
	 *         sentence can truthfully say the chart preferred one, whatever the fold decided.
	 *
	 *         <p>Closing it needs a SECOND sentence rather than a wider guard: the existing one would be
	 *         false there, because no recorded name chose the row, so the choice is between a differently
	 *         worded clause for the fold-moved case and leaving it. That is a wording decision with no
	 *         measurement behind it yet, and this module does not invent clinician-facing vocabulary on a
	 *         guess — see {@code DrugSafetyValidator.ceilingAttribution}, whose wording was settled by
	 *         issue #244 against measured alternatives.

	 *
	 * <p>The rows are KEPT rather than folded as they arrive (issues #237/#259). The first two choices
	 * were a pairwise fold here until the second was needed, and only the first can be made that way:
	 * {@code canonicalRow} is associative over pairs, while the subject ranking takes a MAXIMUM over the
	 * group's claims and then folds among the rows tied on it, which two rows at a time cannot compute.
	 * Approximating it pairwise would be a local variant of a decision CLAUDE.md gives exactly one
	 * definition, and it is the variant that answers differently on precisely the families this is for.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why the key is the substance (issue #163).</b> This map was keyed on {@code ref.getId()}, and
	 * route/formulation variants of one substance deliberately carry DISTINCT ids — the {@code ddinter}
	 * parser falls back to the DDInter id when the RxCUI is shared, precisely so citations stay
	 * unambiguous — so one question word injected one near-duplicate record per variant, each rendering
	 * up to {@link #MAX_INTERACTION_RENDER_CHARS} of interaction prose. That is prompt budget spent
	 * several times over on one drug (issues #95, #99), and several differently-worded copies of one fact
	 * handed to a model that miscopies them (#142). Invisible from the REST response, which returns only
	 * CITED references, which is why it survived several live verification passes.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The id remains the fallback</b>, rather than {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()}'s
	 * object identity, because THIS map's job includes what the id was originally chosen for: the
	 * surviving entry's id becomes the injected {@link RecordMapping}'s resourceId, so two records
	 * sharing an id would make a citation ambiguous. A source publishing no substance name (the curated
	 * {@code json} file, the {@code atc} adapter) therefore keeps exactly the de-duplication it had.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What the collapse gives up</b>, measured rather than assumed. The surviving row's rules are
	 * the ones the record renders, and a sibling can carry a partner the survivor does not: over the
	 * shipped KB, 80 of the 121 multi-row substances have at least one such partner, 2627 in total, a few
	 * of them lopsided ({@code Olopatadine} 112 partners against its family's 397) — measured 2026-08-06,
	 * re-measure before relying on the figures.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What that costs, per leg, because the two legs differ.</b> For the QUESTION-driven leg it
	 * costs breadth only: the substance is then also a drug in play, so a partner the patient is on whose
	 * rule clears the severity floor raises a chip whatever row carries it (the chips read every row off
	 * {@code getAll()}, and since issue #162 they read the substance's rows as one subject), and since
	 * issue #110 that chip is injected as its own citable safety-finding record carrying the rule's
	 * mechanism note verbatim. What the sibling rows lose there is the dataset tail — which
	 * {@code render} already reduces to one compact representative, in its own section under
	 * {@link #DATASET_TAIL_LEAD} (issue #564), whenever a relevant partner is promoted.
	 *
	 * <p>For the ORDER-driven leg no chip stands behind it, and that is worth stating rather than being
	 * covered by the sentence above. That leg needs {@link #relatedToAny}, hence a question that named a
	 * drug, and the substance it injects is an ACTIVE ORDER rather than a drug in play — so
	 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator}'s drug-in-play arm does not see it, and the one arm that does cover
	 * (active order, active order) pairs is gated on the question naming NO drug, which excludes this
	 * leg by construction. A rule between two of the patient's own medications that sits only on a
	 * sibling row is therefore prose this record no longer carries and no chip replaces. Narrower than
	 * it sounds — it needs the question's drug to be ATC-related to one order and that order's substance
	 * to be multi-row — but it is a real reduction in what the prompt carries, not a re-presentation of
	 * it. Less narrow since issue #151 than when that was written: the leg's candidate set is now every
	 * order the reference data RESOLVES — by ATC code or by display name — rather than the ATC-mapped
	 * subset of them, so a deployment whose dictionary maps few drug concepts reaches this residue where
	 * it previously could not reach the leg at all.
	 *
	 * <p>Issue #174's {@code orderedInteractionNotes} sweep did NOT close that residue and was never
	 * going to: it collapses several rules of ONE entry that name one PARTNER, which is the other
	 * axis. Widening this map to read every row of a substance is the change that would close it, and
	 * it is a different one — the surviving entry's id is this record's citation id, so a record
	 * assembled from several rows would have to choose one and then cite prose the chosen row does not

	 * writing a second clause because prompt wording here is measured rather than argued — ADR
	 * Decision 42 already records this lead's own exact wording as unmeasured — and a new unmeasured
	 * sentence in citable evidence is the larger risk; nothing false about the PATIENT is asserted

	 * order through its WHO ATC map alone, every chart record the model can read names that order
	 * something else — a local brand — so the finding is unciteable by construction: nothing in the
	 * prompt connects it to any record of this patient, and the model resolves that by disclaiming.
	 * Measured on the 3.7.1 standalone (issue #349, three runs, identical): a Major
	 * {@code Simvastatin x Clarithromycin} chip off orders named {@code Zolvimix} and {@code Klarizom}
	 * beside an answer reading "The records do not address interactions between the patient's current
	 * medications." Nothing else in that prompt could have supplied the connection — a screening
	 * question names no drug, so {@link #matchingEntries} scopes in no {@code drug_reference} record,
	 * and the chart already substantiated both orders, so {@link #unrepresentedActiveOrders} injected
	 * none either.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why the wording is a RESOLUTION and not an identity.</b> "Clarithromycin from Zolvimix"
	 * says this module read that substance off that order, which is true of a combination brand
	 * carrying several substances' codes. It deliberately does not say the prescription IS the
	 * substance, nor that the substance's class classifies the prescription — the false claim #339's
	 * reverted rounds 5-6 made by naming a constituent, in this very text, which {@link #renderFinding}
	 * copies verbatim into a citable record carrying {@link #STRENGTH_WITHHOLD}. So the clause is
	 * additive beside the printed name rather than a second answer to which name to print, and nothing
	 * in {@code DrugSafetyValidator}'s naming ladder is consulted or re-decided.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The lead ENDS a sentence and the items are their own</b>, which is a fidelity decision
	 * rather than a style one. {@code ReferenceProseFidelityCheck} treats a record sentence reproduced
	 * WHOLE as faithful however the answer goes on, and covers the seam and not a clause's interior; the
	 * lead alone clears that check's {@code MIN_REPRODUCED_WORDS} floor, so joined to the items by a
	 * colon it would put its own invariant boilerplate inside a sentence whose interior carries order
	 * displays the live model is on record paraphrasing and misspelling. Ending it restores the exit for
	 * the half that never varies. The items' own interior is still uncovered, and that is inherent to
	 * carrying variable content rather than something a wording fixes.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Flat, {@code "; "}-joined and number-agnostic.</b> One item and three items read alike, so
	 * no branch decides between "order" and "orders" — and a substance the pass resolved from two
	 * orders gets one item per order rather than a conjunction the prose would have to inflect. The
	 * legibility cost is real and is the same trade #339 settled: on a combination brand two items can
	 * name one prescription twice, which is a reading rather than a false claim.
	 *
	 * <p>Package-private, like the three section leads and unlike {@link #STRENGTH_WITHHOLD}: that
	 * constant is public because {@code LlmProvider.DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT} carries it verbatim, and
	 * this clause has no such consumer. It teaches the prompt no new call — it is evidence inside a
	 * record the prompt already instructs the model to carry whole, exactly as
	 * {@link #FINDING_UNCORROBORATED_MATCH} is.
	 *
	 * <p><b>{@code DrugSafetyValidator.StatedInteractionChips} does NOT key on it.</b> Adding it to
	 * that key was tried and reverted in review: the key decides which chips are emitted, so it
	 * reaches {@code PairChipExtent}'s counts and, through {@code ChartSearchAiUtils.resourceKey},
	 * whether two injected findings share one resource uuid — a bridge must not be able to change
	 * which chips exist. That reason used to be stated as "this clause is prompt-facing, and keying on
	 * it would let it decide wire content"; since issue #347 the bridges ARE published, as each chip's
	 * {@code chartOrderBridges} key, and the reason above is the one that survives it. A collapsed chip
	 * therefore carries the survivor's bridge, on the wire as well as here, which is the same residue
	 * ADR Decision 63 already accepts for that collapse ("what it gives up is WHICH constituent").
	 * The chip's detail and its rank are
	 * untouched, which is issue #283's own scoping;
	 * {@code InteractionFindingChartOrderBridgeTest.theChipDetailIsTheWordsItAlwaysWas} pins it, and
	 * {@code .theClauseIsTheWordsAModelReads} pins these words.

	/**
	 * One deterministic finding as a chart line. The detail text is reused verbatim — it is the same
	 * string the chip carries, so the prose and the chip cannot describe the same finding differently —
	 * and the finding then states what it licenses, so the answer's opening
	 * call rests on what the deterministic layer decided rather than on the model's reading of a
	 * severity word inside the prose (#283). Every finding states one; see {@link #strengthClause} for
	 * why silence is not a third answer.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Of the chip THIS pass raised</b> — so the sentence above is about a pass and not about a
	 * request. Between issue #236 and issue #238 the two could differ for one arm — the question-pair
	 * arm; {@code DrugSafetyValidator.SubstanceSubjects} and ADR Decision 49 record which and why, and
	 * ADR Decision 53 records issue #238 closing it — and that is deliberately not restated here.
	 *
	 * <p>"Verbatim" is of the detail, not of the whole line: a detail that does not already end a
	 * sentence gains a full stop, so the clause after it reads as its own sentence rather than running
	 * on. That is {@link DrugSafetyValidator#endSentence}, shared with the chip's own fold rather than
	 * copied, and it is the only way the record's copy of the detail differs from the chip's.
	 *
	 * <p>Since issue #308 a contraindication finding whose match against the chart nothing
	 * CORROBORATES also states how it was matched, between the detail and the strength clause — see
	 * {@link #FINDING_UNCORROBORATED_MATCH}, and {@code SafetyWarning.restsOnAnUncorroboratedChartMatch}
	 * for where that answer is decided. Not "reached the chart by bare containment": that is one LEG of
	 * the union and it is the chip rank's condition, not this one, so a rule at the demoted rank whose
	 * substance some other recorded allergy reaches carries no clause. It is a second clause and not a
	 * second CALL — the strength clause is unchanged, so everything the paragraph above says about the
	 * answer's opening call still holds.
	 *
	 * <p>Since issue #349 an INTERACTION finding whose substances the chart records only under other
	 * names also states which of this patient's active orders each was resolved from, ahead of both
	 * clauses above — see {@link #FINDING_CHART_ORDER_LEAD} for why the finding is otherwise unciteable,
	 * and {@code DrugSafetyValidator.chartOrderBridges} for which orders may be named. It adds words and
	 * moves no call: the strength clause is unchanged and the chip's own detail is untouched. Since
	 * issue #379 each of those attributions also names the NUMBER of the record its order is, which is
	 * why this method takes that resolution as a parameter rather than deriving it — it is a fact about
	 * the chart being built, and only {@link #injectRecords} holds it.
	 *
	 * <p>The full-stop guard asks about every clause {@link #findingBody} can append, and only the
	 * strength half is known to fire. Only a
	 * contraindication can carry provenance and {@link #strengthClause} answers one unconditionally for
	 * that type, so a provenance clause never arrives without a strength beside it; and only an
	 * interaction or a condition-mediated finding can carry a BRIDGE, for each of which that method
	 * answers one unconditionally too. Said
	 * rather than left to be rediscovered — mutating the guard (in {@link #findingBody} since issue
	 * #469) to {@code !clauseFollows} alone leaves the whole api suite green, and so does dropping the
	 * bridge term. Since issue #402 it also asks about {@link #FINDING_NO_SEVERITY}, which
	 * {@link #statesNoSeverity} admits only for an unrated finding; the one declared type {@link #strengthClause}
	 * states nothing for is the overdose finding, which cannot reach this method today. All of them are
	 * kept because
	 * the clauses are independent by construction, and a type carrying one without a strength is the
	 * shape {@link #strengthClause} already warns a future caller it must write for.

	 * Decision 108. Asked once per injection, off the resolutions this pass already holds.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The module answers only with what a finding POSITIVELY states, and never with a clearance
	 * or a negative.</b> "Can be given", or "no interactions were found", is true only if every arm ran
	 * over a chart that was read in full and could resolve every record in it, which nothing here can
	 * establish — an unread allergy list, an allergen recorded as a class or a brand the data does not
	 * carry, a switched-off arm each made such an answer false, and each was found one after another.
	 * So those questions keep the model call. The one negative answer the module composes is not this method's:
	 * {@link #composeFromNoPair} states what the INTERACTION check established where it related the proposed
	 * drug to none of her orders (issue #592, ADR Decision 143) — a claim about that check alone — and
	 * {@link #composeFromNoActiveOrders} states that it had nothing to compare the drug against, for a patient
	 * with no active medication orders (ADR Decision 158).
	 *
	 * <p><b>And the "No" is licensed by an INTERACTION, never by a contraindication.</b> An interaction
	 * finding is a relationship the dataset RATES between two substances this module resolved; a
	 * contraindication finding is a curated rule's token matched against her records' free text, under a
	 * note the rule's author wrote. Review drove three false categorical "No"s through contraindications
	 * in turn — a token inside a longer word ({@code opium} in {@code Tiotropium}, flagged uncorroborated),

	 *     interaction the data rates as a reason to withhold it relates it to one of her orders
	 *     ({@link #STRENGTH_WITHHOLD} — the proposal clause, which only the drug-in-play arm states
	 *     before there is an answer, and still the one it states for a drug her chart holds only as
	 *     an ended order, since this question proposes it — issue #472). Not already taking it, because the "No" composed here refuses a
	 *     PROPOSAL, and for a drug she does take the drug-in-play arm states the current-medication
	 *     clause instead (issue #402, ADR Decision 123) — asked of {@code herSubstances}, the
	 *     substances this pass resolved her orders to. That is wider than the arm's referent, which keeps
	 *     the proposal clause for a drug her orders resolve to without establishing she takes it, and for
	 *     one a question may be proposing in a presentation she does not take; the model answers such a
	 *     question, as it did before issue #402.</li>
 * <li>The same proposal where every finding is an interaction CAUTION about that drug
 *     ({@link #cautionsOnlyAbout}, ADR Decision 140), answered under {@link #cautionLead} with each finding
 *     briefly. That is not the clearance this method refuses: it never says the drug can be given, nor that
 *     nothing else was found.</li>
	 * <li>A request to screen her own medications against each other, admitted by
	 *     {@code QueryScopeRouter.asksOnlyToScreenHerMedications}, naming no drug the dataset resolved,
	 *     where the screen related at least one pair: an INTERACTION finding, since a medication
	 *     question also raises the order-driven arm's allergy finding and an answer of that alone says
	 *     nothing of what the screen found — and not the finding that two of her orders share a
	 *     substance ({@code SafetyWarning.statesOrdersSharingASubstance}, issue #477), which relates no
	 *     pair either.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p>All need {@code chartRead}: the chart-read verdict this pass stamped. An order read and written under a name
	 * the data does not carry (a warfarin brand it lacks, a vaccine, infant formula) leaves "not already taking"
	 * unanswerable — the module cannot tell her "Marevan" is the warfarin proposed — and a screen with only part of
	 * her list to relate. Until ADR Decision 161 that kept the model call, and the model, left with the same chart,
	 * answered worse; now the answer closes by naming each such order as not checked
	 * ({@link #unidentifiedOrdersLine}). An order resolved to only SOME of its substances — a combination the data
	 * files under one constituent — passes, with the rest unseen; ADR Decision 108 names that residue.

	 *
	 * <p><b>What was asked about comes first</b>: the findings about the drug the question PROPOSED,
	 * or on a screen her interactions, ahead of any other finding about her own medications a widened
	 * question also raised — her allergy to a drug she is prescribed, say — so that such a finding
	 * cannot take the answer's first sentence and leave the question unanswered. One key does both,
	 * because the screening arm stands down for a question that resolved a drug. On a PROPOSAL the
	 * finding that two of her orders share a substance (issue #477) is such a finding, about her own
	 * orders rather than the drug proposed, so it joins that second group; on a screen it is what was
	 * asked about and stays in the first. The validator appends it after every other finding on a
	 * proposal, so in neither the chips nor this answer does it come ahead of a finding about the drug
	 * proposed (ADR Decision 116). Within each
	 * group, strongest first — withhold, change a current medication, then the two cautions, the order
	 * the prompt gives the model for the first three and this module's own choice between the last two
	 * — read off {@link #strengthClause} and never off the severity word; stable, so the injection order
	 * stands within a class except for the key below. A screen's finding that her orders share a
	 * substance (issue #477) is an interaction finding and ranks by strength with the pairs, as the
	 * prompt's ranking sentence has the model rank it, so the two paths open alike.
	 *
	 * <p><b>On a screen that sort and the arm agree</b>: the screening arm inserts the finding that her
	 * orders share a substance among its pairs by the same strength
	 * ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.addOrdersSharingASubstance}), so the chips, the prompt's records and
	 * this answer order it alike, and {@code OrdersSharingASubstanceModuleAnswerContextTest} no longer
	 * reddens without the sort. It stays because the lead is decided by the FIRST line, and that must
	 * not depend on the order the arms happen to run in.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Within the withholding class, a finding that licensed the "No" comes first</b> — {@link
	 * #licensesTheModulesNo}, the test {@link #answersFromFindings} admitted the question by. That same
	 * append order is why this key is needed: a recorded allergy to the proposed drug, or an unrated
	 * rule {@code FINDING_STRENGTH_DESCENDING} ranks above Major, states the same withholding clause
	 * and arrives first, and would otherwise be the sentence read as the reason for a "No" it cannot
	 * license (ADR Decision 108). It is scoped to that class, so a screen's order is untouched
	 * ({@code .aScreensLinesKeepTheOrderTheArmRaisedThemIn}). Issue #469's review item;
	 * {@code LlmInferenceServiceAnswerFromFindingsContextTest}
	 * {@code .theLineUnderTheNoIsTheInteractionThatLicensedIt} and
	 * {@code .aMajorInteractionLeadsAnUnratedRuleUnderTheNo}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>A contraindication about a medication she already takes carries its referent</b>, {@link
	 * #COMPOSED_CURRENT_MEDICATION_REFERENT}, after its body: the strength clause stays out, and it
	 * was the only words of such a record saying she takes the drug (ADR Decision 113). Not an
	 * interaction's line, whose detail already names the partner as her active order. Nor a line whose
	 * chip says her order for the drug has not started ({@code SafetyWarning.orderScheduledStart()},
	 * issue #553): that sentence already says the order is hers, and the referent would say she is taking
	 * a drug she has not started.
	 *
	 * <p><b>A screen's lead counts, and chooses nothing.</b> A lead saying which of two medications to change would
	 * state a choice no finding makes, which issue #469 measured the model adding in three cells; a screen's answer
	 * opens with how many of each kind of finding follow ({@link #screenLead}) and closes with {@link #SCREEN_SCOPE}
	 * (ADR Decision 171).
	 *
	 * @return the answer, or {@code null} where a finding states a clause {@link #strengthRank} does not
	 *         rank — no strength clause at all, which no reachable type does today, or an ended-order

	 *

	 * <p><b>FOUR wider sentences were written here and all four were measured false — do not write a
	 * fifth.</b> "no interaction screen was run for this class" and "this response carries no
	 * reference material for it" each fall to a screening question that fires the pairwise arm
	 * alongside this note. "An interaction screen runs against a named substance, not a class" falls
	 * to {@code DrugSafetyValidator.classRelationships}, whose {@code interaction} chip screens on a
	 * shared ATC subgroup or a shared cross-reactivity GROUP and names that group — which is this
	 * note's own class term. And "the interaction reference DATA is indexed by individual substance"
	 * falls to {@code cross-reactivity-groups.json}, which is reference data this module loads, is
	 * keyed by ATC prefix under a CLASS NAME, and in the shipped configuration is where the class
	 * name this note prints was read from. Each was written to correct the one before it, and the
	 * last widened from the screen to the data rather than narrowing. What survives says only that
	 * ENTRIES are indexed by substance name — which is what {@code DrugReference} is — and that this
	 * class resolved to none of them.

	 * <p><b>It closes by asking for a specific drug, which is the other half of the outcome issue
	 * #354 blesses</b> — "an answer that explicitly says the question named a class and asks for a
	 * specific drug". Read the two sentences together: the first says what the class did, the second
	 * says what a question would have to name for an entry to be reached at all.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why that clause survives the scrutiny the four above failed.</b> It is an IMPERATIVE
	 * about the QUESTION, so no arrangement of this response can falsify it: it states nothing about
	 * what was screened, what the response carries, or how the module or its data is indexed, which
	 * is what each of the four refuted sentences did. And it stays inside the two rules the rest of
	 * the record is written under — it names no substance (the guard below reaches it, since it is
	 * part of the rendered text that goes back through {@code findImpliedByQuery}) and it mentions no
	 * patient, so a record declared not to be about this patient still carries no clause reading as
	 * one. What it must NOT become is the promise a member-resolving version would make — "name a

	 * dataset is configurable.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It says what was not done and what to ask instead, never what to do about this

	/**
	 * The strength clause for one finding. Every finding that reaches the model states one, and that
	 * is the invariant rather than a convenience (#283).
	 *
	 * <p><b>Silence is not a third answer, and it was measured to be the wrong one.</b> The first cut
	 * of #283 scoped the clause to INTERACTION findings, on the reasoning that a recorded allergy to
	 * the drug asked about licenses withholding without needing to say so. It does not, because the
	 * same change made the prompt's evidence-against claim CONDITIONAL on the finding saying it: the
	 * addressed-safety branch now offers a withholding branch and a caution branch, and a finding
	 * matching neither antecedent falls through to whichever the model reaches for. Measured on the
	 * standalone against {@code main} @ b0cfe545, one Severe recorded Aspirin allergy, one NSAID
	 * cross-reactivity chip and no interaction finding: <em>"No — ibuprofen should not be taken"</em>
	 * became <em>"Ibuprofen can be given, with one caution"</em>, 3 of 3, on the caution
	 * demonstration's own wording. The chip was identical on both sides; only the answer's call moved.
	 * So a contraindication states a WITHHOLDING-class clause and never a caution: {@link
	 * #STRENGTH_WITHHOLD}, or since issue #348 {@link #STRENGTH_CHANGE_CURRENT_MEDICATION} where the
	 * referent is a current medication. The record says so, per {@link DrugSafetyValidator#licensesWithholding(SafetyWarning)}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>A new type may not reach this renderer silently.</b> An OVERDOSE finding cannot arrive
	 * today — {@link #preAnswerFindings} validates with an EMPTY answer and the dose arm parses a
	 * stated dose out of the answer, so the arm cannot fire before there is one — and it wants neither
	 * clause as written, being a reason to change the DOSE, which withholding overstates and a caution
	 * understates. It therefore falls to the empty default here, and that default is now a defect
	 * waiting on a caller rather than a safe fallback: whoever renders findings after an answer exists
	 * must give the type its own clause in the same change.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What guards that, and what does not.</b> The PREMISE is pinned:
	 * {@code SafetyFindingSeverityStrengthTest
	 * .theTypeThatStatesNeitherClauseCannotReachTheRendererBeforeThereIsAnAnswer} drives an arrangement
	 * that DOES raise an overdose warning through the real {@code validate} given an answer, and asserts
	 * the pre-answer path raises none — so it reddens the moment the dose arm becomes reachable from
	 * here. The CONCLUSION is not, and this javadoc claimed it was until review read the case:
	 * {@code everyInjectedFindingStatesExactlyOneStrengthClause} iterates the findings ONE fixed arrangement
	 * produced, no arrangement of {@link #injectRecords} produces an overdose finding, so it can never
	 * observe the type it was named as the guard for. Measured by mutation rather than argued: with
	 * {@link #preAnswerFindings} validating against a stated dose instead of the empty string, the
	 * premise case reddens and names the record that would reach the model ("The stated Amoxicillin
	 * dose ~4000 mg/day exceeds …", no clause on it) while
	 * {@code everyInjectedFindingStatesExactlyOneStrengthClause} stays green. A caller that renders findings
	 * after an answer exists is a new path neither case runs; it writes its own clause with no test to lean on.
	 *
	 * <p>The interaction split is {@link DrugSafetyValidator#licensesWithholding(SafetyWarning)},
	 * never a local reading of the rating, and never {@code ratingLicensesWithholding} underneath it:
	 * unrated is not low-rated, and a FOLDED finding asserts an unrated class relationship its rating
	 * does not cover — two halves a second copy would get wrong in opposite directions.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The clause is a statement about the FINDING's strength, not an instruction about a
	 * prescribing action</b> — and it names an ACT, which is where issue #348 found the strength axis
	 * insufficient. The two ORDER-DRIVEN arms have no proposal: the screening arm (#113) relates a
	 * pair both of whose drugs are the patient's own active orders, and the allergy-and-condition join
	 * (#143) checks a drug she is already taking. "Withhold it" was read there as a reason to stop
	 * rather than a reason not to start, and that reading was recorded here as sufficient. It is not:
	 * on a chart of TWO active orders the answer came back <em>"No — Salicylic acid should not be
	 * given: it interacts with active order Methotrexate, a Major problem"</em> — a prescribing refusal
	 * about a drug she is on, on a question that proposed nothing.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What ADR Decision 37 measured, and the scope its sentence was missing.</b> It reported the
	 * screening answer unchanged by the clause: <em>"Yes, there are several drug interactions
	 * recorded: …"</em>, 3/3. That arrangement is a SEVERAL-finding screen, and the reading holds
	 * there — with a set of findings the model falls back on the yes/no rule. #348's is a
	 * ONE-finding screen, which that measurement never covered, and there the clause is the only
	 * instruction the record carries. So the sentence was not wrong; its scope was unstated.
	 *
	 * <p>Hence the REFERENT axis, orthogonal to the strength axis: the two order-driven arms state
	 * {@link #STRENGTH_CHANGE_CURRENT_MEDICATION} or {@link #STRENGTH_CAUTION_CURRENT_MEDICATION},
	 * which license exactly what their proposal counterparts do. Every clause here still states a
	 * strength and none is a caution where the other pair withholds, so the strength half of this
	 * javadoc is untouched. Whether a finding is about a current medication is
	 * {@link SafetyWarning#isAboutACurrentMedication()}, established by the arm; it is never a reading
	 * of the detail. Neither is this module telling a clinician what to do, which is the line
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator}'s class javadoc draws.
	 *
	 * <p>Since issue #472 a third pair, {@link #STRENGTH_WITHHOLD_ENDED_ORDER} and
	 * {@link #STRENGTH_CAUTION_ENDED_ORDER}, for a finding about a drug the chart records only as an
	 * order no longer in force — {@link SafetyWarning#isAboutAnEndedOrder()}, set by the drug-in-play
	 * and question-pair arms and exclusive with the current-medication referent. Same strengths again;

	/**
	 * The entry's interaction notes, in three segments (see {@link #renderTier}): the partners this
	 * patient is actually on whose rules the severity floor admits, most severe of those first (see
	 * {@link #SEVERITY_DESCENDING}); then the partners she is on whose rules it filtered; then the rest
	 * in dataset order — EXCEPT that where the first two segments are both empty the third is ordered
	 * most severe first as well (issue #355; see the sort below for why the exception is conditional).
	 * Only the first segment is PROMOTED — {@code promotedCount} counts it and
	 * nothing else — and the two behind it are the dataset tail {@code render} walks in order.
	 *
	 * <p>This ordering is what makes the {@link #MAX_INTERACTION_RENDER_CHARS} cut meaningful.
	 * Rendering in dataset order let the dataset's own sequence decide which partners a clinician's
	 * model could cite: in the full DDInter KB, Clarithromycin carries 898 partners with Simvastatin
	 * (Major) at index 324, so a patient on simvastatin asking about clarithromycin got a record
	 * naming ivosidenib, kanamycin and ketoprofen — none of which they take — and the one
	 * interaction that concerned them was truncated 300 entries earlier. The model then recited
	 * what it could see. {@link DrugSafetyValidator} was unaffected throughout, because it reads
	 * every interaction off the entry and never consults this text, so the chip named simvastatin
	 * while the prose named ivosidenib: the two disagreed by construction.
	 *
	 * <p>Relevance uses {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasActiveDrug} — deliberately the same
	 * predicate {@link DrugSafetyValidator} uses to decide an interaction concerns this patient (see
	 * {@link #renderTier}, which is that predicate and the severity floor together, applied both here
	 * and inside the collapse below) — so a partner that raises a DRUG-IN-PLAY chip is exactly a
	 * partner PROMOTED here, and which partners the promoted segment names cannot drift from the chips.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Read that as a claim about the promoted segment and not about the record's lead, which
	 * since issue #357 they are no longer the same sentence.</b> A rule the floor filtered about a drug
	 * the chart DOES name now heads the tail, so where nothing is promoted the record's first note is a
	 * partner no chip stands behind. That is not the divergence this ordering exists to remove: the
	 * chips and this text still agree about which rules COUNT, because promotion still resolves the
	 * floor through {@link DrugSafetyValidator#configuredSeverityFloor} and nothing below re-decides it.
	 * What changed is only where a rule they already agree to be sub-floor sits among the rules about
	 * drugs the chart says nothing about at all.
	 *
	 * <p>Which is a claim about the SET, and since issue #297 about the NAME again. Issue #292 let a
	 * folded chip name the partner by the class arm's ladder while the note below kept
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.partnerLabel}, so for such a partner the chip and this record called one
	 * active order two things — the trade ADR Decision 39 recorded and deferred because this text is
	 * PROMPT text. It is closed by {@link #reconciledPartnerNoteName}, which takes the name off the chip that
	 * decided it rather than re-deriving it: the two surfaces name one SUBSTANCE, each in its own
	 * vocabulary, since this record's prose may not carry {@code DrugReference.displayLabel()}. Where the
	 * reconciliation refuses or reaches no co-medication, this note is {@code partnerLabel} again
	 * exactly as before.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Since issue #339 that reconciliation is asked of every rule chip and not only of a folded
	 * one, and one thing this text used to say about it no longer holds.</b> It said the prompt's name
	 * union for a partner cannot GROW, on the ground that the folded chip's CLASS sentence already
	 * carried the ladder's name. An unfolded chip has no class sentence, so for a rule-only partner the
	 * ladder's name was not previously in the prompt at all and the rule's own token can be replaced
	 * outright — ADR Decision 39 measured 2,406 of 513,026 gate-satisfying rules whose handed-out label
	 * does not contain the token. What DOES still hold is the weaker and load-bearing half: this note's
	 * name is always a name the same prompt carries, because the chip that decided it reaches the
	 * prompt verbatim through {@link #renderFinding} and the note's {@code getName()} is a word of that
	 * chip's label. So the two surfaces cannot disagree, which is what issue #297 is about.
	 *
	 * <p>Scoped to that arm deliberately, and the scope is the correction
	 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#addQuestionPairInteractions} asks for: across the whole chip set the
	 * correspondence does not hold, because a question-PAIR chip names two drugs the question named
	 * and neither need be an active order, so its partner is promoted nowhere. That does not reopen
	 * the chip-versus-prose split this ordering exists to close — since issue #110 every chip is also
	 * injected as its own numbered, citable record, carrying the chip's detail verbatim and the
	 * strength clause after it ({@code preAnswerFindings} → {@link #renderFinding}, #283), so a pair
	 * finding is grounded by that record rather than by these notes, and the promoted-note budget is
	 * untouched by it. Verbatim across passes too, not only within one: {@link #renderFinding} renders
	 * the chip the PRE-ANSWER pass raised, and between issue #236 and issue #238 the question-pair
	 * arm's subject was folded over a group the answer widens, so that record and the chip beside the
	 * answer could name one substance two ways — {@code DrugSafetyValidator.SubstanceSubjects} and ADR
	 * Decision 49 are where that residue and its measurement live. Issue #238 (ADR Decision 53) closed
	 * it: the arm's subject now comes from the naming group every question drug is already in, so the
	 * answer cannot move it. Said here as well as in the paragraph this one is paired with
	 * ({@link DrugSafetyValidator#addQuestionPairInteractions}), because the two came apart once already
	 * when only one of them was reworded.
	 *
	 * <p>That correspondence is per PARTNER, and since issue #174 site 2 this method renders one note
	 * per partner rather than one per ROW — the same collapse
	 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#bestRulePerPartner} has made for the chips since issue #115, keyed
	 * on {@link DrugSafetyValidator#partnerLabel} case-folded — that method's own fallback key, for
	 * the reasons {@link #onePerPartner} sets out — and reaching the same survivor: the row the
	 * patient is on, then {@link DrugSafetyValidator#outranksOnRule} (most severe, then the longer
	 * note). Before it, a patient on one dexamethasone order got one Major chip beside a record reading
	 * "dexamethasone (Major …); dexamethasone (Moderate …); dexamethasone (Moderate …)" — a model
	 * answering from the record could name a severity the chip deliberately discarded, and from the
	 * more quotable half, since in that measured case the discarded Moderate note is 659 characters
	 * against the surviving Major row's 326 (re-measured 2026-08-07 through the real parser over both
	 * the fixture slice and the shipped KB, which agree).
	 *
	 * <p>Measured over the shipped 19 MB KB (2026-08-07; re-measure before relying on the figures):
	 * 1876 of its 2283 entries carried at least one repeated partner and 19,316 of the 590,312
	 * expanded rows were surplus, {@code Ozanimod} carrying the largest single surplus at 49. The cost
	 * of carrying them was not only tidiness: {@code render}'s two patient-specific segments deliberately
	 * override {@link #MAX_INTERACTION_RENDER_CHARS} so that a partner the patient is on is never
	 * invisible, so a partner filed under three rows spent three notes of budget the budget could not
	 * claw back.
	 *
	 * <p>The route vocabulary that is the data-side half of #115 is still missing, and this collapse
	 * does not need it: it decides which of several rows about ONE partner to SHOW, exactly as the
	 * chip decides which to raise, and neither has to know which variant the order is. What still
	 * waits on that vocabulary is stating a variant-specific severity at all.
	 *
	 * <p>Since issue #163 there is one more way they can differ, in the opposite direction, and it is
	 * stated here rather than left to be discovered: {@link #matchingEntries} now injects ONE record per
	 * substance, so this method sees only that substance's canonical row, while
	 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#bestRulePerPartner} reads every row of it (issue #162). A partner whose
	 * rule sits only on a sibling row therefore raises a chip that this text does not name. What covers
	 * it is issue #110 rather than this method: that chip is itself injected as a citable
	 * safety-finding record carrying the rule's mechanism note verbatim ({@link #renderFinding}), which
	 * is the same mechanism a pair chip's grounding already relies on. See {@code collect} for the
	 * measured size of the residue.
	 *
	 * <p>Ordering alone is not sufficient, which is why {@code render} also overrides the budget for
	 * this segment: two above-floor partners can exceed {@link #MAX_INTERACTION_RENDER_CHARS}
	 * between them (measured on the 16-drug DDInter excerpt: methotrexate 783 + aspirin 809 against a 1500
	 * budget), and dropping the second reinstates exactly the chip-versus-prose split described
	 * above for the polypharmacy case. So the cap becomes a soft budget with a bounded overshoot
	 * rather than a hard ceiling — bounded by the patient's own active-drug count, not the dataset's
	 * breadth, and paid in the compact {@code name (Severity)} form rather than in full notes.
	 *
	 * @param context may be null (nothing to prioritise by) — nothing is then promoted, so the whole
	 *        section is the tail and is ordered most severe first (issue #355)
	 * @param orderEntries the reference entries the patient's active orders resolve to, which
	 *        {@link #onePerPartner} keys a promoted partner on (issue #190 item 2); an empty list falls
	 *        the grouping back to the label alone, as it was before that issue
	 * @param findings this injection's pre-answer chips, from which {@link #reconciledPartnerNoteName} takes
	 *        the name a rule chip gave a partner (issue #297; since #339 a chip that folded or not);
	 *        null or empty leaves every note on
	 *        {@code DrugSafetyValidator.partnerLabel}, which is what the {@code drugSafety} toggles being
	 *        off produces and what every note-text case in the suite runs on

	/**
	 * @return the name this record's interaction note must call {@code rule}'s partner by: the name the
	 *         chip about that same rule gave it where the reconciliation answered — a FOLDED chip until
	 *         issue #339 and any rule chip since
	 *         ({@link DrugSafetyValidator#partnerLabel}'s counterpart in this record's own vocabulary),
	 *         else {@code partnerLabel} itself — which is what this list has always printed.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Issue #297.</b> Since issue #292 a folded chip can name an active order by the class
	 *         arm's ladder, and that chip reaches the prompt verbatim as a citable
	 *         {@code safety_finding} ({@link #renderFinding}) — while this note kept the rule's own
	 *         token. So one prompt carried one prescription under two names, the property
	 *         {@code CLAUDE.md} states {@code partnerLabel} exists to hold.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Read off the findings this injection already holds, never re-derived.</b>
	 *         {@link #injectRecords} runs the whole fold once through {@link #preAnswerFindings}; asking
	 *         {@link DrugSafetyValidator} to walk {@code classRelationships} a second time so the two
	 *         answers could be compared is the two-resolutions-that-agree shape issue #151 forbids, and
	 *         that failure was silent and one-directional. It also makes the scope right for free: a
	 *         name can only come from a chip that was actually raised AND injected in this same
	 *         response — so every name this NOTE can newly carry is one the {@code safety_finding}
	 *         beside it already contains. That is the half of the union bound that survives issue #339;
	 *         the wider reading, that the prompt's name union for the partner cannot GROW at all, does
	 *         not, because the chip's own name moved for rule-only partners (see the paragraph on that
	 *         issue above, and ADR Decision 63). An
	 *         ORDER-DRIVEN record, which no interaction chip stands behind (see {@code collect}), is
	 *         therefore untouched rather than renamed after a chip that does not exist.
	 *
	 *         <p>The rule-identity condition is {@link SafetyWarning#reconciledPartnerNoteName}'s own,
	 *         asked there rather than here: this record collapses to one note per partner over ONE row
	 *         ({@link #onePerPartner}) while the chip chose across every row of the substance
	 *         ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.bestRulePerPartner}), so the two can elect different rules for
	 *         one partner and the answer there is then null. Falling back leaves the note exactly where
	 *         it was, which is what makes this change able only to remove a divergence and never to
	 *         create one.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Issue #339 widened what that costs on the flattened shape, and the guard below is
	 *         kept anyway.</b> The reconciliation now answers for every rule chip, so on a context
	 *         carrying only the flattened code set an UNFOLDED chip can be reconciled while this note
	 *         is not — measured through the real {@code validate} over the pinned excerpt, a chart
	 *         carrying {@code Warfarin} and {@code B01AA03} and no per-order list chips
	 *         {@code interacts with active order Warfarin} beside a note reading {@code warfarin}.
	 *         Before #339 that pair agreed, both being {@code partnerLabel}. It is the residue issue
	 *         #297 already accepted for a FOLDED chip on that same shape, reaching further; the two
	 *         surfaces still name one SUBSTANCE, which is what this record's own vocabulary paragraph
	 *         above says they share. Closing it means dropping the condition below, which is what makes
	 *         the RECORD key-dependent — the thing
	 *         {@code OrderDrivenInjectionResolutionTest.oneOrderInjectsOneRecordSetWhicheverWayItResolves}
	 *         forbids — so the trade is unchanged by #339 and is recorded rather than taken.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>And only where the context carries per-order structure</b>, which is every context
	 *         {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder} builds for a real patient. On the flattened shape of
	 *         issue #118 the class arm's own reach is key-dependent — {@code orderPartners} reads the
	 *         FLATTENED set for its code rung and the per-order list for its name rung, so the same
	 *         prescription folds when a dictionary published its ATC code and does not when it published
	 *         only its name. That asymmetry is pinned as current behaviour by
	 *         {@code DuplicateInteractionChipTest.aRuleOnlyPairIsWordedExactlyAsBefore} ("no ATC mapping,
	 *         so the class arm has nothing to say") and forbidden from reaching the PROMPT by
	 *         {@code OrderDrivenInjectionResolutionTest.oneOrderInjectsOneRecordSetWhicheverWayItResolves}
	 *         ("the prompt behind those chips cannot depend on which key the dictionary carried"). The
	 *         two together say the chip may be key-dependent on that shape and the injected records may
	 *         not, so this gate is what keeps the record out of it. Closing the asymmetry itself was
	 *         attempted and abandoned in the same change: a name rung over the flattened set reddens the
	 *         first of those two tests, because it makes the class arm speak where that test says it must
	 *         not. Issue #228 already made the ORDER-carrying shape key-symmetric, which is why the gate
	 *         costs production nothing.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>The fallback below and the fold's own answer for its non-entry rungs are one method,
	 *         not two spellings.</b> {@code DrugSafetyValidator.reconciledPartnerName} hands the note
	 *         {@code partnerLabel(rule)} on its NON-entry rungs — the rungs where no dataset name has
	 *         been PROVED to be this rule's, which is not the same as the dataset having none for the
	 *         partner — and that is verbatim what this method returns when it finds nothing, so a rule
	 *         reconciled on those rungs and a rule not reconciled at all print the same string BECAUSE
	 *         both call {@code partnerLabel}, which is what that method exists to be. Keep it that way:
	 *         if this fallback ever became something else, those rungs would keep the old string while
	 *         every unreconciled partner took the new one, and one prescription would be named two ways
	 *         inside one interaction list — issue #297 reopened a rung along.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>An ORDER-DRIVEN record's notes are outside all of this, and issue #339 widened what
	 *         that costs.</b> Such a record is injected because a drug is an active order, with no
	 *         interaction chip behind it (see {@code collect}), and it renders its OWN entry's rules —
	 *         {@code Interaction} objects no chip carries — so the identity test above never matches and
	 *         every one of its notes falls back to {@code partnerLabel}. That was harmless while an
	 *         unfolded chip printed {@code partnerLabel} too; since #339 it does not, so one prompt can
	 *         carry one prescription under two names across two records. Measured through the real
	 *         {@code injectRecords} over the pinned excerpt, a patient on Warfarin, Acetylsalicylic acid
	 *         and Digoxin asked {@code "Can I give her ibuprofen?"}: the in-play {@code Ibuprofen} record
	 *         lists {@code Warfarin}, the order-driven {@code Acetylsalicylic acid} record lists
	 *         {@code warfarin}, and before #339 both read {@code warfarin}. <b>It is not a corner, which
	 *         one example reads as</b> — measured at review round 9 over 200 synthetic arrangements
	 *         of the shipped knowledge base driven through the real {@code injectRecords} (the first 200
	 *         entries publishing two interaction tokens that resolve to another substance, each charted
	 *         as up to three of those partners as active orders): one prompt names one substance two ways
	 *         in 20 of them, against 2 of 200 at the merge base. None of them is a false claim. ADR
	 *         Decision 63's trade-off bullet carries the arrangement, the split by shape and the caveat,
	 *         and this paragraph does not restate them. Closing it means keying this
	 *         lookup on the PARTNER rather than on rule identity, which needs the partner entry to travel
	 *         beside the name — a change to what a {@link SafetyWarning} carries, not to this scan — and
	 *         it re-opens the key-dependence question the condition below exists for. Recorded in ADR
	 *         Decision 63's trade-offs rather than taken here.
	 *
	 *         <p>A linear scan of a list bounded by the chips this response raised, and deliberately not
	 *         a map: the accessor above will not hand out a name without being shown the rule it was
	 *         decided on, and a map keyed here would have to read the rule back out to build itself.
	 *
	 * @param findings the pre-answer chips, or an empty list when the {@code drugSafety} toggles are off
	 *        — in which case there is no chip for this note to agree with and it keeps its own label,
	 *        which is the same gating {@code preAnswerFindings} already applies to the record's
	 *        contraindication reading (issue #208 item 2)

	 *         {@code bestRulePerPartner} falls back to and the very string this record prints, so the
	 *         grouping and the rendering cannot come to disagree about what one partner is. A rule
	 *         carrying NEITHER a token nor an ATC code keys on itself: it renders as a bare note with no
	 *         name to group on, and merging two such rows would silently drop one operator-authored
	 *         paragraph in favour of another. The three key spaces cannot collide — a
	 *         {@link DrugReference} and an {@link DrugReference.Interaction} define no {@code equals}, and
	 *         neither can ever equal a {@link String}.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Why the tail stays on the LABEL, and why that is not the text-keying issue #173 ruled
	 *         out.</b> Every chip-side ledger keys on identity because a key made of rendered text rots
	 *         when the rendering changes, so this looks like the exception and is worth settling once
	 *         rather than re-litigating. Three things settle it.
	 *         <ul>
	 *           <li>There is usually no identity to be had. Every partner in the dataset tail, which is
	 *               where nearly all the surplus above lives, resolves to no active order, so for them
	 *               the chip's own key IS the label. Keying the tail on an entry would mean resolving
	 *               each partner token across the whole dataset, which is a THIRD resolution rather than
	 *               a port of the chip's.</li>
	 *           <li>It would not be safer, it would be less safe. {@code identifies} resolves through
	 *               an entry's alias list and its ATC codes, and the shipped KB shares both across
	 *               entities the dataset itself files as separate drugs. Measured 2026-08-07 over the
	 *               19 MB KB by calling that predicate: on 397 of 2283 entries, 487 notes, two rules
	 *               with DIFFERENT labels resolve to ONE entry — {@code trastuzumab} with
	 *               {@code trastuzumab deruxtecan}, {@code isosorbide} with
	 *               {@code isosorbide mononitrate}, {@code moderna covid-19 vaccine} with
	 *               {@code sars-cov-2 (covid-19) vaccine, mrna spike protein}. In a CHIP that
	 *               over-merge costs one duplicate and the survivor is still the most severe rule; in
	 *               a RECORD it costs a partner its name, and this record is the only place the tail
	 *               is named at all. Dropping a partner is the direction this module does not take.</li>
	 *           <li>What #173 ruled out was keying on an ASSEMBLED SENTENCE — the screening arm's
	 *               {@code (type, drug, detail)} triple, which stopped recognising a repeat the moment
	 *               either arm reworded its chip (see {@code DrugSafetyValidator.InteractionPairs}). A
	 *               partner's own coalesced, trimmed name is not that: it is the atomic unit of the
	 *               grouping, and issue #121's invariant — the key IS what the RECORD says — is
	 *               deliberate rather than incidental. <b>Since issue #297 that second half is scoped for
	 *               this record exactly as issue #292 scoped it for the chip</b>: on the no-entry branch
	 *               the key is still {@code partnerLabel} case-folded, while a partner the
	 *               reconciliation answered for can RENDER that answer here. Issue #339 widened which
	 *               partners those are — every rule chip's, not only a folded one's — so a note
	 *               rendering this key is now the case where the reconciliation declined rather than the
	 *               case where no class sentence folded. The grouping is unaffected, running before the
	 *               note is worded and on that key. (On the other branch {@link #onePerPartner} keys on
	 *               the ENTRY, and that is the branch the entry rung reconciles on — so it rendered
	 *               {@code partnerLabel} beside an entry key until issue #297, and now renders the
	 *               reconciled name there. Which is issue #190 item 2's residue seen from the other side,
	 *               the paragraph below it.) The chip half of that invariant is scoped since issue #292
	 *               and finished by issue #339 (see
	 *               {@code DrugSafetyValidator.reconciledPartnerName}); this key is not, and does not
	 *               follow the chip's rendered name — the KEY does not, though since issue #297 the
	 *               rendered NAME does.</li>
	 *         </ul>
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Issue #190 item 2</b> is the residue the label key left where an identity WAS to be
	 *         had: two rules naming ONE of the patient's own orders under two of its names — issue #136's
	 *         {@code warfarin}/{@code coumadin}, one entry reached by two aliases — were two notes beside
	 *         a single chip, because the chip had already keyed them on that entry. Taking the chip's own
	 *         answer closes it without buying any of the 397-entry over-merge above: that measurement is
	 *         a property of resolving a partner across the WHOLE dataset, and this resolution is bounded
	 *         by the patient's active orders. Where it does merge two labels, the chip merged them first
	 *         and the record now agrees with it — which is the invariant, not a cost.
	 *
	 *         <p>Applied over EVERY rule rather than only over the promoted ones, deliberately: the
	 *         floor decides which rules are worth PROMOTING, while a sub-floor row stays in the tail
	 *         (see the caller — at its head where the chart names the partner, in dataset position
	 *         where it does not, since issue #357; and in SEVERITY order rather than dataset order
	 *         where the chart names no partner of this entry at all, since issue #355), so collapsing
	 *         only the promoted half would leave a sub-floor row of a partner in the tail beside that
	 *         partner's promoted row — the same partner twice, which is what this removes. Staying is
	 *         the whole of the premise, and it is all the premise needs. (The survivor rule below does
	 *         READ the floor, through {@link #renderTier}; what it does not do is filter the input by
	 *         it.)
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Which row wins, and why the render tier is asked FIRST.</b> Running before the
	 *         segments are built means the survivor rule decides which row's {@code (token, ATC)} pair
	 *         {@link #renderTier} is then asked about — so the survivor must be a row of the earliest
	 *         tier the group can reach, or the collapse can push a partner OUT of the
	 *         segment that overrides {@link #MAX_INTERACTION_RENDER_CHARS} and, with another partner
	 *         promoted and only one tail representative rendered, out of the record altogether. That
	 *         is {@link DrugSafetyValidator#bestRulePerPartner}'s behaviour reproduced rather than a
	 *         rule of its own: it never sees a non-matching row at all, having filtered on
	 *         {@code hasActiveDrug} before it groups. Within a TIER the order is
	 *         {@link DrugSafetyValidator#outranksOnRule}, so the promoted note is the row the chip
	 *         quotes. <b>Across tiers it is not, and since issue #357 that is visible rather than
	 *         vacuous</b>: where a partner's rows split so that the chart names one and not another,
	 *         this elects the row the chart names even when a sibling the chart does not name is rated
	 *         MORE severely — the less severe row wins, because the question this collapse answers is
	 *         which row decides where the partner sits, and a row about a drug nobody is taking cannot
	 *         answer it. {@code InjectedInteractionRelevanceOrderTest.theCollapseKeepsTheRowTheChartNamesEvenWhereTheFloorFilteredBoth}
	 *         is that case.
	 *         The floor cannot change a winner on its own — a group's most severe row clears the floor
	 *         whenever any of its rows does, since {@code severityPriority} ranks unrated highest and
	 *         is otherwise monotone in the rank the floor compares — so it is the
	 *         {@code hasActiveDrug} half of {@link #renderTier} that does the work, at BOTH of the
	 *         boundaries that half now draws: promoted against everything, since issue #174 site 2,
	 *         and, since issue #357, the head of the tail against the rest of it, where two sub-floor
	 *         rows of one partner answer it differently and the loser would take the partner out of
	 *         the record. No shipped dataset can make either: {@code ddinter} writes every rule's ATC
	 *         from its partner row, and measured 2026-08-07 through the real parser, 0 of the 19 MB
	 *         KB's label groups hold rows differing on either field. A hand-authored file reaches it
	 *         immediately, which is the same latency issue #174 site 4 is guarded at.
	 *
	 *         <p>A {@link LinkedHashMap}, so replacing a group's winner does not move the partner's
	 *         position — dataset order within each of the caller's two tail segments is what its
	 *         javadoc guarantees, and the segments themselves are a partition of this iteration order
	 *         rather than a re-sort of it. The one exception is issue #355's sort of the LAST segment
	 *         where the two ahead of it are empty; that sort is STABLE, so this order is still what
	 *         decides partners tied on severity there.

	 * caps how many tail partners it names.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why naming is asked FIRST, and why the key is not visible in the promoted segment.</b> A

	 * falls back to its whole mechanism paragraph — and being operator-authored it is normally
	 * unrated, which this comparator ranks above Major. Ordering the tail on severity alone therefore
	 * hoisted such a paragraph into the first slot, the one {@code render} lets past the character
	 * budget so that at least one interaction is always shown, and it crowded out the row that named a
	 * partner. Measured by removing this first key and running
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjectorTest.aTailRuleWithNoPartnerToNameDoesNotDisplaceOneThatDoes} over
	 * {@code drug-reference-unpromoted-tail-nameless.json}, re-measured 2026-09-02 on the tree that
	 * merges issue #357's three-segment partition: the rendered interactions section is <b>35</b>
	 * characters naming metformin with the key ({@code withheldInteractions} 1) and <b>1548</b> without
	 * it, all of them a paragraph about a partner nobody can identify — the cost issue #355 exists to
	 * remove, reintroduced by its own fix. Both figures are that one fixture's; the shape was first found
	 * on a differently sized one, so re-measure rather than carrying either number across. The tail's job is breadth; a rule that names
	 * nobody states none, so it may not outrank one that does. In the PROMOTED segment the key cannot
	 * fire, and the two ends of that argument read the SAME pair of fields: the flag is
	 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#partnerLabel}'s answer about the rule — a
	 * {@code firstNonBlank(token, atc)}, so null exactly when neither field yields a non-blank string,
	 * which is a BLANK one as much as an absent one — while {@link #renderTier}'s promoted tier requires
	 * {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasActiveDrug}, whose name arm skips a blank token and whose last
	 * line is an ATC lookup that fails on an absent code. A rule this key demotes is therefore one
	 * {@code hasActiveDrug} answers false for, so it was never promoted, and it can carry no chip
	 * either — {@link DrugSafetyValidator#bestRulePerPartner} gates on that same conjunction. Nothing
	 * this key drops is a partner a chip could name.
	 *
	 * <p>Two keys, and the composition is still a total order — lexicographic over a boolean and an
	 * {@code int} — so no input can make {@code Collections.sort} raise
	 * {@code "Comparison method violates its general contract!"} on the large partner lists the shipped
	 * knowledge base carries.
	 *
	 * <p>Which source a rule came from decides whether that branch is reachable at all: DDInter rates
	 * every row (all 295,184 in the full KB are Major/Moderate/Minor/Unknown — none unrecognised), so
	 * unrated arises only from an operator's curated JSON. A mixed deployment is therefore the only

		 *  one — {@code DrugReference.Interaction.setToken} normalises nothing, so a JSON
		 *  {@code "token": " "} arrives blank.
		 *
		 *  <p><b>Asked of the RULE in the constructor, not handed in.</b> The property stated
		 *  positively: this flag is {@code partnerLabel}'s own answer about the rule this note renders,
		 *  arrived at the same way {@link #severityPriority} is, so the construction site passes no
		 *  boolean and no name for it and has nothing to derive. It WAS a {@code boolean} parameter,
		 *  and each review round of issue #355 found one more re-derivation written in its place that
		 *  the whole build accepted — the five listed below, each a different question. Do not
		 *  reintroduce a caller-supplied flag, and do not hand the label over as a {@code String}
		 *  instead: the severity local sits beside it at the call site and is type-compatible with
		 *  such a parameter, so the last of the five would still be expressible there.
		 *
		 *  <p><b>Moving the read here removed the CALL-site re-derivations and not the family</b>, and
		 *  the paragraph above claimed otherwise until review round 6 falsified it: none of the five
		 *  can be written where the note is constructed any more, but each can still be written on
		 *  the line below, and round 6 found a sixth that was —
		 *  {@code rule.getAtc() != null || firstNonBlank(rule.getToken()) != null}, the raw-presence
		 *  reading applied to the ATC arm alone. Written into the constructor it left the whole build
		 *  green, measured in that round and again here; the JSON fixture corpus carried no
		 *  blank-but-present {@code atc} for it to differ on. So what bounds the family is not
		 *  a case per substitution but a case over the rule SHAPES this predicate can distinguish:
		 *  {@code DrugReferenceInjectorTest.everyRuleShapeThatNamesAPartnerLeadsANamelessParagraphAndEveryOtherShapeTrailsIt},
		 *  over {@code drug-reference-unpromoted-tail-name-shapes.json}. {@code partnerLabel} is a
		 *  {@code firstNonBlank} over two fields, so what it can distinguish is the 3×3 product of
		 *  {absent, blank, non-blank} over them; the fixture files one entry per cell — the nine are
		 *  enumerated in that case's own comment — plus the three naming cells with no blank field
		 *  again with no note, and the case asserts of each whether its row or a nameless unrated
		 *  paragraph is the one the record shows.
		 *
		 *  <p><b>Review round 7 found that matrix filing seven of the nine cells</b>, both MIXED cells
		 *  missing, and each of the two admitted an inlining of {@code partnerLabel} the whole build
		 *  accepted: the "take the first PRESENT field, then blank-check it" reading differs from
		 *  {@code partnerLabel} exactly on (blank token, non-blank ATC), and the same reading with its
		 *  arms swapped exactly on (non-blank token, blank ATC). Both were measured on this branch
		 *  with the nine cells filed: red, and the only failing case in the whole build is that one, at
		 *  the newly-filed cell — so nothing else in the build sees either reading. That case now also
		 *  asserts every cell of the product is FILED, not merely that every filed cell is asserted —
		 *  the latter is structurally silent on a cell nobody wrote, which is how round 6 came to claim
		 *  a closed family over an open one. The five cases below are NOT subsumed by it
		 *  and stay: every probe row in the matrix is UNRATED, so that only the naming key can order
		 *  it against the paragraph, and a re-derivation admitting a NAMELESS but RATED row — {@code
		 *  partnerLabel(rule) != null || firstNonBlank(rule.getSeverity()) != null}, measured to leave
		 *  the matrix green — differs on a shape no probe here carries. What holds that shape is
		 *  {@code .aNamelessRuleCarryingASeverityStillDoesNotDisplaceARowThatNamesItsPartner}.
		 *
		 *  <p><b>Why the rule answers exactly what the call site used to.</b>
		 *  {@link #orderedInteractionNotes} renders under {@code reconciledPartnerNoteName}, which is a
		 *  chip's own name for the partner where one reconciled and {@code partnerLabel} otherwise — so
		 *  it is non-null wherever {@code partnerLabel} is. It is also null wherever
		 *  {@code partnerLabel} is: a rule that method names nothing for is one
		 *  {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasActiveDrug} answers false for — its name arm skips a blank
		 *  token and its last line is an ATC lookup that fails on an absent code — so no chip about it
		 *  can exist to carry a reconciled name, which is the same conjunction
		 *  {@link #SEVERITY_DESCENDING} reads for the other half of its own argument. The two are
		 *  therefore null together, which is what keeps this flag false exactly where {@link #compact}
		 *  falls back to the whole mechanism paragraph for want of a name to shorten to.
		 *
		 *  <p><b>The five re-derivations, and what each costs.</b> Comparing {@code compact} to
		 *  {@code full} fails because the two coincide for a SECOND reason: a row carrying a severity
		 *  but no mechanism text renders full as just its name, and {@code name (Severity)} is longer
		 *  than that, so the never-grow guard in {@link #orderedInteractionNotes} resets
		 *  {@code compact} to it — while the row DOES name its partner. Reading one field of the pair
		 *  ({@code firstNonBlank(i.getToken()) != null}) drops the ATC arm, and reading their raw
		 *  presence ({@code i.getToken() != null || i.getAtc() != null} — the inlining of
		 *  {@code partnerLabel} minus its blank handling) reports a name for a row that method gives
		 *  none for. So does the severity beside it ({@code severity != null}), which asks a different
		 *  question entirely; and that same severity test conjoined with the name reports FALSE for a
		 *  row that names a partner and carries no rating — the shape of all five interaction rows of
		 *  the curated dataset this module itself ships
		 *  ({@code api/src/main/resources/chartsearchai/drug-reference.json}, each carrying a token, an
		 *  ATC code and no {@code severity}) and the normal shape of a hand-authored rule. Each of
		 *  those either loses a named partner out of the record or lands a paragraph naming nobody in
		 *  the slot the character budget cannot refuse — as does the sixth reading named above, which
		 *  is the raw-presence one applied to the ATC arm and only to it. Write each one into the
		 *  constructor and read the failures, among them
		 *  {@code DrugReferenceInjectorTest.aRatedRowWithNoMechanismTextStillCountsAsNamingItsPartner},

	 *         <p><b>The body now lives on {@link DrugSafetyValidator#corroboratedByTheChart}</b>, which
	 *         this delegates to, and the reasoning below is what that method points back at. It moved
	 *         for one reason: since issue #308 the injected {@code safety_finding} asks this same
	 *         question, and it is decided in the arm that BUILDS that finding — so a second copy here
	 *         would let the two records of one chart come apart again, which is precisely what #308
	 *         measured the cost of. The lazy memo is preserved across the move by handing the reading's
	 *         own accessor rather than its value, so leg 2's dataset sweep still happens only where
	 *         leg 1 fails.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>The UNION of two questions, and neither half will do.</b> A rule whose token is one
	 *         of its own entry's drug NAMES reaches the allergy list through
	 *         {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasAllergyToken}'s bare containment — deliberately bare,
	 *         because a curated token may name a CLASS or a fragment of free text — so {@code opium}
	 *         matches an allergen recorded as {@code Tiotropium} and the record used to say the chart
	 *         records a documented opium allergy. Either of two things redeems that match:
	 *         {@link DrugSafetyValidator#aMatchedRecordNamesTheEntry}, the chip rank's own predicate,
	 *         and {@link DrugSafetyValidator#allergicSubstanceKeys}, the allergen arm's identity
	 *         question over the whole allergy list.
	 *
	 *         <p>Each alone is wrong, in opposite directions, which is why this takes both:
	 *         <ul>
	 *           <li>the rank's predicate alone UNDERSTATES. It is per WITNESS of the rule that fired, and
	 *               {@code papaveretum} does not contain {@code opium} — so a patient allergic to
	 *               papaveretum and, separately, to tiotropium has a genuine opium allergy the allergen
	 *               arm chips, and the record would have hedged it.</li>
	 *           <li>the allergen arm's set alone OVERSTATES.
	 *               {@link DrugReferenceService#findImpliedSubstances} admits equal claimants only at the
	 *               strongest claimant's rank, so an allergy recorded as {@code Ketoconazole} reaches the
	 *               entry CALLED that and not one merely aliasing it — and a self-named rule on the
	 *               aliasing entry keeps the full {@code SELF_NAMED_RULE} chip rank while the record
	 *               would have hedged it. It is also why the third section's lead states what the module
	 *               established rather than a categorical about the chart — see
	 *               {@link #UNCORROBORATED_READING_LEAD}. That is the cost
	 *               {@code DrugSafetyValidator.contraindicationRank} records against swapping its own
	 *               predicate for this one, reached from the other side.</li>
	 *         </ul>
	 *         The union is MONOTONE, which is the whole argument for it: it can hedge nothing either
	 *         half admits, so it can neither understate a recorded allergy nor disagree with a chip
	 *         standing at full rank. Asked in cost order — the rank's predicate reads only the context
	 *         and the entry, so the dataset sweep happens only where it fails.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>The two legs above are scoped to a self-named allergy rule</b>, exactly as the
	 *         chip's demotion is, and that is load-bearing rather than incidental: an ALLERGY rule whose
	 *         token is NOT one of its entry's names is asking about a class or about free text, which is
	 *         what the bare match exists for, and neither of those questions can speak to it. The shipped
	 *         seed's {@code nsaid} rule is such a rule and the allergen arm resolves nothing at all from
	 *         an allergy recorded as {@code NSAIDs}, so an unscoped reading would hedge a correct clause.
	 *         Tightening the MATCH instead was measured and declined — see
	 *         {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasAllergyToken}.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>A CONDITION rule is corroborated by a third leg that is neither of them</b> (issue
	 *         #309): {@code DrugSafetyValidator.aMatchedConditionCarriesTheToken}, which asks whether a
	 *         matched record carries the token as a WHOLE WORD. It is a boundary rather than a
	 *         resolution, because no arm resolves a recorded condition to a substance — so the two legs
	 *         above genuinely cannot serve it, and the answer was to ask a different question rather
	 *         than to widen theirs. Its own measurement and residue are on that method and on
	 *         {@link PatientClinicalContext#containsToken}.

	 *
	 * <p>The chart comes off {@code reading}, and so does the AGE derived from it — neither is a
	 * parameter, because a second source for either lets one record's dose bands and its patient reading
	 * describe different patients. It orders the capped {@code Interactions:} section — see
	 * {@link #orderedInteractionNotes} — and it splits the contraindication list into what this patient's
	 * chart records, what it does not, and (issue #269) what it matched but nothing corroborates (issue
	 * #208 item 2, {@link #contraindicationSections}). It may be null, which is "nothing known about the
	 * patient": nothing is then promoted, so the interactions section is entirely the tail — most
	 * severe first and bounded by {@link #MAX_TAIL_PARTNERS_WHEN_NOTHING_PATIENT_SPECIFIC} since issue #355 — and the
	 * contraindication list is rendered with no reading at all, because a record that cannot see the
	 * chart must not report an absence.
	 *
	 * <p>{@code orderEntries} stays a parameter and is NOT a counter-example to that: the context is
	 * BUILT from it ({@code withReferenceNames} at the call site), so there is nothing to re-derive here
	 * and re-resolving it per record is the second resolution CLAUDE.md's {@code findForActiveOrders}
	 * bullet refuses. It is passed straight through to the interactions method, which groups a partner
	 * the patient is on by the entry it resolves to (issue #190 item 2).
	 *
	 * <p>Private because {@code injectRecords} is the only caller. That is the whole reason: a
	 * package-private signature would let a caller outside this class pass a null reading — measured,
	 * a call passing a null for every parameter compiles the moment the modifier is dropped, since none
	 * of the five names a private type — and it would NPE on {@code reading.context()}. Re-measure by
	 * dropping the modifier rather than by counting the nulls here: the arity was four until issue #297
	 * added {@code findings}, and the count went stale in that change before review caught it.
	 *
	 * <p>{@code substance} is what this row's own fields cannot say: the rows of its substance the pass
	 * resolved, and which of them THIS RESPONSE names the substance by — the caller's
	 * {@link #matchingEntries} answers, not anything re-derived here, because both are facts about the
	 * whole row GROUP and this method holds one row of it (see {@link SubstanceRendering}). They feed
	 * {@link #rowAttribution} and {@link #otherRowDosing} and nothing else: for a one-row substance whose
	 * chart says nothing — every entry of every bundled dataset — this method's output is byte-identical
	 * to what it produced before issues #237/#259.

			// model reading that list whole and reporting the stranger as one of her interactions) —
			// with one operator-authored exception, since
			// InteractionNote keeps the full text for a rule carrying no token and no ATC (there is no
			// name to shorten to), so such a row can still land a full paragraph in this slot. That
			// stays inside this segment's own one-note overshoot; it just is not always ~20 chars.
			//
			// With NOTHING patient-specific the same compact form is used, for up to
			// MAX_TAIL_PARTNERS_WHEN_NOTHING_PATIENT_SPECIFIC of them (issue #355). Until it this branch
			// spent the whole budget on full notes, on the rationale that the general material IS the
			// record's content when nothing is patient-specific — which the reproduction on that issue
			// falsifies: "Can I give this patient Metformin for diabetes?" is patient-specific, and what
			// 1500 characters bought was mechanism prose about the head of an alphabetical list, which
			// the model recited. The count differs from the other branch's ONE because the tail is then
			// the whole record and one name would read as this drug's only interaction; see that
			// constant. The rules are ordered most severe first for this branch and only this one, in
			// orderedInteractionNotes, so the cap does not evict the entry's worst partner.
			//
			// The budget still bounds the loop, because the operator-authored exception above applies
			// to each of those rows too: a labelless rule contributes a paragraph rather than a name, and
			// the cap counts rules rather than characters.
			// And the first piece still renders however long it is: the pre-existing "at least one
			// interaction is always shown" guarantee.
			//
			// The condition is "anything patient-specific", not "anything promoted", and issue #357 is
			// why it has to be: with the promoted count alone, a record whose only chart-named partner
			// was floor-filtered took the branch meant for a record with nothing patient-specific to
			// say, and the breadth this segment exists to supply was never rendered at all.
			//
			// MAX_INTERACTION_RENDER_CHARS is a soft budget, and say what actually bounds the
			// overshoot rather than counting notes: the two patient-specific segments are bounded by
			// the patient's own active-drug list and NOT by the budget — neither drops a member, which
			// is what "never invisible" means — and this one adds at most one note on top. So a chart
			// with many of an entry's own partners on it overshoots by however many those are, and none
			// of them is withheld — that is the same trade segment 1 has always made, extended to a

	 *         Measured 2026-08-14 over the shipped 19 MB KB through the real {@code injectRecords} and
	 *         the real {@code validate}: 104 of its 129 multi-row substances, being every one that could
	 *         be posed with both a record and a chip. Re-measure before relying on the figure.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>#259 is the same split reaching a NUMBER</b>, and a number is worse: the record
	 *         renders the canonical row's age band, so a clinician reading the cited record sees

	 *         name, for which "for X, not for X" is a contradiction shown to a clinician.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>NOT gated on the {@code drugSafety.*} switches</b>, which is the opposite of the
	 *         patient-specific reading rendered a few lines above it and so has to be said rather than
	 *         left to look like an oversight. Issue #208's reading ADDS a claim about the patient and is
	 *         the record's half of a chip, so with the chips off it would be prose with no chip and it
	 *         stands down with them ({@link #statesTheChartsContraindicationReading}). This clause does
	 *         the reverse: it NARROWS a claim the record makes anyway — the ceiling, the notes and the

	 *         the UNCORRECTED sentence whenever the switch is off, which is issue #259 reachable by

	 *
	 *         <p><b>Issue #259, the numeric half.</b> {@link #rowAttribution} says WHICH row a record
	 *         describes, which settles a name. It does not settle a NUMBER: the record rendered one row's
	 *         band alone while {@code DrugSafetyValidator.addOverdose} reads the band of the subject row
	 *         AND of every sibling — so a response could carry {@code maximum 3000 mg/day} as its citable
	 *         reference beside a chip warning at another row's 2000, and a clinician reading the record
	 *         had no route to the number the warning used. The asymmetry is the defect rather than either
	 *         surface's choice of row, so the record is given the row set the chips already fold. No row's
	 *         turn to be RENDERED changes — that was measured and declined (see {@link #rowAttribution}).
	 *
	 *         <p><b>The guard is deliberately NOT {@link DrugSafetyValidator#worthNamingApart}</b>, which
	 *         {@link #rowAttribution} shares with {@code DrugSafetyValidator.ceilingAttribution}. That
	 *         predicate asks whether CONTRASTING two rows would say anything, and "for X, not for X" is a
	 *         contradiction. This is an ENUMERATION under a lead that already says these are other rows,
	 *         so an item whose name folds to the record's own still says something actionable — a
	 *         different number — and staying silent there would keep the defect in the one dataset shape
	 *         where the chip's own attribution is also silent, i.e. where this record is the reader's only
	 *         route to the ceiling. Asking one question with the other's predicate is the conflation
	 *         CLAUDE.md's ATC bullet forbids, one feature along; the name is checked for BLANKNESS only,
	 *         which is the degradation every section of this record takes on an operator-editable dataset.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>What bounds it, each bound load-bearing.</b> Only where the dataset declared these
	 *         rows one substance ({@link DrugReference#substanceKey()} non-null) — the {@code getId()}
	 *         fallback groups rows a file never called one substance, and "other rows of this substance"
	 *         would then claim that about a number. Only bands matching the patient's age, which is the
	 *         record's existing rule and not a new one ({@code config.xml}: a pediatric maximum is never
	 *         surfaced for an adult query). Only rows whose numbers DIFFER from the rendered row's,
	 *         compared as the strings this record would print — so "differs" means "would say something
	 *         different" rather than "differs in a double", and a substance whose rows agree pays nothing.
	 *         And only the rows THIS PASS resolved, never a walk of the dataset: a record is not a
	 *         formulary, and issue #163 exists because near-duplicate row material crowds the chart out of
	 *         the prompt.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Why DOSING crosses rows here while interaction PARTNERS do not.</b> The two look like
	 *         an inconsistency and are not: {@code RenderedReference.withheldInteractions} records that a
	 *         partner carried only by a sibling row is absent from this record, and it stays absent. What
	 *         separates them is size, which is issue #163's whole subject — one sibling's dosing is one
	 *         clause, while a sibling's partner list is the thing that reaches
	 *         {@link #MAX_INTERACTION_RENDER_CHARS} on its own (the {@code ddinter} source's Warfarin row
	 *         publishes ~934). Widening this to partners would spend the budget #163 exists to protect;
	 *         that is the reason, and not that a sibling's partners would be less true.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>The phrasing is load-bearing outside this class, and newly so.</b> The model may recite
	 *         a record it is told to cite, so a ceiling here can arrive back in the ANSWER that
	 *         {@code DrugSafetyValidator} parses for a prescribed dose. Its {@code LIMIT_CUE} reads a
	 *         number as a ceiling only when a cue ({@code maximum}, {@code up to}, {@code no more than} …)
	 *         sits BEFORE it, so every number here keeps the {@code "maximum N mg/day"} order the rendered
	 *         row's own sentence uses; written {@code "N mg/day max"} a recited ceiling becomes a stated
	 *         dose.
	 *
	 *         <p>Why that guard did not matter before and does now: dose attribution is CLAUSE-scoped and
	 *         alias-anchored, and the rendered row's dosing sentence carries no drug name, so its ceiling
	 *         is attributed to nobody however it is worded. An item here is the first sentence THIS CLASS
	 *         composes that pairs a row's NAME with a published ceiling inside one clause — dataset free
	 *         text can of course pair anything, and always could. It always pairs a row with its OWN
	 *         ceiling, so
	 *         the figure can exceed something only where the SUBJECT row is a different row publishing a
	 *         stricter one — measured, not argued: mutating {@code maximum} out of {@code LIMIT_CUE} left
	 *         this file green until a fixture pair shaped that way existed, and then produced
	 *         {@code "The stated Nitrofurantoin dose ~200 mg/day exceeds the 100 mg/day maximum"} from a
	 *         record nobody had prescribed anything from.
	 *         {@code ReferenceRecordSubstanceCeilingsTest.aRecitedRecordIsReadAsCeilingsAndNotAsADose}
	 *         feeds this record back through the real {@code validate} and is what pins it.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>The residue, stated rather than discovered.</b> The chips' post-answer pass can also
	 *         resolve rows the ANSWER's own wording names, which no pre-answer record can carry — it is
	 *         written before the answer exists. So this closes every shape reachable from the pass that
	 *         writes the record, and the bound is the rows that pass resolved
	 *         ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.resolvedSubstanceRows}, which the ANSWER still widens
	 *         deliberately per issue #175). This used to cite
	 *         {@code DrugSafetyValidator.SubstanceSubjects} as recording the same bound, and since issue
	 *         #238 it no longer does: what a substance is CALLED is now folded over the question's and the
	 *         orders' rows alone, so the two passes no longer differ over the ANSWER when they name a
	 *         substance, while still differing over which rows are in play — which is the bound this
	 *         residue is about. "No longer differ over the answer" and not "agree": each pass reads the

	 *
	 * @param band the rendered row's own band for this patient, or null when it publishes none — in which

	 *         rendered clause, the same one the three sections below have resolved over since issue
	 *         #308, so what this record treats as one statement it treats as one statement in both
	 *         places.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Not containment, and what that leaves standing.</b> A key whose clause CONTAINS
	 *         another key's still renders both: where a key folds two rules its clause is the em-dash
	 *         JOIN, so {@code opioid reaction} beside {@code opioid reaction — other reaction} is two
	 *         clauses and stays two, with the shared words read twice. Reading the containment rule
	 *         across keys would be wrong twice over. It drops a genuinely distinct clause wherever one
	 *         operator note is a substring of another — {@code bleeding} inside {@code active
	 *         gastrointestinal bleeding} — dropping an instruction this record is the only place the
	 *         prompt carries. And where those two strings are in DIFFERENT sections, the shorter one is
	 *         not merely dropped from the LIST: {@link #inClauseOrder} then filters it out of its
	 *         SECTION as well, so a chart reading the module had established stops being stated at all,
	 *         silently. The witness is Levoketoconazole in {@code
	 *         drug-reference-collapsed-key-joined-clause.json}, whose {@code opioid reaction} clause is
	 *         RECORDED while the joined clause containing it is the hedge: put a containment rule over
	 *         {@code clauses} and its recorded section is gone. {@code
	 *         InjectedContraindicationClauseTest.aClauseAnotherKeyMerelyCONTAINSIsStillItsOwnClause}
	 *         asserts that section FIRST for this reason. The {@code contains} check
	 *         {@link DrugSafetyValidator#contraindicationClauses} makes is safe for the opposite reason:
	 *         it is WITHIN one key, where the two rows report one rule.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>What it does to the count beside the chips.</b> This entry's clause count can now be
	 *         LOWER than the number of contraindication chips it raises — two matched rules of different
	 *         keys carrying one note are two chips and one clause. {@code
	 *         InjectedContraindicationClauseTest}'s class javadoc is canonical for why that is not issue
	 *         #190 item 1 reversed.
	 *
	 *         <p>Both halves of issue #310 are pinned in that class —
	 *         {@code twoRulesOfOneEntrySharingANoteRenderThatClauseOnce} and
	 *         {@code aClauseTwoKeysRenderIsListedOnceWithAnotherClauseBetweenThem} for the list,
	 *         {@code aRecordStatingNoReadingStillRendersASharedNoteOnce} and {@code
	 *         aRecordWithNoPatientContextStillRendersASharedNoteOnce} for the list where no reading is
	 *         stated because the chart was not read or there is no context (issue #407) — the two
	 *         {@code drugSafety} switches are pinned in {@code
	 *         InjectedContraindicationReadingToggleContextTest} because they are global properties —
	 *         {@code aReadingSectionIsListedInTheDeduplicatedClausesOwnOrder} for the RECORDED section's
	 *         order and {@code theDenialAndTheHedgeAreListedInTheClausesOwnOrderToo} for the other two.
	 *         {@code clausesDifferingOnlyInCaseOrSpacingAreEachTheirOwnClause} and {@code
	 *         aClauseAnotherKeyMerelyCONTAINSIsStillItsOwnClause} hold the IDENTITY that de-duplication
	 *         uses. Mutate each and read the failures.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Curated-source-only</b>, by construction rather than by measurement: neither
	 *         {@code ddinter} nor {@code atc} publishes contraindications at all, so only an
	 *         operator-authored file can file one rule twice — and the bundled seed does not (its four
	 *         ibuprofen rows are four distinct keys: since issue #146 the self-named allergy one is the
	 *         substance and the other three are their own {@code (type, token)}), so no shipped
	 *         rendering moves. {@code InjectedContraindicationClauseTest} pins both halves.
	 *
	 *         <p>Issue #310's condition is WIDER — one note on two KEYS, rather than one rule authored
	 *         twice — so it needed its own measurement rather than the paragraph above. Driving
	 *         {@link DrugSafetyValidator#contraindicationClauses} over
	 *         {@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.curatedService().getAll()} and over
	 *         {@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.shippedEntries()} on 2026-09-11 found no entry in either
	 *         whose keys render a duplicate clause: the bundled curated seed publishes 10
	 *         contraindication rules over its 4 entries, and the bundled DDI knowledge base publishes
	 *         none at all over its 2283 entries. So no shipped rendering moves for this either — but that is a
	 *         fact about the DATA on that date, not a property of the code, and an operator file is
	 *         exactly what it does not cover.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Joined, not dropped</b>, and that is the deliberate difference from issue #174 site 2:
	 *         that collapse could discard a repeated row because the repeats were near-identical, while
	 *         two rows of one rule here carry two DIFFERENT operator-authored notes. The chip keeps only
	 *         the incumbent's (ties keep the incumbent, which
	 *         {@code ContraindicationRouteVariantTest.oneCuratedRuleAuthoredTwiceRaisesOneChip} pins), so
	 *         a record that dropped the sibling would remove that clinical instruction from the
	 *         deployment altogether — this record being the only place the prompt carries it. They are
	 *         joined with the em dash the module already attaches a note with, rather than with the
	 *         {@code "; "} that separates CLAUSES, so the join cannot read as a second contraindication.
	 *
	 *         <p>A rule whose note and token are both blank contributes nothing, exactly as before — the
	 *         dataset is operator-editable and every section must degrade to "skip that element" rather
	 *         than emit a literal {@code null}.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Issue #208 item 2 — and which of them the patient's chart records, in the same
	 *         walk.</b> This record is the only reference material the prompt carries about the drug, so
	 *         the list stays the drug's whole list; what it may not do is leave a model unable to tell
	 *         the drug's properties from this patient's, because a model reports what it can see and
	 *         since issue #110 this record is citable evidence. Measured live on the 3.7.1 standalone:
	 *         a patient with no such condition on record got a record reading "Contraindicated with: …
	 *         active gastrointestinal bleeding", with no chip beside it. The predicate is
	 *         {@link DrugSafetyValidator#recordedContraindicationKind}, the chip arm's own, for the same
	 *         reason the KEY here is the chip ledger's own; and a clause is marked when ANY rule folded
	 *         into it matched, which is when the ledger raises a chip for that key. Since issue #269 the
	 *         positive marking additionally needs {@link #corroborated} of that rule, and a matched rule
	 *         it refuses takes a third section rather than either half — so the walk resolves each key as
	 *         a MAX over its rules, one corroborated rule carrying the key. Selecting
	 *         from the clauses in this walk rather than recomputing them afterwards is what keeps the
	 *         marked strings a subset of the rendered ones by construction.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>"When", and no longer "exactly when".</b> Since the active-order contraindication
	 *         arm became subject-matter scoped, a record rendered for an order the response is NOT about
	 *         can mark a clause the ledger raises no chip for: {@link #matchingEntries} admits an order
	 *         that merely shares a class with a question-named drug, and such an entry is not in the
	 *         drugs-in-play set, so its chip goes through that scoping while this marking does not. The
	 *         marking is a statement about the CHART and stays true either way, which is why it is not
	 *         gated here as well — this record must not report an absence it cannot substantiate
	 *         (issue #208 item 2), and scoping it would make it do exactly that. What the residue costs
	 *         is stated at {@link #preAnswerFindings}, where the prompt-versus-chip channels are
	 *         enumerated; it is unreachable on any bundled dataset.
