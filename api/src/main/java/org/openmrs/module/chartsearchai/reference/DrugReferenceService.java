/**
 * Loads and indexes the drug-reference dataset. The data <em>layer</em> is
 * pluggable: the active {@link DrugReferenceSource} is selected by
 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#GP_DRUG_REFERENCE_SOURCE_FORMAT}
 * ({@code json} = the curated {@link JsonDrugReferenceSource}, {@code atc} = the
 * authoritative {@link AtcDrugReferenceSource}, {@code ddinter} = the DDInter-backed
 * {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}); each resolves its file from
 * {@link ChartSearchAiConstants#GP_DRUG_REFERENCE_DATA_FILE_PATH} through
 * {@link ReferenceDataFiles} — the {@code json} and {@code ddinter} formats with a bundled classpath
 * default behind it, {@code atc} with none, so that format runs on the operator's own export or runs
 * empty. This lets the
 * feature consume authoritative datasets by pointing at them, rather than
 * hand-maintaining a chartsearchai-specific file. See ADR Decision 24.
 *
 * <p>Loading is lazy and cached: the first lookup triggers a load, and the result
 * is held for the life of the bean. The same applies to the curated
 * {@link CrossReactivityGroup} dataset, which loads independently of the source
 * format. Editing either dataset — or switching the source format — therefore
 * requires a module restart.
 *
 * <p>Because it is lazy, "which dataset is in force?" cannot be answered from the log: the most
 * recent {@code "Loaded N …"} line may pre-date the global properties as they read now. Ask
 * {@link #getLoadStatus()} instead, which reports the load that populated the cache (performing it
 * if it has not happened yet) — see {@link DrugReferenceLoad} and the module's
 * {@code GET /chartsearchai/drugreferencestatus} endpoint.
 *
 * <p><b>Memoising anything derived from {@link #getAll()}: in a per-call LOCAL, never in a field.</b>
 * Issue #172's rule, and it binds every site that caches a resolution — here, in
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator} and in {@code DrugReferenceInjector}. Nine comments across those three
 * classes used to justify it by a {@code getAll()} hot-reload, and <b>issue #172's own text still
 * does</b> — which is why the reason is stated HERE, and why a {@code #172} pointer elsewhere in this
 * package that carries no reason of its own means this paragraph and not the issue. Two sites take the
 * same RULE for a reason of their own rather than for these — {@link DrugReferenceValidity} and the
 * local that builds one in {@code ensureLoaded} are per-LOAD collectors, not {@code getAll()} memos,
 * and each says so where it stands.
 *
 * <p>There is no such reload. Measured 2026-08-14, two ways: statically, {@code dataset} is written
 * only by {@code ensureLoaded()} when it is null and by the package-private {@code setEntries} test
 * seam, which has no production caller — the module registers no {@code GlobalPropertyListener} and
 * exposes no reload endpoint. That half is pinned in-suite, and has been since issue #154, by
 * {@code DrugReferenceLoadContextTest.loadStatusDoesNotDriftFromTheCachedEntriesWhenTheGlobalPropertiesChange}
 * — read it rather than re-measuring by hand, and rather than trusting a paraphrase of it here. Live,
 * flipping
 * {@code chartsearchai.drugReference.sourceFormat} from {@code ddinter} to {@code atc} on a running
 * server left {@code GET /chartsearchai/drugreferencestatus} reporting the DDInter entries it already
 * had and a {@code /search} still raising its chip, where a reload would have re-parsed the DDInter
 * file with the ATC parser, loaded nothing and dropped it. The "held for the life of the bean"
 * paragraph above is the accurate statement and always was: it has been there since {@code d15719cf},
 * the commit that added this class, and so predates every one of those nine comments — the earliest of
 * which arrived with issue #173.
 *
 * <p><b>The group LIST is the same shape; one group's PREFIXES are not, and the two must not be read
 * as one fact.</b> The field behind {@link #getCrossReactivityGroups()} is written once by
 * {@code ensureGroupsLoaded()} when it is null and otherwise only by test seams, so it does not reload
 * either — and since issue #266 that one write also publishes the load's own outcome
 * ({@link CrossReactivityGroupsLoad}), which is why they are ONE holder rather than two fields. But
 * {@link CrossReactivityGroup#setAtcPrefixes} is public API Jackson writes through, and it has to stay
 * authoritative after a membership question has been asked — so
 * {@link CrossReactivityGroup#containsAnyCode} keeps the reason stated in its own javadoc, not this
 * one. Same rule, different mechanism. (Issue #248's own statement of that reason opens with the same
 * reload error this paragraph retires; only its write-path half survives.)
 *
 * <p>Two reasons hold today, and a third is why the discipline is worth keeping rather than merely
 * defensible. These are Spring singletons, so a memo held in a field is one unsynchronized map shared
 * by every concurrent request — stale reads and lost updates possible, and a torn internal structure
 * possible. And some of these memos are keyed on something UNBOUNDED, which is what makes a field one
 * that grows for the life of the JVM: two of {@code DrugSafetyValidator.orderPartners}' four are keyed
 * on a per-request {@code PatientClinicalContext.ActiveDrugOrder} object, and {@code validate}'s
 * recorded-allergen list has no key at all, so a field version of it would have to key on the allergy
 * tokens — patient free text, and it would answer for whoever asked first. The other two are bounded
 * and only the singleton reason binds them: one by the dataset's own aliases (see
 * {@link #findImpliedByDrugName(String, Map)}) and one by the ATC code space.
 *
 * <p>And a module whose memos are all per call is one a reload path can be ADDED to later without
 * re-auditing every one of them — the honest version of the reload reason, and the one that cannot
 * rot.
 *
 * <p>{@code RecordedAllergenMemoScopeTest} pins ONE shape of this — a memo outliving the entries it was
 * resolved from — and before it nothing pinned even that. It does not pin the first reason above: a
 * single-threaded case cannot observe a structure being shared, and a field REASSIGNED once per pass
 * stays green on it. See that test's javadoc, which says so rather than leaving the rule looking better
 * defended than it is.

	 *
	 * <p><b>Why the boolean scan is not that answer (issue #209).</b> {@link #findByQuery} asks whether
	 * an entry is MENTIONED, which is a question about prose and is answered correctly. What its callers
	 * ask is which SUBSTANCES the text puts in play, and one alias is routinely shared by two of them:
	 * measured through the production predicates over the shipped 19 MB KB (2026-08-09; re-derive rather
	 * than trusting the figures), {@code matchesText("hydrocortisone")} is true for all four
	 * hydrocortisone rows while {@link DrugReference#nameMatchStrength} scores {@code Hydrocortisone} 2
	 * and {@code Hydrocortisone butyrate} 1 — a different substance, an ester the patient is not on. Live,
	 * that was a chip reading "Hydrocortisone butyrate is in the same ATC class (H02AB) as the patient's
	 * allergy to Dexamethasone" for a patient whose only order in the family is
	 * {@code Hydrocortisone Injection vial 100mg}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>How much it narrows</b>, measured by driving each of the 2283 published display names through
	 * this method and through {@link #findByQuery} (2026-08-09; re-derive rather than trusting the
	 * figures): 33 names resolve fewer rows, 71 rows in total, and the two invariants below hold for every
	 * one of the 2283 — nothing was emptied and no substance lost a row. The order-name leg
	 * ({@link #findImpliedByDrugName}) narrows by the same counts over the same corpus. Read the row total
	 * with its cause attached: 7 of those names and 42 of those rows are the single upstream data defect
	 * on issue #196, where {@code Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine} publishes
	 * {@code moderna covid-19 vaccine} among its aliases and all five {@code Tozinameran} rows inherit it.
	 * Excluding it the ranking moves 26 names and 29 rows, so most of the row total is one bad alias's
	 * consequences rather than a reshaping of clinical data.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why that is fewer names than issue #209 counted, and deliberately.</b> The issue measured a
	 * different question — how many display names the unranked scan admits a substance for that
	 * {@link #findImpliedSubstances} does not report for the WHOLE STRING — and got a larger figure. Both
	 * are correct; the gap is exactly the names where the whole-string rule would narrow and the
	 * name-CARRIED rule refuses to, which is the paragraph below and not a shortfall. Re-derive both
	 * before quoting either: they differ by roughly a factor of two on the shipped KB, so a reader
	 * comparing the issue's figure with this one will otherwise read a fix as incomplete.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The rule: the name CARRIED, not the whole text.</b> An entry stays when one of its own names
	 * that the text carries ({@link DrugReference#aliasesIn}) denotes its substance under
	 * {@link #findImpliedSubstances}. The witness is what makes this rankable at all — the text is prose
	 * and prose has no claim strength, while the alias by which an entry matched is exactly the kind of
	 * string {@code findImpliedSubstances} takes. It also keeps the narrowing about the CLAIM rather than
	 * about spans: a question naming {@code hydrocortisone butyrate} keeps the ester (which is named it
	 * outright) AND the parent substance (whose own name the string also carries), because neither name's
	 * resolution is affected by the other appearing beside it.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it cannot do.</b> It cannot empty a non-empty set. On the DDInter and ATC datasets that
	 * follows from the rule: an entry's carried alias resolves to some strongest claimant, that claimant
	 * carries the same alias and so is in the matched set, and {@code findImpliedSubstances} always
	 * answers with its substance first — so whatever the text most strongly names always survives. The
	 * middle step is a property of those PARSERS rather than of this filter, and a hand-authored
	 * {@code json} dataset can break it, so the invariant is ENFORCED in {@link #rowsOf} instead of being
	 * left to follow — see there for the shape and for why emptying is the one answer this must never
	 * give. And it drops whole SUBSTANCES only, never a row of one that
	 * survives: the verdict is taken per substance and then applied to every matched row of it. That
	 * second half is not decoration. A qualified row need not carry the alias its own family's bare row
	 * carries — {@code Estrone sulfate (topical)} publishes {@code estrone} as its {@code rxnorm_name},
	 * the OTHER substance's name, and nothing spelled {@code estrone sulfate} — so a per-row verdict
	 * dropped a presentation of a substance that was in play, and with it any rule sitting only on that
	 * presentation (measured over the shipped KB: one published name, before this was made per-substance).
	 *
	 * <p>Route/formulation variants are therefore kept, deliberately: they ARE the substance, and the arms
	 * downstream need the whole family — the dose arm tries each row for a published band, and
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.resolvedSubstanceRows} chooses one rule across all of them.

	 * screening a patient's orders need every row of each substance the name denotes.
	 *
	 * <p>Same rule and same reason as {@link #findImpliedByQuery} — see there — with the witness taken
	 * under the recorded-name boundary rule ({@link DrugReference#aliasesNaming}) rather than the prose
	 * one, so a localized display name still resolves: {@code Aspirine Co 81mg} carries {@code aspirin}
	 * here and nothing under the prose rule, which is issue #147.
	 *
	 * <p>The witness matters most sharply on this leg. A recorded order name is usually nobody's name —
	 * a display name with a strength appended — so the strongest claim on the WHOLE string is only
	 * {@link DrugReference#NAME_TOKEN_INSIDE_A_NAME}, at which rank {@code findImpliedSubstances}
	 * deliberately refuses to widen (see there) and answers with the earliest matching row alone.
	 * Filtering on that would discard genuinely-named substances — a combination order name would keep one
	 * ingredient and drop the rest, the direction issues #193/#195 exist to prevent. Resolving the name
	 * each row actually matched BY has no such edge: {@code Hydrocortisone Injection vial 100mg} carries
	 * {@code hydrocortisone}, which denotes one substance, while {@code Abacavir / lamivudine} carries
	 * {@code abacavir} for one row and {@code lamivudine} for the other and both stand.

	 * <p><b>The constraint on what this answer may be used FOR (issue #226).</b> This result may seed a
	 * CANDIDATE SET, where a superset costs a spurious candidate that a later rank filters out. It must

	 * silences a warning — with no chip, no log line and nothing for a clinician to notice. One accessor,
	 * two consumers whose safe direction of error is opposite; {@code DrugSafetyValidator}'s
	 * restating-existing-therapy skip has been the second kind since issue #185.
	 *
	 * <p>The over-report is not a missing rank, and that matters because it rules out the obvious fix.
	 * It is {@link #rowsOf}'s FAIL-OPEN, which is deliberate and pinned by
	 * {@code SubstanceCandidateSetTest.narrowingNeverEmptiesACandidateSetEvenWhenNoMatchedRowIsTheStrongestClaimant}:
	 * emptying a non-empty set means a question naming a drug gets no contraindication, no interaction and
	 * no overdose check at all, which is the silent-and-closed failure this whole layer exists to prevent.
	 * The {@code matched.size() < 2} early return above is that same fail-open's DEGENERATE case rather
	 * than a second shape — with one candidate there is nothing to rank, so ranking harder cannot narrow
	 * it. Giving a suppression a narrower answer therefore means a THIRD accessor, one allowed to return
	 * empty, plus a decision about what a suppression should do when it does.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What makes it safe today is the DATA, not this code.</b> The fallback's precondition is an
	 * entry whose {@code aliases} omit its own {@code name}; measured 2026-08-14 through
	 * {@link DrugReference#isNamed}, that holds for <b>0 of the 2283 entries</b> of the shipped 19 MB KB
	 * and 0 of each smaller bundled dataset, which makes the fallback unreachable for ANY input string on them
	 * rather than merely for a sampled population. It is a property of the PARSERS
	 * ({@link DdiDrugReferenceSource} makes the display name {@code alias[0]},
	 * {@link AtcDrugReferenceSource} makes it the only alias) and, since issue #150, of
	 * {@link DrugReferenceValidity}'s {@code sanitizeAliases}, which appends an entry's own name when it
	 * is missing — except, since issue #296, where that name is itself a string that names nothing, which
	 * it REPORTS instead of repairing, for the reason recorded there. So an entry left without a
	 * self-name IS constructible again, in a hand-authored file whose display name folds to nothing;
	 * what would make this reachable is a future DATASET, not a future caller — re-derive that count
	 * before relying on it. The narrowing is meanwhile doing real work and is not inert:
	 * measured the same way through this method, it removes a substance the string does not name on
	 * <b>276 of 29 808</b> order-name-shaped strings, {@code Hydrocortisone Injection vial 100mg} reaching

	 *
	 * <p><b>Why a third key.</b> The other two are both defeated by one ordinary shape — a dictionary
	 * concept the bridge records under one name while the deployment's locale elects another — and the
	 * concept the order was written against is the one key that does not depend on which of its names
	 * a session elects. ADR Decision 68 carries the case, its measurements and the alternatives that
	 * were rejected; it is not restated here.
	 *
	 * <p><b>RANKED, and that is not decoration.</b> The answer is the entries the bridge files under
	 * the concept INTERSECTED with the ones {@link #findImpliedByDrugName} answers for the name the
	 * bridge records for it. Both bounds are load-bearing and they fail in opposite directions.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What the ranking does.</b> It keeps only the entries making the STRONGEST claim on the
	 * bridge's own name. Where one entry's DISPLAY name is that name, that entry alone survives and the
	 * others are dropped — CIEL 85300 is filed on {@code Trastuzumab}, {@code Trastuzumab deruxtecan}
	 * and {@code Trastuzumab emtansine}, three drugbank ids sharing no ATC code, and resolves to the
	 * first. Unranked, that order would be the patient's own order for all three, and one consumer of
	 * this leg is a SUPPRESSION — {@code DrugSafetyValidator.activeOrdersOtherThan} withholds an order
	 * from witnessing an interaction — where a superset removes a warning with no chip and no log line
	 * to notice it by (see {@link #findImpliedByDrugName(String, Map)}'s own constraint).
	 *
	 * <p><b>What the ranking does NOT do, and the residue it leaves.</b> Where the bridge's name is
	 * only an ALIAS of its entries, {@link DrugReference#nameMatchStrength} TIES and
	 * {@link #findImpliedByDrugName} admits them all — so the leg can still answer with more than one
	 * substance. <b>1112 of the 4251 bridged concepts do</b> — measured through this method and
	 * {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()} over the shipped knowledge base, and asserted by
	 * {@code BridgedConceptLegBoundsTest.theRefusalsReachOverTheShippedKnowledgeBase} rather than
	 * quoted. Say what it is a count OF: bridged concepts whose answer spans more than one
	 * {@code substanceGroupKey}, with NO filter on the bridge name. A figure of 46 stood here, in
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator} and in ADR Decision 68 until review round 2; it was a count over the
	 * same population MINUS every bridge name that reads as a combination, and attaching it to the
	 * unfiltered predicate made the residue look like a 1-in-92 carve-out rather than the 1-in-4 it
	 * is. Among the 1112 are CIEL 77719 ({@code Hydrocortisone acetate} → Hydrocortisone AND
	 * Hydrocortisone butyrate) and CIEL 75876 ({@code Esomeprazole magnesium} → Esomeprazole AND
	 * Omeprazole), and also CIEL 103166 ({@code Abacavir / lamivudine} → Abacavir AND Lamivudine),
	 * which is a real fixed-dose combination and not an ambiguity at all. That is issue #209's own
	 * shape, and it is not narrowed here for the reason the next paragraph gives.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Part of it is refused at the one site that PRINTS an answer from it</b>, which is not the
	 * same thing as narrowing the leg: {@code DrugSafetyValidator.restsOnAnAmbiguousBridge} withholds
	 * the finding's "&lt;substance&gt; from &lt;prescription&gt;" clause for a substance the bridge's
	 * own recorded name does not NAME ({@link #substancesNamedByBridge}), where nothing but the bridge
	 * joined the order to it — because there the module would be saying which of several substances
	 * the prescription is. Per SUBSTANCE and not per concept: {@code Esomeprazole from Inexium 40mg}
	 * stands where {@code Omeprazole from Inexium 40mg} does not. The screen still runs and the chip
	 * still stands. Added in review round 1 after that clause was measured stating
	 * {@code Omeprazole from Inexium 40mg} for a prescription written against CIEL 75876, and narrowed
	 * in round 2 from "more than one substance" to this, which was refusing all 990 of the 1112 whose
	 * recorded name names every substance it resolves; ADR Decision 68 carries both.
	 *
	 * <p>Without the intersection the leg could reach an entry the bridge does not file under this
	 * concept at all, on the strength of a name it merely shares.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What the two bounds buy together, and why the residue above is not narrowed further:</b>
	 * the answer is a SUBSET of what a session electing the bridge's own spelling already gets today.
	 * So this leg states nothing the reference data does not already state about that concept — the 46
	 * are what an {@code en} session gets for those orders now — and it removes the dependence on WHICH
	 * spelling the session elects. Narrowing past that would make the leg answer LESS than the name leg
	 * it stands in for, which is the property that makes it defensible at all. What it inherits with
	 * that is the bridge's own defects: ADR Decision 36 records ~10 stray cross-walk rows in the
	 * shipped knowledge base, and this leg makes those locale-independent too. That is the trade and it
	 * cannot be had one way round — the correct rows and the stray ones are the same field.
	 *
	 * <p>Package-private, like {@link #findByActiveOrders} and for the same reason: it is a LEG and not
	 * an answer. "Which reference entries are this patient's active orders" is
	 * {@link #findForActiveOrders}, and nothing else may build a candidate set from this one.

	/**
	 * Which SUBSTANCES of a bridged answer the bridge's own recorded name actually NAMES — the question
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.restsOnAnAmbiguousBridge} asks before a finding prints one of them as
	 * a prescription's (issue #353, review round 2).
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why naming and not counting.</b> The refusal it serves used to be "this order's bridged
	 * answer spans more than one {@code substanceGroupKey}", which cannot tell "the module knows the
	 * prescription is one of these and cannot say which" ({@code Esomeprazole magnesium} →
	 * Esomeprazole AND Omeprazole) from "the prescription genuinely CONTAINS all of these"
	 * ({@code Abacavir / lamivudine} → Abacavir AND Lamivudine). Measured over the shipped knowledge
	 * base, 990 of the 1112 multi-substance bridged concepts have a recorded name that NAMES every substance they
	 * resolve, and the count refused every one of them — what the figure counts, and not a count of combinations: a
	 * derivative name naming its parent moiety satisfies it too (ADR Decision 68 has both shares). Naming separates
	 * the two PER SUBSTANCE: for CIEL 75876 it admits Esomeprazole and refuses Omeprazole out of one answer.
	 *
	 * <p><b>{@link #findNamedSubstances} is the accessor for that question</b> — CLAUDE.md designates
	 * it "ask it before PRINTING a substance's own label in a sentence reporting the patient's record"
	 * — and this is its second production caller, after
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.addAllergyContraindications}. It is asked here rather than at the
	 * validator so that its candidate-set contract is met in the same body that builds the set.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The candidates are ONE ROW PER SUBSTANCE, and that fold is load-bearing.</b>
	 * {@link #findNamedSubstances} takes {@link #findImpliedSubstances}' shape — a representative row
	 * per substance — and its equal-claimant clause refuses a TIE, so handing it a substance's several
	 * route-qualified rows makes them contest each other and the substance is then named by nothing.
	 * Measured: unfolded, 28 bridged concepts of the shipped knowledge base that resolve to exactly ONE
	 * substance are named by nothing at all ({@code Naphazoline} → {@code Naphazoline (nasal)} AND
	 * {@code Naphazoline (ophthalmic)}); folded, none are.
	 *
	 * <p><b>WHICH row represents it is elected and never taken by arrival</b> (review round 3):
	 * {@link DrugReference#canonicalRow}, which CLAUDE.md designates for "which row represents a
	 * substance" and whose first rung is the route qualification the {@code Naphazoline} family above
	 * turns on. Keeping the first row seen made the whole answer a fact about the FILE: measured
	 * through this accessor over the shipped knowledge base, 13 of the 4251 bridged concepts named a
	 * different set of substances when their rows arrived reversed, and whether a substance is named is
	 * whether a finding may state which prescription it came from. Elected, none do; that is
	 * {@code BridgedConceptLegBoundsTest.theSubstancesNamedDoNotDependOnTheOrderTheRowsAreListedIn},
	 * with the 13 as the figure it reddens with. Note what the election does NOT settle: rows a
	 * canonical fold cannot separate keep the incumbent, so a family whose rows are all
	 * route-qualified is still represented by the first of them — and for the {@code Naphazoline}
	 * family, which is exactly that shape, this changes nothing at all.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What that leaves, so the caller's refusal is not read as wider than it is.</b> On the
	 * {@code ddinter} format — the only one carrying a bridge at all — the parser writes the bridge's
	 * name onto every entry it files there AS AN ALIAS (one pass, both readings, see
	 * {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource}), so an answer spanning ONE substance has one uncontested claimant
	 * at {@link DrugReference#NAME_IS_ANOTHER_NAME} or better and is always named. That is why the
	 * caller needs no separate "is this ambiguous at all" conjunct, and it is a property of the LOADER
	 * rather than of the shipped data: an entry assembled without that alias — which no source
	 * produces, but {@code setBridgedConcepts} is public — can survive {@link #findByBridgedConcept}'s
	 * intersection by containment alone and would then be named by nothing.
	 *
	 * @param conceptUuid the concept the answer was resolved for; the bridge's recorded name is read
	 *        off the answer's own entries through {@link DrugReference#bridgedConceptName}, so this
	 *        costs no dataset walk and the per-pass resolution count is unchanged
	 * @param bridged {@link #findByBridgedConcept}'s answer for that concept, handed in rather than
	 *        re-resolved (issue #151)

	 *       side. It is also what leaves apart the sibling pairs that share a stem and no bare row:
	 *       {@code Varicella Zoster Vaccine (Recombinant)} against {@code (live/attenuated)},
	 *       {@code Manganese (chloride)} against {@code (sulfate)}, {@code Typhoid vaccine (live)}
	 *       against {@code (inactivated)}. Audited over the whole shipped KB rather than argued
	 *       (2026-08-09, through this method): 313 published names carry a trailing qualifier and
	 *       exactly 10 gain a substance from this leg — six Moderna COVID-19 presentations reaching
	 *       {@code Moderna covid-19 vaccine}, plus {@code Iron (polysaccharide)} → {@code Iron},
	 *       {@code Multivitamin (prenatal)} → {@code Multivitamin},
	 *       {@code Insulin human (isophane)} → {@code Insulin human} and
	 *       {@code Insulin lispro (protamine)} → {@code Insulin lispro}. Re-run that audit rather than
	 *       trusting the list: it is a property of the dataset, not of this code.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p><b>The bound it carries.</b> A moiety the KB names by a bare WORD rather than by a qualifier is
	 * not reached — {@code Peanut oil} against {@code Peanut}, {@code Dextran 40}, {@code penicillin g,
	 * procaine} — because that shape is indistinguishable by spelling from
	 * {@code Digoxin Immune Fab (Ovine)} against {@code Digoxin}, a patient allergic to digoxin's
	 * ANTIDOTE, which issue #192 measured and separated. Reaching it needs a judgement about substances
	 * rather than about names, which this module does not make; the curated cross-reactivity groups are
	 * where a deployment can state one.
	 *
	 * <p>The other bound is that the legs read the RECORDED STRING and never each other's output, so a
	 * qualifier on a combination name switches the wider legs off instead of composing with them:
	 * {@code abacavir / lamivudine (oral)} is no entry's name, so the claim on it drops to the
	 * containment rank and the equal-claimant leg is skipped, and the constituent it splits into is
	 * {@code lamivudine (oral)}, which is no entry's name either — so that name implies one substance
	 * where the unqualified spelling implies two. Never fewer than the arm had before all of this, so it
	 * is a shape not reached rather than one made worse. No published name in the shipped KB loses a
	 * substance this way (measured through this method; re-derive rather than trusting it), so it
	 * reaches production through a free-text allergen and not through the reference data.

	/**
	 * Of the substances {@link #findImpliedSubstances} reads out of a recorded drug NAME, the ones the
	 * name itself NAMES — the question a caller about to QUOTE the chart asks, and deliberately a
	 * narrower one than which substances the name implies (issue #268).
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why the two differ, and must.</b> That resolution is additive on purpose (issues
	 * #193/#195): a recorded name reaches every substance it could denote, so the class and
	 * cross-reactivity comparisons see all of them. Narrowing it would trade a false positive for a
	 * false NEGATIVE in a safety net. But its equal-claimant leg admits a row on a rank TIE, and a tie
	 * is satisfied by two quite different things — a combination the KB spells without a separator
	 * ({@code amoxicillin and clavulanic acid}, that leg's own reason for existing) and two substances
	 * sharing one name that is neither's display name. The second is a row the recorded name does not
	 * name, and a chip saying "The patient has a recorded allergy to X." about it states something the
	 * chart does not.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Three ways a name names a row</b>, and no leg is exempt AS a leg:
	 * <ul>
	 *   <li>it is the <b>unique strongest NAME claimant</b> — the recorded name IS one of its names
	 *       ({@link DrugReference#NAME_IS_ANOTHER_NAME} or better) and every other implied substance
	 *       claims the whole recorded name strictly less strongly. That keeps an allergy recorded as
	 *       one of a row's own aliases naming its row ({@code papaveretum} → {@code Opium}).
	 *       <p>Deliberately NOT "the first element": {@link #lookupByToken} breaks a tie by earliest
	 *       dataset entry, which carries no clinical meaning, so on a tie the first row has no
	 *       privilege — three shipped rows publish {@code gallium} as their {@code rxnorm_name} and
	 *       exempting the earliest would announce a radiodiagnostic the chart never mentions while
	 *       correcting its two co-tied rivals in the same payload.
	 *       <p>And deliberately NOT "the strongest claim available, however weak", which is what this
	 *       said first and what a reachable input refutes. At the CONTAINMENT rank the equal-claimant
	 *       leg of {@link #findImpliedSubstances} does not run, so rival rows never enter the implied
	 *       set at all and the survivor is uncontested for a reason that is an artefact of the
	 *       resolution rather than evidence about the record: an allergy charted as
	 *       {@code gallium — hives} resolves that way, and naming its row prints the same
	 *       radiodiagnostic off a chart that says {@code Gallium}. Requiring a NAME claim costs nothing
	 *       on a name the reference data publishes — measured 2026-08-24, 145 (name, row) pairs over
	 *       the shipped KB are claimed only at containment, 143 of them named by their own label
	 *       anyway (a name that matched by containment usually CONTAINS the row's name) and the other
	 *       two by the derivation clause below ({@code menthol / selenium disulfide},
	 *       {@code yohimbe preparation / zinc sulfate}). None is lost. Free text is where a containment
	 *       match does not carry the row's name;</li>
	 *   <li>a name its printed label is built from OCCURS in the recorded string
	 *       ({@link DrugReference#labelNameOccursIn}) — what a separator-less combination asserts
	 *       ({@code Amoxicillin} in {@code amoxicillin and clavulanic acid}, {@code Trastuzumab
	 *       emtansine} in {@code ado-trastuzumab emtansine}) and what a shared alias does not;</li>
	 *   <li>a combination CONSTITUENT or the parent MOIETY of the recorded name names its SUBSTANCE, at
	 *       those two legs' OWN ranks and through the same {@link #resolvedAtLeast} they resolve with —
	 *       so every substance {@link #findImpliedSubstances} admits through them is named by
	 *       construction, whichever row ends up representing it. The moiety rank stays
	 *       {@link DrugReference#NAME_IS_THE_DISPLAY_NAME}: that leg's javadoc records why it is
	 *       stricter than the constituent gate, and relaxing it here would license printing the name of
	 *       exactly the rows it refuses.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it gives up, measured like everything else here.</b> Over the shipped KB,
	 * <b>169 of 6888</b> (recorded name, row) pairs take the relationship sentence rather than the
	 * identity one. Most are corrections — a shared alias, or a row the recorded string reaches
	 * through one ({@code acetic acid / hydrocortisone} → {@code Hydrocortisone butyrate},
	 * {@code amoxicillin / clarithromycin / esomeprazole combination kit} → {@code Omeprazole}). The
	 * cost is the rest: a recorded name spelling out several ingredients whose ingredient this KB files
	 * under a SYNONYM is named by none of the three clauses — {@code atovaquone / chloroguanide} does
	 * not carry {@code Proguanil} and no constituent of it resolves there, and
	 * {@code ascorbic acid / folate} does not carry {@code Folic acid}. Both sentences are true; the
	 * more specific one is lost, which is the safe direction for something reporting a record, and the
	 * defect it replaces is a FALSE sentence. The two populations are not separated by a predicate —
	 * telling them apart is a judgement about substances, which is why the sentence changes rather than
	 * the resolution.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it does not reach at all</b>, so that a reader does not take the paragraph above for
	 * the whole surface: this decides WHICH SUBSTANCE a sentence may name, never which ROW represents
	 * that substance. {@link #addSubstance} keeps the first row seen, so a recorded
	 * {@code estradiol / levonorgestrel} still names the estradiol substance by its
	 * {@code Fluoroestradiol f-18} row — a PET tracer the KB files under
	 * {@code [estradiol, db00783]}, the same substance key. That is issue #187/#206's question, it
	 * behaves exactly as it did before issue #268, and nothing here improves or worsens it.
	 *
	 * <p>One more consequence, stated because CLAUDE.md's own rule is that one substance must not be
	 * named two ways in one response: a single recorded allergy CAN now produce two chips whose
	 * sentences name their subject differently, one identifying it and one stating the relationship.
	 * Each names its own drug, so no reader is misled about which drug a chip is about; what is given
	 * up is the uniformity.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Every clause decides rows no other one does.</b> Measured 2026-08-24 through the real
	 * {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource#parse} of the shipped 19 MB KB, this method and
	 * {@link DrugReference#matchesOrderName}, over <b>all 5169 published names</b> as the recorded
	 * string — rows named by that clause and by no other: appended generic 40 (the penicillin G family,
	 * {@code atropine sulfate} → {@code Hyoscyamine (atropine)}), display name 55, unique claim 322,
	 * derived substance 153. State the base: three of those four are the same over any base, and the
	 * unique column is not — restricted to names implying MORE than one substance it reads 1, because
	 * its other 321 are ordinary single-substance names ({@code thyroxine} → {@code Levothyroxine}).
	 * A reader taking the smaller figure for the whole would conclude the clause is all but redundant
	 * and delete it. Re-derive rather than trusting the figures — they are a property of the dataset,
	 * not of this code — but do not drop a clause on the assumption that another covers it.
	 *
	 * <p>Package-private, like {@link #findByActiveOrders} and for the same reason: this answers a
	 * NARROWER question than {@link #findImpliedSubstances} and must never be mistaken for a resolution.
	 * A caller building a candidate set from it would silently drop the substances a recorded name
	 * implies without naming — which is every comparison this module makes about a shared class.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Two production callers since issue #353 review round 2</b>, both printing rather than
	 * resolving: {@code DrugSafetyValidator.addAllergyContraindications}, which asks it of an allergy as
	 * the chart records it, and {@link #substancesNamedByBridge}, which asks it of the name the dataset's
	 * dictionary bridge records for a concept before a finding prints one of that concept's substances
	 * as a prescription's. The second one's candidate set is the bridged answer folded to one row per
	 * substance — this method's own contract, and its javadoc records what handing over the unfolded
	 * rows would cost.
	 *
	 * @param drugName the recorded name, as the chart holds it
	 * @param implied  that name's substances, as {@link #findImpliedSubstances} resolved them — passed

	 * condition records, the candidate set {@code DrugReferenceInjector.matchingEntries} scopes
	 * order-driven injection over (issue #151), and the source of the names {@link #withReferenceNames}
	 * attaches. It unions the documented order-driven matcher ({@link #findByActiveOrders}, which
	 * keys on ATC codes) with a name resolution of every name the patient's active orders carry
	 * ({@link #findImpliedByDrugName} over {@link PatientClinicalContext#getActiveDrugNames()}, the
	 * flattened union of each order's {@code ActiveDrugOrder.getNames()} — since issue #293 a display
	 * name, the free text a clinician typed, and a concept name, not the display alone). One definition, so those consumers cannot come to disagree
	 * about which of the patient's prescriptions the reference data covers.
	 *
	 * <p>That last consumer joined late and at a cost, which is why this list is worth keeping literal:
	 * the injector resolved the ATC-only primitive for itself from the moment this union was
	 * introduced, so the chips and the prompt behind them were computed over different sets of orders.
	 * It now takes the list its caller already resolved rather than calling this a second time.
	 *
	 * <p>Both of those keys are needed because {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasActiveDrug} — the join
	 * that decides whether a rule concerns this patient — matches on name OR ATC, so a subject set
	 * resolved on only one of them cannot be the subject of every chip that join can raise. Neither key
	 * can be assumed present: measured on the 3.7.1 standalone's demo dictionary (2026-08-04), ATC coverage is
	 * sparse but real — 85 of 616 Drug-class concepts carry a map from an ATC-named source
	 * ({@code Torasemide} → {@code C03CA04}, {@code Heparin sodium} → {@code B01AB01}) and 158 carry a
	 * {@code concept_reference_map} of any kind, so {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder} yields ATC
	 * codes for some orders and none for others. Every order on every probe patient there
	 * (Simvastatin, Spironolactone, Tiotropium, Nitroglycerin, Budesonide, Dexamethasone) fell in the
	 * unmapped majority, so an ATC-only subject set was empty for every case measured — which makes
	 * this union a robustness property rather than a workaround for one dictionary: on a
	 * fully-ATC-mapped dictionary the order-driven matcher carries the subject set, and where mapping
	 * is absent the name resolution does. The ATC path is dormant on that instance, not dead.
	 *
	 * <p>The name leg is the recorded-name matcher rather than {@link #findByQuery} since issue #147: an
	 * order's display name is a localized drug name, so resolving it with the prose rule left
	 * {@code Aspirine Co 81mg} and {@code Clarithromycine Co 500mg} matching no entry at all —
	 * measured, 117 (order name, entry) pairs gained and 0 lost over the 3.7.1 dictionary's 2533 names.
	 * That argument used to add "not prose", and issue #293 retired that half: this set now also holds
	 * the free text a clinician typed, which can be a whole sentence. The choice of matcher is
	 * unchanged — the recorded-name rule is still what a localized display name needs, and the prose
	 * rule would still lose the 117 — but what it is applied to is no longer all one shape, and the
	 * cost of that is recorded on {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder.addDrugName}.
	 *
	 * <p>And it is {@link #findImpliedByDrugName} rather than the bare {@link #findByDrugName} since issue
	 * #209: a match is the join for the ATC leg above, where the code either belongs to the order or does
	 * not, but a NAME can be shared by two substances and this list is what three arms report ON. Sarah
	 * Taylor's one {@code Hydrocortisone Injection vial 100mg} order resolved 4 rows and 2 substances, the
	 * second of them {@code Hydrocortisone butyrate}, and the order-driven contraindication arm reported it
	 * as cross-reactive with her dexamethasone allergy — a chip about a drug she is not prescribed. Her
	 * whole order list resolved 18 entries and 9 substances from 8 orders; ranked, 17 and 8.
	 *
	 * <p><b>And a THIRD key since issue #353: the CONCEPT each order was written against</b>
	 * ({@link #findByBridgedConcept}, which carries the case and its bounds). What belongs HERE is the
	 * one rule about the union: that leg needs no analogue in
	 * {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasActiveDrug} and must not be given one. It reaches that join the
	 * way the ATC leg already does, through {@link #withReferenceNames}, which copies the resolved
	 * entries' own aliases into the context's {@code activeDrugReferenceNames}. A rule has no concept
	 * to be keyed on, so a leg there would be a second spelling of a fact this one already carries.
	 *
	 * <p>Identity de-duplication is sound because all three matchers resolve against this bean's shared
	 * {@link #getAll()} cache (the same reason the drugs-in-play set can dedup by identity).
	 *
	 * <p><b>The list is UNMODIFIABLE</b> — adding to it, removing from it or sorting it in place throws
	 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}. Said here rather than only where it is returned, because
	 * this method is public and a caller reads the javadoc: since issue #255 the list one caller holds
	 * can be the same object another reasons over, and the two production paths that could reach a
	 * mutation both sit inside a {@code catch (RuntimeException)}, so an undocumented throw degrades to
	 * no injected records and no chips behind one WARN rather than to a stack trace.
