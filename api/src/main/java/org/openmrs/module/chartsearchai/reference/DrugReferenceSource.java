	/**
	 * @return what the validity check found while {@link #load()} resolved AND parsed its dataset — the

	 *         dataset trips no rule; empty UNCONDITIONALLY only where the implementation runs neither
	 *         check, which of the implementations that exist is the test seam alone. Those two are
	 *         indistinguishable from the outside, which is the whole reason the second is guarded rather
	 *         than stated: this method is DEFAULTED, so a source that does not override it reports an
	 *         empty {@code findings} list for its whole format with nothing erroring and no log line —
	 *         what {@link AtcDrugReferenceSource} did for as long as it resolved its own file (issue
	 *         #266). {@code DrugReferenceSourceValidityChannelTest} is what fails the build on it.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>A new source format's parser reports here.</b> Worth stating plainly, because the
	 *         alternative is issue #242 one format over: a parser that returns no entries for a document
	 *         it cannot read is the whole defect that issue records, and by the time
	 *         {@link DrugReferenceService} sees the result, the document is gone and only a count of zero
	 *         is left — which cannot tell an empty file from one whose content was discarded.
	 *
	 *         <p>Read immediately after {@code load()} on the same instance and retained beside the
	 *         entries, for the same reason as {@link #lastLoadOrigin()}: the load is lazy, so a log line
	 *         cannot be trusted to describe the load that is in force. The content rules are NOT here —
	 *         they need the loaded model rather than a stream, so {@link DrugReferenceService} runs them
	 *         once for every format instead of each source running its own version.
