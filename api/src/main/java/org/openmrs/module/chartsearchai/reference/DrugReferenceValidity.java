/**
 * The drug-reference loader's self-audit: what was wrong with the dataset and the configuration it just
 * loaded, and what it did about each thing. One check with one answer to "what does this loader consider
 * valid", rather than a guard per defect — five separate guards would come to five different answers,
 * and every rule here was filed as its own issue precisely because the loader was silent about one more
 * way its input can violate an assumption its own code makes.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists at all.</b> Issues #149 and #154 established that a load which is WRONG must be
 * loud, and that what was loaded must be observable AFTER the lazy load rather than inferred from a log
 * line that may belong to a previous load. Those covered the COUNT. Every rule below is that same
 * principle applied one layer deeper, to the CONTENT: a dataset can load a plausible number of entries
 * and still violate an assumption that silently changes every safety decision taken from it (#150), drop
 * every rule-bearing row of a substance (#211), be a different dataset than the one configured (#156),
 * publish one substance's name on another, key two substances as one (#196), or carry a null where a
 * value should be and be dereferenced for it. One rule is a layer
 * ABOVE instead, over the document rather than the entries, and for the same reason from the other
 * direction: a file can carry content and load none of it, because it omits a table the parser reading
 * it requires (#242) — an empty PARSE of a non-empty file, where #149 made an empty LOAD loud.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the remedies differ per rule, deliberately.</b> Making them uniform would be a decision taken
 * by default. Each rule below records which of the three it takes and why — one of them, since issue
 * #296, records TWO, so a rule id is not a unique key over one load's findings and a reader picking a
 * finding by rule id alone can be reading a partial count ({@link #ENTRY_NOT_NAMED_BY_ITS_OWN_ALIASES}):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Remedy#DROPPED} where the offending VALUE is the whole defect and the rest of the entry
 *       is usable. Dropping more than that would trade a fail-open for a silent fail-closed, and this
 *       module treats withholding a finding as the worse direction.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Remedy#REPAIRED} where the loader can bring the data to the shape its own resolution
 *       assumes without asserting anything the data does not already say — which, in the one case it
 *       applies to, is what the other two parsers do as they build their alias lists.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Remedy#REPORTED} where fixing it would mean inventing a fact: which rows are one
 *       substance, which of two colliding names is right, or what a table the document never declared
 *       would have held. The data is left exactly as loaded and the operator (or the upstream project)
 *       is told what to fix.</li>
 * </ul>
 * No rule REFUSES a file. The drug-reference feature is an additive net that must never break the answer
 * path ({@link ReferenceDataFiles}), and refusing a dataset over a content defect would turn a
 * misconfiguration into an inert safety layer — the exact state issue #149's WARN exists to flag.
 *
 * <p><b>Every finding is reported, and silence is the absence of a finding rather than a muted one.</b>
 * That distinction is what keeps the channel usable. An untouched default must stay silent:
 * {@code dataFilePath} and {@code crossReactivityGroupsFilePath} both default to paths inside the
 * application data directory that the module never creates, so every install that has configured nothing
 * falls back — or, under {@code sourceFormat=atc}, which bundles no fallback, reads nothing at all — and a
 * rule that warned on either would fire on every such install and be filtered within a week, worse than
 * silence because it trains people to ignore the channel. So
 * {@link #configuredDataFileNotRead} returns without reporting anything there. What it does NOT do is
 * report a finding and then keep it out of a channel: a finding that exists is one somebody needs, and
 * "visible on the status but absent from the log" is the confusion issues #149 and #154 settled — see
 * {@link #CONFIGURED_SOURCE_FORMAT_NOT_USED}, which used to be the exception.
 *
 * <p>Both channels carry every finding, for the same reason: the log says it once, at the moment it
 * happened, and {@link DrugReferenceLoad#getFindings()} — including over
 * {@code GET /chartsearchai/drugreferencestatus} — answers it afterwards, which is the question a lazy
 * load makes a log line unable to answer.
 *
 * <p><b>What is scoped is the LEVEL, and only in the log.</b> "Every finding is loud" was true while every
 * dataset the module shipped was one it authored; since ADR Decision 36 the default is a third-party
 * knowledge base, and a data finding about THAT names something no operator can fix — 19 of its 2283 rows
 * trip two of the rules below, and reporting them at WARN on every install of every deployment is the
 * noise this class exists to avoid. So {@link #logTo(Logger, String)} reports a DATA finding about the
 * dataset the module ships at INFO and everything else at WARN, while the status channel stays identical
 * either way. The level says who can act; the status says what is true. A CONFIGURATION finding is never
 * scoped, because it names a choice the operator made — and because #156's own finding fires exactly when
 * the bundled dataset was the one read.
 *
 * <p>An instance is a per-load collector, created where the load happens and discarded with it — never a
 * field, and never shared between loads. That is issue #172's rule taken for a reason of this class's
 * own rather than for the ones {@link DrugReferenceService}'s class javadoc gives: those are about
 * memos derived from {@code getAll()} on a singleton, and this is a per-LOAD collector, whose findings
 * describe the one load that built it and would be reported against a different dataset if it outlived
 * that load. (Do not follow the issue for a reason either; its own statement of one is false — see that
 * class javadoc.) Not thread-safe, and does not need to be: it is built inside
 * {@code DrugReferenceService.ensureLoaded}'s monitor and is immutable in practice by the time anything
 * else can see it.
 *
 * <p>Some instances live for a PARSE rather than a load — the ones each parser's one-argument
 * {@code parse} form builds for itself. Same rule at a shorter scope, and safe for the same reason every
 * time: each is a local of the call that made it, and each is handed no load to describe, so what it
 * collects reaches {@link #logTo} and stops there rather than reaching a status that would then be
 * describing a parse. That is a property of the one-argument FORM and not of any dataset: since issue
 * #266 every parser here has both forms, including the cross-reactivity groups loader, whose load-side
 * findings do now reach a status ({@link CrossReactivityGroupsLoad}).

	 *
	 * <p><b>Why the existing loud thing does not cover it.</b> {@link DrugReferenceLoad#isInert()} sees
	 * the OUTCOME — a source was selected and produced zero entries — and issue #149's WARN fires on it.
	 * What neither can do is say why, because by then the document is gone: that WARN offers a
	 * format/path mismatch as the usual cause, which is a guess, and the findings channel an operator can
	 * poll after a lazy load (#154) said nothing at all. Only the parser knows the file declared drug
	 * rows and no interaction table, and that is the difference between "your file is empty" and "your
	 * file's content was discarded".
	 *
	 * <p><b>REPORTED, and not either of the other two remedies.</b> Repairing it means reading a table
	 * the document never declared as an empty one, which is the single thing the loader cannot know here:
	 * a catalogue that carries no interactions and an export truncated before it wrote them are the same
	 * document to this parser, and loading the second as the first would put a plausible entry count on a
	 * file missing most of itself — {@link #CONFIGURED_DATA_FILE_NOT_READ}'s shape, arrived at from the
	 * other side. So the count stays 0, which says plainly that nothing loaded, and the finding says what
	 * to add. Refusing the file is not available either, for the reason no rule here refuses one.
	 *
	 * <p>Stated over "a table THIS parser requires" rather than over one schema, because the same silence
	 * exists in both directions, and which one is likelier moved with the default: while it was {@code json},
	 * an untouched {@code sourceFormat} beside a {@code dataFilePath} naming a DDInter export handed a
	 * DDInter document to the curated parser, and that is the direction this rule was written for. Since
	 * ADR Decision 36 the untouched case is {@code ddinter}, so the likely mismatch is now the mirror of
	 * it — an operator's curated file read by the DDInter parser — which is why the rule is stated over
	 * "a table THIS parser requires" and covers both without naming either schema.
	 * Issue #156's rule is correctly silent there — {@code json} and {@code ddinter} both name real
	 * adapters, so nothing was overridden — and the mismatch is between the format and the FILE, which
	 * only the parser can observe.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The {@code atc} format is covered by a rule of its own, not by this one.</b> Issue #264 named
	 * it as a residual here and issue #266 closed it: an ATC dataset is line-based, so there is no table
	 * to declare or omit, and a file of another format read by it yields nothing for a different
	 * reason — no line matched an ATC code. That is {@link #NO_LINE_YIELDED_AN_ENTRY}. Closing it also
	 * took the channel: {@link AtcDrugReferenceSource} now resolves its file through
	 * {@link ReferenceDataFiles#loadOperatorFile} and overrides
	 * {@link DrugReferenceSource#lastLoadFindings()}, so a collector does reach it. Do not widen this
	 * rule to cover that case by naming a table an ATC document never declares.

	 * Issues #150 and #210/#211's precondition, in one pass because both are per-entry statements about
	 * one alias list and the second is only true of what the first leaves behind.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Blank aliases are DROPPED</b> (#150). An alias with no letter or digit in it names nothing, so
	 * it cannot identify a drug and can only match by accident — and it does:
	 * the scan already refuses a token that is EMPTY after the diacritic fold, whichever of the boundary
	 * rule's arities it arrives through, but a single space is not empty. Where a space sits after a
	 * non-alphanumeric
	 * character its left boundary holds, and the recorded-name rule's two-letter inflection allowance then
	 * carries the match over a short trailing word. So a blank alias makes
	 * {@link DrugReference#matchesDrugName} true for allergen text the entry has nothing to do with, and
	 * that entry's contraindications fire for a patient with an unrelated allergy — failing OPEN.
	 *
	 * <p>Narrower than "every allergen", and worth stating because the bound is what makes this latent
	 * rather than obvious. Measured through {@link DrugReference#matchesDrugName} on an entry carrying
	 * {@code [warfarin, " "]}: {@code Vitamin A, B} matches and {@code Aspirin},
	 * {@code Sodium chloride} and {@code Amphotericin B, liposomal} do not — a single-word allergen has no
	 * space at all, and a space preceded by a letter fails the left boundary. It takes a recorded name
	 * with a non-alphanumeric before a space and a short word after it. The prose matcher is false on the
	 * same string, which is the asymmetry issue #150 reports: #148 gave allergen resolution the
	 * recorded-name rule, and the tail allowance is what opened this.
	 *
	 * <p>The offending token and not the entry, deliberately. The entry's other aliases, its ATC codes and
	 * its rules are all valid and may be its only coverage — the ATC codes especially, since
	 * {@link DrugReferenceService#findByActiveOrders} matches on those and not on aliases at all — so
	 * refusing the entry would convert a fail-open into a silent fail-closed. Dropping the token removes
	 * exactly the thing that fails open and nothing else, which is why it is preferred over refusing the
	 * entry rather than merely gentler than it.
	 *
	 * <p><b>An entry no alias of its own names is REPAIRED</b> (#210, #211) — <b>except where its display
	 * NAME is itself a string that names nothing, which is REPORTED instead</b> (#296). Repairing that
	 * one would append as an alias exactly what the blank-alias rule above drops, and leave the entry
	 * answering {@link DrugReference#isNamed} for a string {@link DrugReference#matchesDrugName} can
	 * never match — the disagreement {@link DrugReference#setAliases}' trim exists to make impossible.
	 * So one rule id can carry two remedies in one load, and each says which entries it applied to. The ranked resolution rests on
	 * a property of the PARSERS: {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource} makes an entry's display name its first
	 * alias and {@link AtcDrugReferenceSource} makes it the only one, so on both of those the strongest
	 * claimant on any alias an entry carries is itself in the matched set. A hand-authored {@code json}
	 * file need not do that, and {@code json} is the DEFAULT format — there the rank-2 claimant can be an
	 * entry the matcher never reached, and then no matched row's alias denotes its own substance and every
	 * one is dropped ({@code DrugReferenceService.rowsOf} bounds that to "never emptied", which is a floor
	 * rather than a fix). Giving the entry its own display name asserts nothing the file does not already
	 * say — it IS the entry's name — and it is exactly what the other two parsers do, so the invariant
	 * holds by construction on every format instead of resting on the shape of the file.
	 *
	 * <p>Lowercased as those parsers lowercase theirs, so an alias list stays one vocabulary; the authored
	 * aliases are kept and the name is appended, so nothing an author wrote is replaced. Kept as
	 * {@link DrugReference#setAliases} stores them, which since issue #296 is TRIMMED — surrounding
	 * whitespace is the one thing an author writes that does not survive, because untrimmed it makes
	 * {@link DrugReference#isNamed} and {@link DrugReference#matchesDrugName} disagree about the same
	 * pair. That setter carries the measurement; this pass sees the trimmed list and its own rules are
	 * unaffected by it: both of them read an alias through {@code namesAnything}, which folds before it
	 * looks for a letter or digit, or through {@link DrugReference#normalizeName}, which trims — so a
	 * padded alias answered THOSE predicates exactly as its trimmed form does. That is the narrow sense
	 * in which nothing here moves, and not the false general one: the trim exists precisely because

	/**
	 * Issue #211, and the decision it asked for rather than a patch.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The defect.</b> Rows of one substance can disagree about which of them carries the interaction
	 * and contraindication rules. The ranked resolution decides which rows a name puts in play by NAME
	 * claim, which is silent about rules, and it takes that verdict per SUBSTANCE — so where the rows of
	 * what a clinician would call one drug key as DIFFERENT substances, only the strongest claimant on the
	 * shared name survives and every other row's rules go with it. Measured on a hand-authored fixture: an
	 * order for {@code Ibuprofen 400mg} keeps the bare {@code Ibuprofen} row, which carries no rules, and
	 * drops the two presentations that do. The candidate set is non-empty, so #210's emptying guard is
	 * satisfied and the findings are gone anyway.
	 *
	 * <p>An order naming a PRESENTATION ({@code Ibuprofen tablets 400mg}) keeps that presentation, because
	 * the repair above gives every row its own name and the string carries it. So the shape that still
	 * loses rules is the ordinary one — a name carrying only the substance's name — which is why the
	 * repair narrows this defect without closing it.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why this is a load-time rule and not a resolution change.</b> The issue records three options.
	 * Preferring a rule-bearing row among equally-strong claimants re-introduces a rule-shaped tie-break
	 * into a name-shaped ranking, which is the confusion issue #209 was filed to remove, and it would
	 * change which row every chip names on data that is perfectly well-formed. Pooling a substance's rules
	 * changes what a chip's {@code ref} refers to, so a citable record would carry a rule that is not in
	 * the row it cites. The third — validate at load — is the only one that does not change a correct
	 * answer on correct data, and it is right for a further reason: the loader cannot tell a presentation
	 * of one substance from a second substance whose name merely nests inside the first, and inferring it
	 * from spelling is exactly the substance judgement issues #164 and #192 measured this module must not
	 * make. {@link DrugReference#substanceKey()} needs the DATA to say so.
	 *
	 * <p><b>So: REPORTED.</b> The rows stay as loaded and the operator is told which published name is
	 * ambiguous. The fix is in the file, and it is what the shipped datasets already do: declare
	 * {@code substanceName} on the rows that are one substance, and name a presentation with a TRAILING
	 * PARENTHESIZED qualifier. Both halves are needed, which is worth stating because the first alone
	 * looks sufficient and is not: a curated file publishes no substance registry, so
	 * {@link DrugReference#substanceKey()} has nothing to confirm the claim with and falls back to the
	 * display STEM — under which {@code Ibuprofen tablets} is still its own substance while
	 * {@code Ibuprofen (tablets)} is not. {@code DrugReferenceValidityContextTest} pins both files.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The residual, named rather than left to be rediscovered.</b> An author who declares
	 * {@code substanceName} and does NOT follow that naming convention gets silence here and still loses
	 * rules, because this rule is gated on declaring no substance name at all. Widening it to "the rows
	 * key differently although the data claimed one substance" is not available: on the shipped knowledge
	 * base that state is also how the DrugBank registry REFUSES a claim — the 19 substance-name families
	 * naming two or more DrugBank substances have their id withheld and fall back to the stem
	 * deliberately (issue #164), and {@link DrugReference#getSubstanceId()} is null in both cases, so the
	 * loaded model cannot tell "no registry" from "the registry says these differ". Flagging it would
	 * report {@code Omeprazole} against {@code Esomeprazole} — a separation this module is careful to
	 * keep — on the default configuration. Closing it needs the curated schema to be able to state a
	 * substance identity, which is a schema decision and not this check's.
	 *
	 * <p>The shipped datasets are quiet: every DDInter row publishes an {@code rxnorm_name}, so this
	 * cannot fire on the knowledge base, and an ATC entry carries no rules to lose.
	 *
	 * <p>Gated on the entry CARRYING rules, which is what makes the rule about a loss rather than about a
	 * name. A row with no interactions, contraindications or dose bands loses nothing by being dropped
	 * from a candidate set — it contributes no finding either way — and every {@code atc} entry is such a
	 * row, so the gate is also what keeps a classification-only dataset silent.

	/**
	 * The check decided on issue #196: an entry publishing, among its OWN names, a name that a different
	 * substance is CALLED.
	 *
	 * <p>Aliases are this module's resolution keys, so a name filed on the wrong entry is not a cosmetic
	 * data error. Two of the eight defects that issue records are this shape:
	 * {@code Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine} carries {@code moderna covid-19 vaccine}, a rival
	 * manufacturer's product, and {@code Trastuzumab emtansine} carries {@code trastuzumab deruxtecan}
	 * because all three trastuzumab rows share one CIEL cross-walk list although they are three DrugBank
	 * substances with three ATC codes. The second produced a false clinical statement live — a Kadcyla
	 * allergy reported as "a recorded allergy to Trastuzumab deruxtecan". Issue #210 blocks the prose
	 * direction by ranking the claim, but {@link DrugReference#isNamed} — rule-token identity — does not
	 * rank, so the collision stays reachable however the prose legs are ordered.
	 *
	 * <p><b>That quoted sentence is no longer what the arm says</b> (issue #268). In every sentence
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.addAllergyContraindications} emits — the identity chip and both class
	 * chips — the position that ASSERTS the allergy names a substance by its own label only where the
	 * recorded name NAMES it ({@link DrugReferenceService#findNamedSubstances}), and otherwise quotes
	 * the charted allergen token. A label can still appear elsewhere in the sentence: the identity
	 * chip's second form opens with the drug it is about, which is the subject rather than the claim.
	 * What is unchanged is everything this check exists for — the borrowed name is still a resolution
	 * key, so the wrong substance still enters the class and cross-reactivity comparisons and is still
	 * reported as related to the patient's allergy; only the NAME it is reported under moves, and the
	 * fix is still in the dataset. Do not read the chip's correction as making this rule redundant.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Two conditions, each excluding a shape that is CORRECT</b>, which is what keeps this from
	 * being a channel operators filter:
	 * <ul>
	 *   <li>the two entries must be different substances to {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()} —
	 *       otherwise one substance filed under two names is flagged, which issue #164 decided is one
	 *       substance ({@code Daxibotulinumtoxina} against {@code Botulinum toxin type A});</li>
	 *   <li>neither display stem may carry the other as a word — otherwise every ester, salt and
	 *       presentation whose own name extends the substance's is flagged, and those are legitimate:
	 *       {@code Hydrocortisone butyrate} publishing {@code hydrocortisone} is a true statement about a
	 *       true relationship, and narrowing it is what issues #198/#209 do at resolution time rather
	 *       than something a loader should refuse.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * Through {@link DrugReference#containsWord} on the display stems rather than a fresh comparison, so
	 * "one name carries another" means here what it means to the matchers.
	 *
	 * <p><b>REPORTED.</b> The module has no better data to substitute: it can only choose WHICH of two
	 * drugs to name, and the data says they are interchangeable, so no choice it makes is right. Dropping
	 * the alias would lose the resolutions that name is the only path to, and dropping the row would lose
	 * its real interaction rules — both fail closed, silently, to fix a fail-loud. Issue #196 records the
	 * data fix as an upstream handoff, and this is the check that finds the rows to hand off.

	/**
	 * The check for issue #196 item 4: a row the dataset merged into a substance its OWN name says it
	 * is only a DERIVATIVE of.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why the rule above cannot see this, structurally.</b>
	 * {@link #reportAliasesNamingAnotherSubstance} reports a published name denoting a DIFFERENT
	 * substance, and its first exclusion is that the two entries key alike — so where the merge itself
	 * is the defect there is no different substance left for it to find. The shipped case:
	 * {@code Fluoroestradiol f-18} publishes {@code rxnorm_name: estradiol} and carries no
	 * {@code drugbank_id}, so {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}'s per-family resolution hands it
	 * {@code Estradiol}'s {@code DB00783} and a PET imaging tracer and a therapeutic oestrogen become one
	 * substance to {@link DrugReference#substanceKey()}. Measured over the shipped 19 MB KB 2026-08-13 by
	 * driving {@link DrugReferenceService#getLoadStatus()} over it: that rule fires 18 times and this row
	 * is in none of them.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The criterion, and why it is not "one substance, unlike names".</b> That broader predicate was
	 * measured first — {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()} over the shipped KB, then
	 * {@link DrugReference#displayStem}/{@link DrugReference#containsWord} between each family's rows —
	 * and it fires on 15 rows across 8 families — a set that includes BOTH merges issue #164 measured as
	 * CORRECT, {@code Daxibotulinumtoxina} with {@code Botulinum toxin type A} and
	 * {@code Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine} with {@code Tozinameran}. A rule reporting those would
	 * tell an operator that this module's own correct behaviour is a data defect. So the criterion is the relationship the row's own NAME states rather than the absence of
	 * one: a name that carries the substance's name WITHOUT a word boundary is a derivative — fluoro-,
	 * levo-, dex-, es-, nor- — and this module already reads it that way everywhere else.
	 * {@link DrugReference#containsWord} is exactly what separates {@code Levoketoconazole} from
	 * {@code Ketoconazole} and {@code Esomeprazole} from {@code Omeprazole} in every matcher here. So the
	 * dataset's registry is contradicting the module's own name rule, and it is the registry's silence
	 * that let it: those two pairs are kept apart only because each derivative carries its OWN DrugBank
	 * id, which withholds the family's id and drops the verdict to the display stem (issue #164). This
	 * rule is the residue of that mechanism — the merges that survived because the derivative row named
	 * no substance at all.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Both conditions exclude a shape that is CORRECT</b>, which is what keeps this off the list of
	 * channels operators filter:
	 * <ul>
	 *   <li>the family must hold a row the derivative could have been merged WITH — one that is not
	 *       itself a derivative of the same claim ({@link #holdsAParent}). That excludes both a lone row
	 *       claiming a substance name, which confuses nothing and whose wrong {@code rxnorm_name} is the
	 *       shape issue #196 records as undetectable from inside the file, and a derivative the module
	 *       has correctly kept APART from its parent that has route variants of its OWN;</li>
	 *   <li>the name must carry the substance's own name as a bounded WORD to be excluded, so every
	 *       presentation, salt and ester is read as what it is rather than as a derivative. That is not
	 *       a rare shape: 12 rows of the shipped KB carry their substance's name as a bounded word
	 *       ({@code Beclomethasone dipropionate} under {@code beclomethasone},
	 *       {@code Estrone sulfate} under {@code estrone}, the four
	 *       {@code Human immunoglobulin G} routes under {@code immunoglobulin g}), measured through
	 *       {@link DrugReference#displayStem}/{@link DrugReference#containsWord} over the file.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * Folded through {@link DrugReference#foldDiacritics} before the substring half so that half and
	 * {@link DrugReference#containsWord} read the same alphabet; unfolded, a localized dataset would be
	 * quieter about a real merge than an ASCII one. No shipped row can witness that — measured
	 * 2026-08-13, none of the 2283 carries a non-ASCII character in {@code name} or {@code rxnorm_name}
	 * — so {@code ddi-derivative-rule-edges.json} is hand-authored and says so.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Which datasets this can fire on at all, and why it is one.</b> Reporting needs a family
	 * holding both a derivative row and a row that is not one, so it needs
	 * {@link DrugReference#substanceKey()} to be shared by rows whose display STEMS differ. Only a
	 * resolved substance registry id can do that: where the key falls back to the stem — the curated
	 * {@code json} schema, which publishes no registry — every row of a family has the same stem AND
	 * the same substance name, so {@link #derivesFromItsOwnSubstance} is constant across it and the
	 * family is either wholly derivative (no parent, skipped) or wholly not (nothing to report). The
	 * {@code atc} adapter publishes no substance name at all, so every row is its own family. Today
	 * that leaves the {@code ddinter} adapter, and this is a derivation from the two gates rather than
	 * a list of formats to maintain.
	 *
	 * <p><b>REPORTED.</b> Splitting the rows would be inventing the fact the data is missing — the
	 * loader cannot tell a derivative that is a different substance from one the registry would confirm
	 * is the same, which is the judgement issues #164 and #192 measured this module must not make — and
	 * dropping the row would lose real interaction rules (the tracer carries four of its own). Both fail
	 * closed, silently, to fix a fail-loud. The fix is a substance registry id on the derivative row, and
	 * this is the check that finds the rows to hand upstream.
	 *
	 * <p>Measured over the shipped 19 MB KB 2026-08-13, by this method through
	 * {@link DrugReferenceService#getLoadStatus()}: <b>one</b> row, {@code Fluoroestradiol f-18}.
	 * Re-measure before relying on the figure.
