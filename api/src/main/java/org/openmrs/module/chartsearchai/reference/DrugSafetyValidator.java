/**
 * Part 2 of the drug-reference feature: a deterministic post-LLM check that runs
 * after the answer is generated and <em>annotates</em> it with {@link SafetyWarning}s.
 * It never rewrites or blocks the answer — the clinician decides.
 *
 * <p>For every reference drug in play — those the question asks about, plus those the answer
 * names on its own authority (a drug the answer mentions only by echoing the text of a record the
 * mention is attributable to is a mention, not a proposal, and is excluded — see
 * {@code isEchoOfAttributableRecord}, issues #105 and #360) — it checks three things against the
 * patient's clinical context and the reference table.
 * One check departs from that framing deliberately: the question-named PAIR arm reads the reference
 * table alone, and covers the drugs the QUESTION resolved to rather than all of those in play, so it
 * answers "does A interact with B?" for a patient on neither — see {@link #addQuestionPairInteractions}.
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Overdose</b> — a daily dose parsed from the answer exceeds the
 *       reference {@code maxDailyDoseMg} for the patient's age band; or, when the patient's
 *       weight is known, a per-administration dose exceeds the band's {@code mgPerKgMax} ×
 *       weight (the only possible check for bands publishing mg/kg dosing with no daily
 *       maximum, and the tighter one for small patients). One warning per drug — the
 *       published daily ceiling wins when both arms trip.</li>
 *   <li><b>Interactions</b> — the drug interacts with one of the patient's active orders:
 *       by a hand-authored rule (a rule whose source rates it below
 *       {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.minInteractionSeverity} is not raised — unrated rules
 *       are never floor-filtered), by sharing an ATC chemical subgroup with an active order
 *       (duplicate-therapy reasoning), or — failing that — by sharing a curated
 *       {@link CrossReactivityGroup} (cross-branch family overlap). One warning per (SUBSTANCE, active
 *       order), whichever of those reasons applies and however many apply at once: several rules can
 *       name one partner — DDInter's route variants of a drug all publish the same match token — and
 *       they collapse to the most severe row ({@link #bestRulePerPartner}); the several rows one
 *       substance is FILED as collapse the same way on the subject side, so a question naming a
 *       substance no longer chips once per route ({@link #addInteractionWarnings}, issue #162); and a
 *       partner that is
 *       BOTH an explicit rule partner and class-related yields one chip carrying both relationships
 *       rather than one chip per arm ({@link #addInteractionWarnings}, issue #88). Separately, and
 *       needing no patient data at all, one question-named drug interacts with ANOTHER DRUG THE
 *       SAME QUESTION NAMED — see
 *       {@link #addQuestionPairInteractions}, the arm that answers "does A interact with B?" for a
 *       patient on neither.</li>
 *   <li><b>Contraindications</b> — the drug is contraindicated by an active allergy or
 *       condition: by a hand-authored rule, by being the same drug as — or sharing an ATC
 *       chemical subgroup with — a recorded allergy (cross-reactivity reasoning), or —
 *       failing both — by sharing a curated {@link CrossReactivityGroup} with the allergy
 *       (cross-branch cross-reactivity). One warning per (SUBSTANCE, recorded finding), not per
 *       reference row: a dataset that files one substance as several route or formulation rows put
 *       every one of them in play from one clinician-facing word, and each raised its own chip — the
 *       siblings of the row the allergy resolved to reporting the substance as cross-reactive with
 *       itself ({@link ContraindicationChips}, issue #145). Per recorded FINDING and not per arm
 *       either: a hand-authored allergy rule naming the very drug it is filed against reports the
 *       identity check's fact, so the two fold into one chip keeping whichever wording carries the
 *       deployment's own note (issue #146 — 3 of the 4 entries in the shipped curated file). These
 *       same two checks additionally run over the patient's OWN ACTIVE ORDERS — "is the patient
 *       allergic to something they are taking?" is a fact about their chart, and the drug-in-play
 *       framing above could not ask it (see {@link #addActiveOrderContraindications}, issue #143) —
 *       scoped to what the RESPONSE is about, either side of the chip counting, since that arm
 *       annotates an answer rather than raising an alert ({@link SubjectMatter}).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The rule-based checks fire on the entry's own curated {@code interactions}/
 * {@code contraindications}; the <em>class-based</em> checks need only ATC codes, so they
 * are the mechanism by which an authoritative classification source ({@link AtcDrugReferenceSource},
 * which carries no rules) still produces safety reasoning. "Same class" means a shared ATC
 * level-4 chemical subgroup ({@link DrugReference#ATC_SUBGROUP_PREFIX_LENGTH}), e.g. ibuprofen {@code M01AE01}
 * and naproxen {@code M01AE02} both {@code M01AE}. ATC's tree does not capture cross-branch
 * pharmacological cross-reactivity (aspirin {@code N02BA01} vs ibuprofen {@code M01AE01}); that
 * linkage is carried as curated data — {@link CrossReactivityGroup}s loaded alongside any
 * source — and both class checks fall back to it when no ATC subgroup is shared, so the family
 * reasoning stays data-driven end to end. A shared subgroup is necessary but not sufficient since
 * issue #167: one that classifies neither the substances nor a therapy is skipped, and the pair falls
 * through to the curated groups as though nothing were shared — see
 * {@link DrugReference#isUnclassifyingAtcCode}. Since issues #183/#184 how much a subgroup must
 * assert depends on WHICH claim is being made: naming a purpose ("Antibiotics") is enough to call two
 * drugs duplicate therapy and not enough to call them cross-reacting, so the contraindication arm
 * additionally skips everything {@link DrugReference#isPurposeOnlyAtcCode} recognises. The two arms
 * therefore no longer see the same "same class"; {@link #sharedClass} is where that single difference
 * lives. See ADR Decision 24.
 *
 * <p>One contraindication check is neither rule-based nor class-based: a recorded allergy to the very
 * drug in play is IDENTITY, and needs no rule, no ATC code and no curated group. It is therefore not
 * gated on classification data — issue #135, where it was, and 444 of the full DDInter dataset's 2283
 * entries (19.4%, none of them carrying any ATC code) consequently raised no chip for the most basic
 * check here. See {@link #addAllergyContraindications}.
 *
 * <p>Two checks do not need a drug in play at all. The first is the patient's own active orders
 * checked against their own allergy and condition records — see
 * {@link #addActiveOrderContraindications}, issue #143, which exists because the echo scoping below
 * withheld exactly that finding for a drug appearing in a cited {@code drug_order} record. It needs
 * no drug in play; it is not therefore unconditional, and {@link SubjectMatter} bounds it to the
 * responses it has something to say about.
 *
 * <p>The second: a question that asks to be <em>screened</em> for
 * interactions ("are there any drug interactions with her current medications?") names no drug, so
 * the patient's active orders are screened against <em>each other</em> — see
 * {@link #addActiveOrderPairInteractions}, issue #113. It reuses the same rule join and the same
 * severity floor as the drug-in-play arm above; the trigger is
 * {@link QueryScopeRouter#isInteractionScreening}, and it stands down as soon as the question names
 * a drug the LOADED DATASET RECOGNISES, because then the arm above has its anchor. (Naming a drug the
 * dataset does not carry leaves the screen running: the gate is dataset recognition, not lexical, and
 * there is deliberately no second drug vocabulary here to tell the two apart — see decision 1 on
 * {@link QueryScopeRouter#isInteractionScreening}.)
 *
 * <p>Conservative by design: overdose is flagged only when a value can be computed AND it
 * exceeds a published maximum — a daily total over {@code maxDailyDoseMg}, or (only with a
 * fresh recorded weight) a per-administration dose over {@code mgPerKgMax} × weight; class-based
 * interactions skip an active order that is the <em>same substance</em> (restating existing therapy
 * is not a duplicate). A question or answer that names no reference drug produces no warnings
 * (the no-false-positive case) unless the patient's own chart supplies the subject — the two
 * deliberate exceptions above, both still no-false-positive checks. The interaction screen reports
 * only pairs the reference data actually relates ("rates" would be too narrow — an unrated rule is
 * exempt from the severity floor, not filtered by it, so unrated pairs are screened too). The
 * active-order contraindication arm reports only a drug the patient is ON whose own allergy or
 * condition records contraindicate it, and stands down entirely when neither is recorded.
 *
 * <p><b>Every memo of anything derived from {@code DrugReferenceService.getAll()} is a per-call LOCAL
 * of the pass that made it, never a field of this bean</b> — issue #172's rule, stated with its reasons
 * in {@code DrugReferenceService}'s class javadoc. Said here because this class holds most of the sites
 * it binds, and a reader adding one is in this file rather than that one.

	 * <p><b>Contraindications only, and not by a filter.</b> Nothing here selects a type. Every other

The delegate this issue added below wraps its first two lines exactly as this one does, so a needle stopping at line two would now match twice and hard-fail. What has not changed is the instruction: move this declaration and the needles
	 * move with it — {@code ChipSubjectOneResolutionTest} and {@code CoMedicationResolutionPerPassTest},
	 * which say so themselves.
	 *
	 * @param resolvedOrderEntries the patient's active orders ALREADY resolved to their reference
	 *        entries by a caller that needed them itself, or {@code null} from a caller that has not
	 *        resolved them — which is every caller but {@code DrugReferenceInjector.injectRecords}.
	 *        Issue #255: that method resolves the list for its own promotion predicate, for
	 *        {@code matchingEntries}' candidate set (issue #151) and for the reference names it
	 *        attaches, and then calls in here; resolving it again was a second derivation of a value
	 *        the pass already held. {@code CLAUDE.md}'s {@code findForActiveOrders} bullet prescribes
	 *        the shape — "wherever a caller already holds the resolved list, pass it down rather than
	 *        resolving again" — and it is a PARAMETER rather than a memo for issue #172's reason: this
	 *        bean is a Spring singleton, so a field would be one unsynchronized map shared by every
	 *        concurrent request.
	 *
	 *        <p>It is the transported input and not a transported CONTEXT: {@link
	 *        DrugReferenceService#withReferenceNames} is still applied below, because it costs no
	 *        dataset walk and keeping it here leaves this method the sole constructor of the context
	 *        it reasons over. A caller that handed a pre-enriched context instead would make that
	 *        construction depend on the caller having applied the right step, and a caller that got it
	 *        wrong would be silent.
	 *
	 *        <p>It is READ here and never written — every use below is an iteration or a pass-through,
	 *        and that is now load-bearing where it was not. The caller does not hand the list over: it
	 *        goes on rendering from the very same one after this returns ({@code render(ref,
	 *        orderEntries, …)}), so an arm added here that mutated it would change what the injector
	 *        puts in the chart, after the fact. The contract is therefore enforced at the producer
	 *        rather than described here —
	 *        {@link DrugReferenceService#findForActiveOrders} returns an unmodifiable list — and no
	 *        copy is taken here. Do not read that as a class-wide convention: the
	 *        {@code List<SafetyWarning> warnings} the arms below take is an ACCUMULATOR and is written
	 *        by design.
	 *
	 *        <p>Passing a list resolved from a DIFFERENT context than {@code rawContext} is the one
	 *        way to misuse this. The injector's own list is resolved from the raw context this then
	 *        receives enriched, and those answer alike — {@code withReferenceNames} writes only
	 *        {@code activeDrugReferenceNames}, which {@code findForActiveOrders} does not read.
	 *        {@code ActiveOrderResolutionPerPassTest} pins both halves: that the pass resolves once,
	 *        and that what it injects is what a self-resolving pass produces.
	 *
	 * @param pairExtentSink where the arm that made a statement says how many above-floor rule pairs it found
	 *        and how many of them it reported — {@link #maxPairChips()}'s cut for either PAIRWISE arm,
	 *        and everything it found for the uncapped drug-in-play arm, which states it where neither
	 *        of those stated one AND the question resolved a drug it could screen (issue #356; issue
	 *        #370, ADR Decision 71) — or {@code null} down every
	 *        path but the one {@code LlmInferenceService} takes to publish it on the answer. It is
	 *        a caller-supplied per-call object rather than a field for issue #172's reason, the same
	 *        one {@code resolvedOrderEntries} above gives. Issue #336: without it a capped list was
	 *        indistinguishable from a complete one everywhere but the log. See
	 *        {@link PairChipExtent} for what an absent statement does and does not mean.
	 *
	 * @param scope what this pass is FOR — see {@link SubjectMatterScope}. Every caller but
	 *        {@link #standingChartAlerts(PatientClinicalContext)} reaches this through the
	 *        six-argument delegate above, which supplies
	 *        {@link SubjectMatterScope#OF_THE_RESPONSE}, so no existing path can reach the unbounded
	 *        gate by omission and a new one has to name it.

	 *
	 * <p><b>Do not restate that as a pair count by halving it.</b> This javadoc said "i.e. 54 unordered

	 * so an uncapped arm both buries the clinician under chips and writes the whole cross-product into
	 * the context window. Measured on the 16-drug DDInter excerpt with the patient on nothing: one question
	 * naming all 16 raised 72 chips carrying 42,708 characters of finding text, against a path
	 * that caps a SINGLE reference record at {@link DrugReferenceInjector#MAX_INTERACTION_RENDER_CHARS}
	 * = 1500 for precisely this reason. On the screening side, DDInter's longest mechanism text (~1.2k
	 * chars) puts the default cap's contribution at ~12k characters, comparable to a handful of the
	 * reference records the prompt already carries. Removing the cap is not an option; this is a
	 * backstop, not a routine truncation — a realistic regimen produces a handful of above-floor pairs,
	 * not tens.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why it is a global property (issue #131).</b> The default is the number both arms were
	 * hardcoded to, and ten covers every pair among five named drugs — well past the "does A interact
	 * with B?" question the pair arm exists for, and roughly 6k characters of finding text in that worst
	 * case. But which pairs a clinician should see is a clinical judgement, not a build-time one.
	 * Measured live on the 3.7.1 standalone against the FULL DDInter knowledge base (2026-08-05), a
	 * 16-drug polypharmacy question logged {@code 10 of 72 … (cap 10)} and withheld
	 * {@code [Major ×13, Moderate ×40, Minor ×9]}: a clinician reviewing sixteen medications is shown
	 * ten Majors while THIRTEEN MORE are withheld. (Issue #131 reports {@code 10 of 65} withholding
	 * {@code [Major ×10, Moderate ×37, Minor ×8]} for a differently-worded 16-drug question; that
	 * question is not in the tree and its profile was not reproduced here, so the figures above are the
	 * ones this cap was sized against.) A polypharmacy review clinic may want 30 where a triage screen
	 * wants 5, and that belongs in a deployment's hands.
	 *
	 * <p><b>One property for both arms</b>, deliberately: their gates are mutually exclusive — the pair
	 * arm needs the question to resolve two or more reference drugs, the screen needs it to resolve none
	 * — so at most one of them runs per question and no question can be subject to both. Two separately
	 * tunable limits for one concept would be arbitrary. It bounds those two and nothing else: the
	 * drug-in-play arm raises one chip per partner it relates and has never been capped, which is why
	 * the extent it states (issue #356) always reports everything it found. Fail-safe like
	 * {@code weightMaxAgeDays} and {@code minInteractionSeverity}: an unparseable or non-positive
	 * value falls back to the default rather than disabling the cap, because a typo'd GP must not turn
	 * a bounded safety net into an unbounded question-controlled prompt expansion.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What the cap drops, and how it is visible.</b> A count rather than a character budget: a
	 * chip is a whole sentence a clinician reads, and half a chip is not a smaller chip. Candidates are
	 * ordered most-severe-first BEFORE the cut, so what goes is the least severe, and every withheld
	 * pair is NAMED in a WARN — a silent truncation would read to a clinician as "everything is
	 * covered". <b>The WARN is no longer the only place the cut surfaces</b> (issue #336): both arms
	 * now state how many pairs they found beside how many they reported — and since issue #356 so does
	 * the uncapped drug-in-play arm, where neither of these stated one AND the question resolved a drug
	 * it could screen (issue #370, ADR Decision 71) — on the answer as
	 * {@code ChartAnswer.getPairChipExtent()} and on the wire as {@code interactionPairs}. This
	 * javadoc used to say a clinician-facing "10 of 72 shown" needed a per-question container the chip
	 * API does not have and was therefore a frontend change; the premise was half right and the
	 * conclusion wrong. The CHIP array has no such container — chips are per-drug findings — but the
	 * RESPONSE is itself the per-question container, and a key beside {@code safetyWarnings} is a
	 * module change. Rendering "10 of 18 shown" is still the frontend's, in
	 * {@code openmrs-esm-chartsearchai}; having something to render is not. What the WARN still holds
	 * alone is WHICH pairs went, and their ratings — the statement is a count, deliberately, because a
	 * list of withheld pairs on the wire is the uncapped prompt expansion this cap exists to prevent.
	 *
	 * <p><b>One honest limit on "most severe first":</b> {@link #severityPriority} sorts an UNRATED rule
	 * above Major, matching {@code DrugReferenceInjector.InteractionNote} and for the same reason —
	 * {@link #clearsSeverityFloor} treats unrated as exempt rather than low, so unrated is not rankable
	 * below a rated tier. Composed with a cap that DISCARDS, it means a dataset mixing unrated and rated
	 * rules can withhold a Major pair while reporting an unrated one. That needs an operator-authored
	 * dataset carrying both kinds (every DDInter row is rated; every curated rule is unrated, so neither
	 * bundled source mixes them) AND more above-floor pairs on one chart than the configured cap.
	 * <b>The injector is a second such cap since issue #355</b> and no longer merely decides who keeps
	 * mechanism prose: with nothing patient-specific shown its tail is truncated at
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.MAX_TAIL_PARTNERS_WHEN_NOTHING_PATIENT_SPECIFIC}, so five unrated curated rules
	 * on one entry can push a rated partner out of the record entirely, visible only as a withheld
	 * count. The WARN line is what makes
	 * it recoverable, and picking the other order would instead discard an operator's own hand-authored
	 * rule in favour of a third-party rating — which is why the convention is shared with the injector
	 * rather than reversed here.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It bounds CHIPS and not WORK, and that is settled rather than pending</b> (issue #256).
	 * Every candidate pair is enumerated and evaluated before the cut, because the cut is defined as
	 * "the least severe go" and nothing knows a pair's rating until it has been evaluated — so an
	 * early stop would change WHICH pairs are dropped, which is the one property this cap exists to
	 * guarantee. Asking whether it could stop early was #256's own discriminator, and the answer is no.
	 * <b>It also does not matter</b>, which is the part worth recording here: measured through the real
	 * {@code validate} over the shipped knowledge base, the SAME question against a chart with no
	 * active orders at all costs 30 ms of a 490 ms ten-drug pass on a 43-order chart, roughly 6% — and
	 * that 30 ms is the drug-in-play arms and the pairwise ones together, so it is an upper bound on
	 * these rather than a measurement of them. What grew with the question was the co-medication
	 * resolution the arms above run per in-play substance — see {@link CoMedications}, which is where
	 * #256's fix went. Do not re-derive the misreading from the cap's name.
	 *

	 *         Moderate chip against that order with this widening reverted, raises none with it. So
	 *         "try a different NSAID", the commonest alternative-proposal shape after an NSAID
	 *         question, is inside the residue. Two cases pin the two shapes so both read as decisions
	 *         rather than discoveries: {@code DrugSafetyValidatorEchoScopingTest
	 *         .aPartnerTheAnswerProposesRatherThanRecitesIsWithheldToo} for a rendered partner, and
	 *         {@code .aSubstanceNamedOnlyInsideARenderedMechanismParagraphIsWithheldToo} for a name
	 *         the record carries only as mechanism prose.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Say what the two bounds do and do not reach, because reciting them as if they
	 *         covered the class is the error to avoid.</b> A question-named X never reaches this
	 *         method ({@code questionDrugs.contains(ref) -> continue}), and an actively-ordered X
	 *         keeps its CONTRAINDICATION check through {@link #addActiveOrderContraindications} —
	 *         and an exempted drug may well be actively ordered, since an injected record names the
	 *         patient's own prescriptions. What NEITHER bound reaches is a drug that is neither, and
	 *         there the exemption takes the drug out of {@code inPlay} altogether: the interaction,
	 *         overdose AND drug-in-play contraindication arms all iterate that set, so an uncited
	 *         answer proposing a drug she is allergic to raises no chip where the drug is one an
	 *         injected record names. That is issue #105's settled trade rather than a new one —
	 *         {@code ActiveOrderContraindicationTest
	 *         .aRecitedPartnerThePatientIsNotTakingGainsNoContraindicationCheck} pins the same
	 *         withholding for a CITED record as the desired behaviour, since chipping there would be
	 *         a contraindication about a drug nobody proposed. What issue #360 changes is that it no
	 *         longer depends on a bracket. The bound that does hold is that the alternative is worse:
	 *         deciding it any other way needs evidence the answer RECITED the name rather than
	 *         proposed it, and
	 *         the one such signal available — text the answer reproduces from the record — is refuted
	 *         by measurement on the real chart, where the model paraphrases and misspells the very
	 *         reference prose it is copying. {@code ReferenceProseFidelityCheck} (issue #337) exists
	 *         because reproduce-then-rewrite is a shape the model actually produces; a rule resting on

	 *
	 *         <p><b>The containment with {@link SubjectMatter} survives the widening, by a different
	 *         argument.</b> It used to rest on {@code validate} handing this method's own corpus to the
	 *         {@code SubjectMatter} constructor, and since issue #360 it does not — the arm keeps the
	 *         CITED half and this reads the wider one, deliberately, because an injected record renders
	 *         this module's own contraindication clauses and would otherwise satisfy that arm's FINDING
	 *         side (issue #143). The containment holds anyway and without reference to the corpus:
	 *         every {@code ref} that reaches this method came from
	 *         {@code DrugReferenceService.findImpliedByQuery(answer)}, documented as returning "a
	 *         subset of {@code findByQuery}", so the ANSWER names it — and {@code SubjectMatter}'s
	 *         texts always contain the answer. So this returning true still implies
	 *         {@code SubjectMatter.names(ref)}, and a later change has to preserve THAT: WIDENING
	 *         {@code findImpliedByQuery} to return entries the prose does not name would reopen issue
	 *         #143 with nothing going red.
	 *
	 *         <p>The second half of the bound USED to be asserted here of "the order-driven arms", and
	 *         was false (issue #143). Counted over this class, those arms — {@link #addInteractionWarnings},
	 *         {@link #addQuestionPairInteractions}, {@link #addActiveOrderPairInteractions} — read the
	 *         allergy list ZERO times, because what they check is INTERACTIONS; the contraindication
	 *         arms read allergies but only ever about the drug in play. Nothing joined the two, so a
	 *         prescribed drug the patient was allergic to lost its contraindication to this exemption:
	 *         measured on the bundled curated dataset, an active ibuprofen order plus an ibuprofen
	 *         allergy, a question naming no drug and an answer citing the {@code drug_order} record
	 *         gave 0 chips where the same call with null mappings gave 2. What this exemption still
	 *         withholds is a finding about an echoed drug from any arm that iterates the drugs-in-play
	 *         set — interaction, overdose, and the drug-in-play contraindication arms alike. This used
	 *         to say "an INTERACTION or OVERDOSE finding", which reads as a bound and is not one: the
	 *         contraindication arm restored above is the ACTIVE-ORDER one, so a drug that is neither
	 *         question-named nor ordered loses its contraindication check too. The accepted-trade-off

	 * What THIS response is about: the question, the answer, and the records the answer cited.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why the active-order contraindication arm needs one.</b> chartsearchai answers questions;
	 * it is not an alerting system, and this class's own contract is a check that runs after the
	 * answer and ANNOTATES it. Issue #143 widened one arm past that: it walked every active order
	 * against every recorded allergy and condition <em>whatever the question and the answer named</em>.
	 * Measured live on the 3.7.1 standalone, four different questions — about allergies, interactions,
	 * cancer and a date of birth — returned the same two contraindication chips byte for byte. The
	 * finding is the INVARIANCE, not that all four were off-topic: two of them were squarely about
	 * drugs. The chips simply did not depend on what was asked, which is how a reader learns to skip
	 * the box. The finding it was carrying is real, and since issue #280 it has a surface of its own:
	 * {@link #standingChartAlerts(Patient)}, which a client ASKS for. So this reasoning is unchanged
	 * — nothing here opens unprompted, and no answer carries a finding with no claim on it — and what
	 * that surface still does not carry is subscription or acknowledgement STATE, which stays order
	 * entry's, a chart banner's or a CDS hook's.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Both sides count, and that is the point.</b> A contraindication relates a DRUG to a
	 * recorded FINDING, and either can be what was asked about. Scoped to the drug alone it would lose
	 * a chip whose allergy is the subject and whose drug is never written; scoped to the finding alone
	 * it would lose issue #143's own case, a prescribed drug named only by the cited {@code drug_order}
	 * record that issue #105's echo rule keeps out of the in-play set.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The three widenings are signals, never gates.</b> A medication-domain question makes the
	 * whole active-order list subject matter, and an allergy- or conditions-domain question makes the
	 * corresponding recorded findings subject matter, because there the LIST is the topic even where the
	 * prose writes no individual name. All three go through {@link QueryScopeRouter}'s own
	 * classification rather than a second vocabulary here. None can narrow anything: a question naming a
	 * drug outright carries no cue word at all ("Can I give her bupivacaine?") and is answered by the
	 * drug-in-play arm before this one runs.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Three and not two, and one per LIST.</b> A contraindication's recorded side is an allergy
	 * OR a condition, so the argument above reads identically for both and leaving conditions out made
	 * the gate asymmetric for a reason nobody could state: "does she have any allergies?" promoted a
	 * finding into the prompt and "what conditions does she have?" did not. Where that bit is the
	 * pre-answer pass, which has no answer text at all — with an answer, an enumeration usually spells
	 * the condition out and {@link PatientClinicalContext#containsToken} reaches it unaided. They stay
	 * three separate signals rather than one "asks about her chart", because a conditions question that
	 * also put her allergy records in scope would be the reported defect again one level up.

	/**
	 * What one RESPONSE calls each substance a {@code validate} pass resolved: {@link #interactionSubject}
	 * over the rows the question and the patient's own orders resolved for that substance, asked once and
	 * remembered — for a substance those rows reach at all. Not over the rows the ANSWER put in play for
	 * such a substance — those decide what the arms RULE on and not what they call it, which is issue
	 * #238 — see the paragraph beginning "And issue #238 makes the fold invariant". That is the ordinary
	 * case and not a universal one: a substance in play ONLY because the answer named it has no such rows
	 * to remember, and for exactly that substance {@link #groupOf} folds its answer-only rows instead — see that
	 * method's own javadoc, which states the narrower, correct claim.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Issue #206.</b> Five arms of this class name a subject. Three read this — the drug-in-play
	 * interaction chip (issue #162), the dose warning (#174 site 4) and the contraindication chip — and
	 * the third of them answered POSITIONALLY, keeping whichever row reached it first. On the shipped KB
	 * that disagreed with the other two for the families whose route-unspecified row is not the dataset's
	 * first; since issue #194 anchored the other two on the chart it disagreed wherever the CHART names
	 * some other row, which is a property of the patient's data rather than of the dataset. Either way
	 * one response called one substance two things.
	 *
	 * <p>A shared lookup rather than three calls to one method, because equal answers from three call
	 * sites are equal only while their INPUTS stay equal: the row group and the recorded names are both
	 * arguments, and it is a narrowed row set at one site that this class's own history says to expect
	 * (issues #162, #174, #175 are all "this arm was handed fewer rows than that one"). For every arm
	 * that reads this — three at #206, all five since #236 — the group is looked up rather than passed,
	 * so a caller cannot supply a different one.
	 *
	 * <p><b>All five arms read it, since issue #236.</b> The two pairwise arms
	 * ({@link #addQuestionPairInteractions}, {@link #addActiveOrderPairInteractions}) resolved their own
	 * subject over that arm's OWN rows — the question's drugs and the order-resolved entries respectively
	 * — and since issue #175 those are never WIDER than the group here, which also carries the rows the
	 * CHART resolved. So a substance the question names by a word only one of its rows publishes, and
	 * whose other rows the chart or the answer resolves, was named one thing by a pair chip and another
	 * by every other chip in the same response. Measured through the real {@code validate} over
	 * {@code drug-reference-charted-substance-row.json}: {@code Amoxicillin interacts with Warfarin, also
	 * named in the question} beside {@code The stated Amoxicillin (suspension) dose ~4000 mg/day …}, one
	 * substance, two names, one response ({@code OrderedSubjectRowTest
	 * .theQuestionPairChipNamesTheSubstanceTheOtherArmsName}).
	 *
	 * <p>What neither arm lost is how it chooses which RULE to quote, and that is a different mechanism in
	 * each: {@link #substanceRows} over its own order list for the screening arm, and — for the
	 * question-pair arm, which calls {@code substanceRows} nowhere — candidates keyed by
	 * {@link #pairKeyNames}/{@link #unorderedPairKey} and ranked by {@link #outranks} on the walked ROW.
	 * Both are #175's and #189's axis and both move chip COUNTS. Only the NAME moved.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The shared {@code namingGroups}/{@code allGroups} lookup is what makes that structural rather
	 * than coincidental</b>, and the memo is not: {@link #subjectOf} is {@link #interactionSubject} over
	 * {@link #groupOf}{@code (substance)} and {@code recordedNames}, both fixed for the pass and folded by
	 * a pure static method, so every arm gets the same answer whoever asks first. What the memo buys is
	 * that no arm REFOLDS a group another has
	 * already folded — including within one arm, which is why {@link #addContraindications} may ask once
	 * per MATCHED rule (see its own comment there), and within one iteration of {@code validate}'s
	 * drug-in-play loop, where the interaction and dose arms ask about the same substance in turn.
	 * Measured by deleting the {@code put}: the whole api suite stays green, so it is a cost property and
	 * nothing about the one-name-per-substance property rests on it.
	 *
	 * <p><b>And issue #238 makes the fold invariant to the ANSWER within each pass — never a shared answer
	 * across the whole REQUEST, which is why the rows this folds are not the rows the arms rule
	 * over.</b> {@code validate} runs twice for one {@code /search} — the pre-answer findings pass
	 * through {@code DrugReferenceInjector.injectRecords}, then the chips pass. Before this issue, the
	 * group differed between them precisely in the rows the ANSWER put in play (issue #175 admits them
	 * deliberately): where the answer resolved a row of an in-play substance that the question did not,
	 * the group grew for that pass alone, so the injected {@code safety_finding} the model READ could
	 * name a substance one way and the chip beside the answer another. {@code namingRows} closes that —
	 * it folds only {@code questionDrugs} and {@code orderEntries}, neither of which the answer-side
	 * widening touches, so the two passes now fold the identical rows for the identical substance. By
	 * design, not in total: {@code orderEntries} is read from the pass's own
	 * {@link PatientClinicalContext} exactly as the recorded names are, so an order that stops during
	 * the LLM call still moves that input between the two passes — see the paragraph beginning "And the
	 * question-pair arm since issue #236", which says the same thing of the recorded names. That is a
	 * chart-read residue #238 does not close, not the answer-driven one this paragraph is about.
	 *
	 * <p><b>And the question-pair arm since issue #236</b>, which is what that change COST until issue
	 * #238 closed it. Folding this arm's own rows made it invariant to the ANSWER —
	 * {@code questionDrugs} is a function of the question, which both passes share — and that is the
	 * only sense of "pass-stable" this paragraph and the one below claim, for either arm. Not
	 * byte-identical across the passes, which nothing here ever established: the two passes build two
	 * {@link PatientClinicalContext}s, so the recorded names this fold ranks by could already move
	 * between them for reasons that have nothing to do with #236. So the injected
	 * {@code safety_finding} the model reads and the chip beside the answer COULD name that substance
	 * differently — the residue the paragraph above already accepted for three arms, on a fourth. ADR
	 * Decision 49 is canonical for the measurement that showed it live. <b>That residue is closed as of
	 * issue #238 (ADR Decision 53), for this arm along with the other three</b>: every substance this
	 * arm asks {@link #subjectOf} about is one of {@code questionDrugs}, which {@code namingGroups}
	 * always covers, so its naming decision never falls through to {@code allGroups}'s answer-widened
	 * rows and the ANSWER cannot move it. What #238 did not touch is the caveat two sentences up — a
	 * chart read that genuinely differs between the two passes is a different residue from the one this
	 * paragraph is about.
	 *
	 * <p>The SCREENING arm keeps its pass-stability, and structurally rather than by luck: on a
	 * screening question {@code questionDrugs} is empty by the arm's own gate — see the paragraph
	 * beginning "That is a statement about the screening arm's OWN chips" — so its {@code namingRows}
	 * reduces to {@code resolvedSubstanceRows(<empty set>, orderEntries)}: byte-for-byte the same map
	 * the arm already builds for itself, {@code substanceRows(orderDrugs)}, same membership and the same
	 * order (see the comment at that arm's own read, near {@code substances = substanceRows(orderDrugs)}).
	 * {@link InteractionPairs} plays no part in this — it dedups PAIRS the drug-in-play arm already
	 * reported, never subject groups — so every pair this arm still reports has a subject whose group is
	 * the orders' alone.
	 *
	 * <p>That is a statement about the screening arm's OWN chips and not about a screening QUESTION,
	 * which the sentence above would otherwise be read as. This javadoc used to say the pair this arm
	 * stands down from is chipped by {@link #addInteractionWarnings} instead, "whose subject is folded
	 * over the answer-widened group", so the pre-answer finding could come from here and the post-answer
	 * chip from there, naming one substance two ways across the arm handoff. <b>That cannot happen, as of
	 * issue #238.</b> The substance a pair like this is about is an ORDERED one —
	 * {@code questionDrugs} is empty by this arm's own gate, so every substance the screening arm reaches
	 * is one {@code orderEntries} names — and {@code namingGroups}, built from
	 * {@code orderEntries} alone, always has that substance's group. The two arms
	 * therefore fold the identical group for that substance in both passes.
	 *
	 * <p>A PARTNER-label asymmetry used to survive at that handoff, and issue #339 closed it: an
	 * unfolded chip from {@link #addInteractionWarnings} named its partner by the rule's own match token
	 * while a folded one named it by {@link #reconciledPartnerName}, so one prescription answered to two
	 * names depending on whether a class sentence had folded onto the chip — measured across the two
	 * arms, the same pair read {@code active order Diclofenac} for a drug-in-play question and
	 * {@code active order diclofenac} for a screening one. Both arms now put that same question through
	 * {@link #reconciledPartnerFor}, so the asymmetry is not answer-driven and is no longer arm-driven
	 * either. What is left is where that method declines to answer — an order the loaded dataset covers
	 * no entry for — and it declines identically in both arms.
	 *
	 * <p>This javadoc used to reject closing that gap here at all, calling it "not designed around, and
	 * the alternative is worse" on two grounds: that naming from a pass-invariant set while RULING from
	 * the whole group is the two-row-sets shape this class exists to remove, one level up; and that
	 * closing it properly means deciding a substance's subject once per REQUEST rather than once per
	 * pass, which is the injector's and the inference service's business rather than this class's.
	 * <b>Both grounds are wrong, and each for its own reason (ADR Decision 53) — it is the REJECTION that
	 * is retracted below, not the gap, which #238 closes inside this class.</b>
	 *
	 * <p>The two-row-sets ground is wrong: the shape issues #162/#174/#175 removed is arms RULING from
	 * different row sets, whose harm is a milder rule surviving where a more severe one existed (issue
	 * #86's direction), and no arm's candidate set moves here. Naming from a set narrower than the one
	 * that decides content is moreover already this module's design, stated for the out-of-class caller
	 * in {@link #interactionSubject(List, PatientClinicalContext)}'s own javadoc — "deliberately NOT the
	 * narrower set it decides to INJECT … what a substance is CALLED may not depend on them" — and the set
	 * this folds IS the union that caller asks over.
	 *
	 * <p>The "injector's and the inference service's business" ground is wrong too: of every input the
	 * naming decision reads, exactly one varies between the two passes from INSIDE {@code validate} —
	 * {@code answer}. The question is the same string at both call sites; {@code orderEntries} is
	 * {@code findForActiveOrders(rawContext)}, reading the order's ATC codes and
	 * {@code getActiveDrugNames()}, neither of which the answer-side widening touches; and
	 * {@code recordedDrugNames(context)} is {@code getActiveDrugNames()} again. So the pass-varying input
	 * can be, and is, removed INSIDE {@code validate} — per pass, with nothing carried between the two
	 * passes and no new parameter on the public entry point — which is exactly what {@code namingRows}
	 * does. Closing this was never the injector's or the inference service's business to begin with; it
	 * needed no cross-pass carrier at all.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it does cost, stated because it is a real trade.</b> {@link #addOverdose} tries the
	 * SUBJECT's own band first, so moving the subject moves which of a substance's published ceilings a
	 * dose chip quotes: over a fixture whose rows publish 3000 and 2000 mg/day, a stated 4000 mg/day is
	 * now reported against the named row's own 3000 rather than the answer-widened subject's 2000. That
	 * ceiling has followed the subject since #206 by that arm's own design, no warning is lost (the walk
	 * after the subject still reaches every row, and {@link #ceilingAttribution} says whose ceiling it
	 * quoted), and the alternative would have the dose arm name a substance differently from the other
	 * two, which is this class's whole reason to exist. Both directions are pinned by
	 * {@code PerRequestSubstanceSubjectTest}.
	 *
	 * <p>Still narrow to reach, and still reasoned rather than counted: it needs a family whose rows
	 * publish DIFFERENT alias sets, so that a question and an answer using different aliases resolve
	 * different rows. This used to name {@code Estrone sulfate (topical)} as such a family, on the
	 * strength of its publishing {@code estrone}; measured through the real
	 * {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource.parse} of the shipped knowledge base, that family does NOT pose it —
	 * its unqualified sibling publishes {@code estrone} too, because the {@code ddinter} parser builds
	 * both rows' aliases from one {@code rxnorm_name}. So the shape wants a curated
	 * {@code sourceFormat=json} dataset, which is what {@code PerRequestSubstanceSubjectTest}'s fixture
	 * is, or a {@code ddinter} family whose {@code rxnorm_name} is not word-bounded inside the display
	 * name (the {@code Omeprazole}/{@code esomeprazole} shape). No live instance was ever observed, and
	 * no count over the shipped KB is published here — the property is that the two passes stop disagreeing
	 * over {@code answer}, which does not depend on how often they would otherwise have differed.
	 *
	 * <p>Memoised for the pass and not beyond it, which #238 does not change: each pass resolves the rows
	 * and the recorded names for itself, so the memo may not outlive the pass that built it. The memo below IS a field, of an object
	 * {@code validate} constructs per pass — which is the shape issue #172's rule asks for, and the rule
	 * binds the step
	 * this must never take: hoisting it onto the VALIDATOR, where {@link DrugReferenceService}'s class
	 * javadoc gives the reasons. Not the {@code getAll()} hot-reload this used to cite, which does not
	 * exist.
	 *
	 * <p><b>One instance per pass, and that is now pinned rather than described.</b> Every property above
	 * rests on the arms sharing ONE of these, which nothing stated until
	 * {@code ChipSubjectOneResolutionTest} began asserting that {@code new SubstanceSubjects(} appears once
	 * in this file and inside {@code validate}. An arm re-constructing this over its own row group needs no
	 * call to {@link #interactionSubject}, so the caller scan beside it does not see that edit — and it is
	 * exactly issue #236's split, in the class written to close it.

	/**
	 * Every contraindication chip one {@code validate} pass raises: <b>at most one per (substance,
	 * recorded finding)</b>, whatever arm reaches it and however many reference rows the loaded
	 * dataset files that substance as (issue #145).
	 *
	 * <p><b>The defect.</b> Both contraindication arms are keyed on a subject ENTRY, and DDInter files
	 * one substance as several route/formulation rows. One clinician-facing string resolves all of them
	 * — a candidate set is every ROW of each substance the string names, and every row of a substance
	 * publishes the same aliases — so one clinical fact became one chip per row. Measured live on
	 * the 3.7.1 standalone: a recorded dexamethasone allergy asked about dexamethasone gave FOUR chips,
	 * and only the row {@link DrugReferenceService#lookupByToken} resolved the allergy to matched by
	 * identity, so the other three fell through to the class comparison and reported the substance as
	 * cross-reactive with the patient's allergy to <em>itself</em>. Since issue #110 every chip
	 * is also injected as a citable pre-answer record, so each duplicate reached the prompt as well.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why a ledger rather than a filter over the finished chip list.</b> Three reasons, and the
	 * first is the decisive one. (1) The sibling's chip is not merely a duplicate, it is WRONG — the
	 * true statement about that substance is the identity one — so the collapse has to choose which
	 * relationship survives, and by the time only rendered text is left the reasons are gone. (2) Those
	 * chips differ in text (each names its own route), so an exact-repeat key over the rendered chip
	 * cannot see them; recognising "differs only in a route qualifier" from the strings alone means
	 * pattern-matching a display label, which is the mistake issue #148 had to undo. (3) The two arms
	 * run at two call sites — the drug-in-play loop and {@link #addActiveOrderContraindications} — and
	 * a collapse inside either one leaves the other emitting the siblings, which is Sarah Taylor's live
	 * shape (one hydrocortisone order, four rows, four chips, question naming no drug).
	 *
	 * <p><b>The key.</b> {@code (subject substance, recorded finding)}. The subject side is
	 * {@link DrugReference#substanceKey()}, which is where the measurement behind it lives and why it
	 * is not simply the dataset's substance name; an entry from a source publishing none keys on its
	 * own identity, so no two ROWS group for the {@code atc} adapter or the shipped curated
	 * {@code json} dataset — the FINDING side still folds there, which is what the paragraph after
	 * next is about. The finding side is what the arm actually compared — the resolved allergen's
	 * SUBSTANCE for the allergy arm, by the same {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()} as the
	 * subject side, and the curated rule's own {@code (type, token)} for the rule arm.
	 * Those stay two key spaces, and the reason is unchanged: a rule's token is free text that may name a
	 * CLASS ({@code nsaid}, {@code aminoglycoside}) rather than a drug, so resolving tokens to entries
	 * wholesale in order to make the two arms comparable would collapse a class-level rule into an
	 * identity chip — a different and worse defect. What keeps the two spaces from colliding is no longer
	 * their TYPE — the allergy finding used to be a {@link DrugReference}, which defines no
	 * {@code equals}, and is now usually a {@link List} like the rule's — but their LENGTH, two against
	 * three, plus the rule's leading {@code "rule"} tag. Both are needed: a substance key that grew a
	 * third component would collide on length alone.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The one rule that crosses (issue #146).</b> An allergy rule whose token is one of the SUBJECT
	 * ENTRY'S OWN names reports the allergy arm's fact — the patient is allergic to this very drug — so
	 * it is filed in the allergy arm's key space instead of the rule one, and the two collapse. On
	 * {@code sourceFormat=json} — the shipped default when this was measured, and since ADR Decision 36
	 * the format a deployment selects for dosing — that shape is 3 of the file's 4 entries (Gentamicin's
	 * allergy rule names a class, which is why it was the control), and each of the three double-reported
	 * one allergy: {@code Ibuprofen is contraindicated by an active allergy: documented ibuprofen
	 * allergy} beside {@code The patient has a recorded allergy to Ibuprofen.} — with no non-default
	 * configuration needed to see it. What is keyed is the FACT and never "both
	 * arms fired", which is what leaves a class-level rule its own chip beside the folded one for a
	 * patient recorded as allergic to both the drug and its class.
	 *
	 * <p>The test is name IDENTITY between two REFERENCE strings — a curated token against the entry's
	 * own alias list — so it is {@link DrugReference#isNamed}, the same predicate {@link #namesEntry}
	 * asks of an interaction rule's token. Deliberately NOT
	 * {@link DrugReferenceService#findImpliedSubstances}: that answers which substances a RECORDED name
	 * denotes and widens deliberately (issues #193/#195/#209), and applying it to a curated token is
	 * exactly the wholesale resolution the paragraph above rules out. The fold is bounded to its own
	 * subject by WHOM the question is asked OF, not by the predicate — {@code isNamed} is true of every
	 * entry aliasing the token — and it is asked of the entry the rule is filed on, keying on that
	 * entry's substance, so no rule can fold onto any other.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Which chip survives.</b> The most specific relationship, since that is this arm's analogue
	 * of "the highest severity wins" — a contraindication chip carries no severity, and what it can
	 * under-report is the STRENGTH of the claim: identity (the patient is allergic to this very drug)
	 * over a shared ATC class over a shared curated group. Identity is the RELATIONSHIP and not a fixed
	 * wording — since issue #268 that rank states it in one of two sentences, depending on whether the
	 * recorded name names the row. Where a self-named curated rule joins that
	 * space it is ranked by what it ADDS, not by which arm produced it — issue #88's finding that "arm X
	 * yields to arm Y" is the wrong dedup whenever the yielding arm can be the one carrying the content.
	 * A rule with a note of its own says the identity fact in the deployment's own words and outranks it;
	 * a rule with none renders its own token back ({@link ChartSearchAiUtils#firstNonBlank}, "…:
	 * ibuprofen") and is outranked, so it survives only where the allergen arm resolved nothing to this
	 * SAME substance — a class or group chip about a DIFFERENT allergen is a different key and stands
	 * beside it. Since issue #223 a note is necessary and not sufficient: the allergy RECORD the rule
	 * matched must also NAME that drug, because the fold's premise is that it reports the allergen arm's
	 * fact and the match that files it here is bare containment. See {@link #contraindicationRank}, which is where
	 * the whole choice lives. Ties keep the incumbent, so a group of equally-related rows is reported
	 * with the dataset's first such row's CONTENT. The surviving chip is written back into the position the
	 * group's first candidate took, so no client sees the chip sequence reshuffle when a later, stronger
	 * row replaces an earlier one.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What the chip CALLS that substance is a separate question, and not a positional one (issue
	 * #206).</b> It is {@link SubstanceSubjects} — {@link #interactionSubject} over the substance's rows,
	 * the same answer the interaction chip (issue #162) and the dose warning (#174 site 4) get, resolved
	 * once for the pass and — since issue #238, the naming rows being a function of the question and the
	 * orders alone — no longer moved between the pre-answer pass and the chips pass by the ANSWER. This arm
	 * used to name the chip after whichever row reached it first, which
	 * disagreed with those two for the shipped families whose route-unspecified row is not the dataset's
	 * first, and — once issue #194 anchored them on the chart — wherever the chart names some other row,
	 * i.e. on a property of the patient's data rather than of the dataset. Renaming, not re-counting:
	 * every row of one substance answers {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()} alike, so moving the
	 * NAME to another row of the same group cannot move the key, which is why the subject is resolved
	 * through {@link ContraindicationChips#subjectOf} and handed to {@link ContraindicationChips#add} as
	 * the very row it keys on rather than resolved beside it.
	 *
	 * <p>The chip RANKED as identity is exempt, and stays named after the patient's own recorded
	 * allergen (issue #164): that sentence quotes an allergy RECORD, and naming the row the chart records
	 * is what makes a finding truthful — issue #187 settled it and #192 re-measured it at a charted
	 * {@code Ketorolac (ophthalmic)} allergy the fold renames wrongly. Both are chart-anchored, on
	 * different records; only the chips ASSERTING something about the drug being checked take the shared
	 * subject.
	 *
	 * <p>Resolving a tie by position is lossless rather than merely tidier, and that rests on the rows
	 * of one substance publishing the SAME ATC codes — which the shipped KB does for every group this
	 * key merges, and which is the thing to re-measure before widening the key, since the class chip
	 * names a code and a divergent row's code would be dropped unheard. Curated-group membership needs
	 * no separate check: {@link CrossReactivityGroup#groupsOf} is a pure function of those same codes,
	 * so equal codes are equal membership. What is left for a tie to choose between is then, since issue
	 * #206 took the label out of its hands and issue #146 put self-named rules in this space,
	 * one such rule's NOTE against another's, where an entry authors the same rule twice
	 * ({@code ContraindicationRouteVariantTest.oneCuratedRuleAuthoredTwiceRaisesOneChip}, whose comment
	 * records why the incumbent is the right survivor for a re-spelling and lossy for two genuinely
	 * different notes). Issue #176 widened the key's FINDING side onto the same
	 * substance, so that instruction was carried out: re-measured 2026-08-08 through
	 * {@link DrugReference#atcSubgroups()}, 0 of the 129 multi-row families publish differing level-4
	 * subgroups, and 0 differ in curated-group membership.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Replacing an incumbent, and what still reaches it.</b> This ledger used to be reachably
	 * order-dependent: an allergy resolves to ONE row of its substance and not necessarily the group's
	 * first — where no alias of a row is the bare substance name the allergy skips that row and resolves
	 * a LATER member of its own group — and the earlier members, matching by class rather than by
	 * identity, raised the weaker chip first ({@code Tozinameran} behind the {@code Pfizer-BioNTech}
	 * presentations, {@code Insulin aspart (aspart)}, {@code Iobenguane (I-131)}). Issue #164 removed
	 * that route: identity is now decided by SUBSTANCE, so every row of one group answers the identity
	 * question the same way and an identity chip can no longer arrive after a class one for the same
	 * key. Since issue #146 the replacement branch has a LIVE route again — a self-named rule outranks
	 * identity, and a dataset authoring that rule on a row that is not its family's first raises the
	 * identity chip before the rule reaches the same key, which
	 * {@code SelfNamedAllergyRuleFoldTest.aRuleOnALaterRowReplacesTheIdentityChipInPlace} exercises. So
	 * {@code warnings.set} is not dead code, whatever becomes of the class case below.
	 *
	 * <p>That class case is the OTHER thing left to replace: a class chip by a more specific class chip
	 * — a group whose rows publish DIFFERENT ATC codes, so that one shares only a curated group with
	 * the allergen while another shares a level-4 subgroup. The shipped KB has no such group (0 of the
	 * 129 it files as more than one row; measured 2026-08-07 and the same 0 before this key widened),
	 * so that branch alone is currently unexercised rather than wrong, and it is kept because "the
	 * most specific relationship survives" is this arm's contract and first-wins is not: a refresh that
	 * diverges one row's codes would otherwise silently report the weaker relationship. Re-measure that
	 * 0 rather than trusting it — it is a property of the dataset, not of this code.

		// already does. (That paragraph is about `subject`, which the walk below resolves; the pre-pass
		// between here and there is a separate concern and says so in its own comment.)

		// The corroboration answer for each collapsed CLAUSE of this entry, resolved before the walk
		// below and over the same unit the injected drug_reference record resolves it over: this
		// ENTRY's rules, folded by contraindicationFinding, one corroborated rule carrying the key,
		// and then — the record's own second stage — a clause TEXT another key of this entry states as
		// recorded, asked below both of the key's own rendered clause and of the sentence the finding
		// prints for the rule (issue #308, DrugReferenceInjector.contraindicationSections — a change to
		// either belongs in both). Two things about the scoping are load-bearing and each was measured
		// wrong first.
		//
		// It is per ENTRY and not per chip KEY. The ledger's key is the SUBSTANCE, so it spans every
		// ROW of it, while the injector injects ONE record for the substance and renders it for
		// canonicalRow's row — and on two rule-bearing rows of one substance a corroborated rule on the
		// sibling cleared the flag while the rendered row's own record went on hedging its own clause.
		// The residue that scoping leaves — the surviving SENTENCE can still be a row's the record does
		// not state — is declared in ADR Decision 44 and pinned by
		// UncorroboratedFindingProvenanceTest.aSiblingRowsSentenceOutranksTheRenderedRowsAndBringsItsOwnAnswer.
		//
		// And it ignores `askedAbout`. That gate decides which CHIPS this response may raise (issue
		// #143); whether the chart corroborates a match is a fact about the chart and not about what
		// was asked, and contraindicationSections asks it unscoped. Scoped, a corroborated rule the
		// question does not name is skipped before it can carry its key — the record then states the
		// clause while the finding beside it says nothing corroborates the match.
		//
		// The guard opening the loop — MATCHED rules only — is load-bearing too, and it is what
		// everything read off this map assumes. corroboratedByTheChart answers TRUE unconditionally for
		// an ALLERGY rule that is not self-named, and contraindicationClauses renders a clause for
		// every rule of the entry whether it matched or not, so an UNMATCHED rule reaching this fold
		// seeds its key TRUE, puts that key's clause into statedAsRecorded and clears a finding whose
		// record beside it goes on hedging the same string — issue #308's own contradiction, one rule
		// along, and nothing errors or changes a count when it happens. This loop and the walk below
		// open on the same recordedContraindicationKind call, so a later dedup pass that shares it is
		// the seam to watch. Delete the `continue` here, leaving `Object key = contraindicationFinding(
		// ref, c);` as the loop's first statement, and read the failure:
		// ConditionRuleBoundaryCorroborationTest.anUnmatchedRuleStillCannotSeedItsKeyAsRecorded.

		// WHICH rule type witnesses that is not incidental, and issue #309 moved it. The witness used to
		// be UncorroboratedFindingProvenanceTest.aRuleTheChartDoesNotRecordCannotStateItsClauseAsRecorded,
		// whose unmatched rule is a CONDITION rule — and #309 gave condition rules a corroborating leg
		// of their own, so an unmatched one now answers FALSE rather than TRUE and the mutation stopped
		// reddening it. Measured on the commit that added the leg (whole api suite green under the
		// mutation) and on its parent (that case red). The witness named above is an unmatched allergy
		// rule that is NOT self-named. Read corroboratedByTheChart for which rules answer TRUE
		// unconditionally rather than trusting a list here — it is every rule the first two branches
		// fall through, and enumerating those has gone stale on this branch already. Two things about
		// this witness are worth stating because they are not obvious from that method. A self-named
		// allergy rule can witness the guard too, but never unconditionally: only through leg 2,
		// allergicSubstanceKeys, which reads the whole allergy list rather than this rule's own

	/**
	 * @return how specific a relationship a MATCHED contraindication rule states, in
	 *         {@link ContraindicationChips}' ordering — the whole of what decides whether a curated rule
	 *         may speak in the identity chip's place. Called only from the walk above, so {@code c} has
	 *         already matched; each constant's javadoc carries its own justification and none of it is
	 *         restated here.
	 *
	 *         <p>A rule that does not name its own entry keeps its own key space and never competes with
	 *         the identity ranks at all. One that does — issue #146's fold — is ranked by what it ADDS to
	 *         the identity sentence, and that is now two questions rather than one:
	 *
	 *         <ul>
	 *         <li><b>Does it have anything of its own to say?</b> A blank note renders the rule's own
	 *         token back and says strictly less than identity ({@link ChartSearchAiUtils#firstNonBlank}).
	 *         <li><b>Is the record it fired on one the chart reads as this drug?</b> (Issue #223.) The
	 *         fold's premise is that such a rule reports {@link #addAllergyContraindications}'s fact, and
	 *         the match that put it there is {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasAllergyToken}'s bare
	 *         containment — deliberately bare, because a curated token may name a CLASS or a fragment of
	 *         free text, and that is measured as the right rule for those (see
	 *         {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasAllergyToken}). What containment does not say is WHICH
	 *         allergy record the token reached, so the witnesses are asked for
	 *         ({@link PatientClinicalContext#allergensMatching}) and each is put to the entry by the
	 *         accessor for a clinician-entered drug NAME, {@link DrugReference#matchesDrugName}. Without
	 *         that an allergen recorded as {@code Tiotropium} let an {@code Opium} rule replace the
	 *         sentence a genuine, separately recorded opium allergy had raised. That walk is
	 *         {@link #aMatchedRecordNamesTheEntry}, which the injected record's reading reads too
	 *         (issue #269) — everything said about it in the paragraphs here is said of that method.
	 *         </ul>
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Per witness, and against the ENTRY rather than the token</b> — both halves measured,
	 *         because the obvious narrower rule ("does some allergen name what the TOKEN names") demotes
	 *         a rule it must not: an entry whose own names include {@code thyroxine}, ruling on that
	 *         name, for a patient whose recorded allergy is {@code Levothyroxine}. The token sits
	 *         mid-word there, so the token-scoped question answers no — while the entry itself publishes
	 *         the name the chart used, the allergen arm raises its identity chip for that very substance,
	 *         and the operator's note is the one thing in the response that says what the reaction was.
	 *         Asking it per witness is the other half: the entry-scoped question over the whole allergy
	 *         list would be satisfied by {@code Papaveretum} while the rule had actually fired on
	 *         {@code Tiotropium}, which is issue #223 again with a longer proof.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>The rejected alternative, measured.</b> The same question can be asked with the
	 *         allergen arm's OWN resolver — {@code findImpliedSubstances(witness)} reaching
	 *         {@code ref.substanceGroupKey()}, i.e. literally "would that arm raise its identity chip from
	 *         this record". Built and run: <b>outcome-identical over the whole suite</b> (1194 tests, 0
	 *         failures, 2026-08-14), so nothing constructible separates them. This one is kept because the
	 *         question here is the one CLAUDE.md's three-shapes rule settles — a recorded allergen against
	 *         an entry is a clinician-entered NAME, which is {@link DrugReference#matchesDrugName}'s shape
	 *         — and because it is an alias walk rather than a dataset sweep per witness. What the
	 *         alternative would buy, stated so the next reader has it: {@code matchesDrugName} is
	 *         ROW-scoped where this ledger's key is SUBSTANCE-scoped, so a row that omits its SUBSTANCE's
	 *         bare name from its aliases would be demoted for an allergy recorded under a sibling row's
	 *         name. Nothing reports that shape: {@link DrugReferenceValidity#ENTRY_NOT_NAMED_BY_ITS_OWN_ALIASES}
	 *         is keyed on an entry's OWN display name — which it repairs, or since issue #296 reports
	 *         where that name names nothing — so a row named by its own alias and not by its family's is
	 *         silent. Re-measure before swapping:
	 *         the swap also silently makes this rank depend on {@code findImpliedSubstances}' NARROWING,
	 *         which demotes a rule filed on an entry publishing a borrowed alias.
	 *
	 *         <p>Ranked and not gated, which is the same choice issue #146 made for the note: the arms
	 *         fire on different evidence and this one was never conditional on the other, so a rule no
	 *         recorded allergy names still chips where nothing else reports the drug — it simply cannot
	 *         outrank something that does. Tightening the MATCH instead was measured and declined; the
	 *         corpus and the 5 names it would cost are on {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasAllergyToken}.

	 *
	 *         <p><b>A boundary, not a resolution, and that is the whole design.</b> Issue #309 says the

	 *         {@link DrugReference#matchesDrugName}, {@link #allergicSubstanceKeys} through the allergen

	 *         ticket's own conclusion — that a fix must therefore wait on a resolver — does not follow.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>{@link DrugReference#containsWord} and deliberately not
	 *         {@link DrugReference#matchesOrderName}.</b> The condition haystack is prose in the

	 *         operand shape. The order-name rule's two-letter tail allowance is measured over drug

	 *         not ship: a prefix or suffix compound that is clinically the same finding, pinned by

	 *         It does not: {@link DrugReference#containsWord} is strictly stronger than the containment
	 *         those witnesses are filtered by, so any condition carrying the token as a word is already
	 *         one of them. Measured by mutation — swapping this loop to
	 *         {@code context.getConditionTokens()} reddens nothing. Stated because the allergy leg's own
	 *         per-witness form IS load-bearing ({@code matchesDrugName} can accept a record that
	 *         {@code hasAllergyToken} did not match), so the symmetry invites the reader to assume the
	 *         same of this one. What the witness form buys here is a future question this leg cannot yet
	 *         ask — WHICH recorded condition redeemed the match — and a boundary rule weaker than
	 *         containment, for which the filter would start to matter.

	 *         question did not — so a curated rule whose token carried stray whitespace found its
	 *         witness and then failed to match it, losing the recorded attribution it had before issue
	 *         #309. Silently, and reachable from an operator's own file, since nothing in
	 *         {@code DrugReferenceValidity} trims or reports a padded token. A normalization and not a
	 *         widening: the trimmed token still goes to the whole-word rule.
	 *         {@code ConditionRuleBoundaryCorroborationTest.aPaddedTokenIsPutToTheSameStringItsWitnessFilterTrimmed}
	 *         holds both halves.

	 *         <p><b>Prompt-facing as issue #309 shipped it, and that was the LIMIT of its fix rather
	 *         than merely its scope.</b> The chip arm's own answer was unmoved, so on the ticket's
	 *         reproduction the injected record and the {@code safety_finding} hedged while the

	/**
	 * Every interaction chip one SUBSTANCE raises about the patient's own medications: <b>one chip per
	 * (substance, active order) pair</b>, with the two arms that can each raise one — the rule arm
	 * ({@link #bestRulePerPartner}) and the class arm ({@link #classRelationships}) — coordinated
	 * instead of run independently (issue #88).
	 *
	 * <p>Per PARTNER, to be exact, and one active order can be several: the rule arm keys on the partner
	 * ENTRY, so a fixed-dose combination prescription whose constituents both carry a rule is two chips
	 * about one order — two clinical facts, deliberately kept apart. What is collapsed is only a chip
	 * that repeats another word for word, which the issue #339 reconciliation made reachable by naming
	 * both after the prescription; see {@link StatedInteractionChips}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The subject is a substance, not a reference row (issue #162).</b> This ran once per entry in
	 * the drugs-in-play set, and {@link #bestRulePerPartner} groups per PARTNER within one subject, so the
	 * subject side was never grouped at all: one clinician word resolves every route/formulation row a KB
	 * files a substance as (a candidate set is every ROW of each substance the word names, and the rows of
	 * one substance publish the same aliases), and each row that carried a rule about the same order
	 * raised its own chip. Measured live on the 3.7.1 standalone — Sarah Taylor, one diclofenac order,
	 * "Is it safe to give hydrocortisone?" — as
	 * {@code Hydrocortisone interacts with active order diclofenac} AND
	 * {@code Hydrocortisone (ophthalmic) interacts with active order diclofenac}, each carrying its own
	 * row's mechanism prose. So it was not a duplicate to drop but a choice to make, and both halves of
	 * the choice are decided elsewhere and deliberately: which rule row survives by
	 * {@link #outranks}, and what the chip calls the subject by {@link #interactionSubject}. The caller
	 * groups the rows ({@link #resolvedSubstanceRows}) and hands them here at the group's first row, so
	 * a substance's chips keep the position they have always had.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It reports how many pairs it related, and that is what reaches the wire</b> (issue #356).
	 * "Can I give this patient X?" usually resolves ONE drug, so neither pairwise arm runs — the
	 * question-pair arm needs two and the screen needs none — and this arm is then the whole of the
	 * interaction check on the canonical prescribing question. Where the name resolves to several
	 * reference entries the question-pair arm owns the field instead and this count is discarded —
	 * unless a cede left that arm with no pair of its own, where it states nothing and this count is
	 * what reaches the wire (issue #336, ADR Decision 69). The SCREENING arm's silence is not that
	 * case, and the difference is worth knowing here: this count is gated on the QUESTION's own
	 * substances, of which a screening question has none, so where that arm states nothing no count
	 * reaches the wire at all (issue #370, ADR Decision 71). For what the question-pair arm owning the
	 * field costs a reader, {@link PairChipExtent} is canonical. Stating nothing published a completed negative screen as
	 * {@code interactionPairs: null}, which {@link PairChipExtent} defines as "the producer stated no
	 * measurement": a clinician was given an abstention indistinguishable from one where nobody
	 * looked. The count returned is the RULE chips this call appended, because that is the population
	 * both pairwise arms count; the class-only sentences below are chips and are deliberately not
	 * among them. {@code validate} decides from it, and only for the substances the QUESTION put in
	 * play — see the fallback beside the two pairwise arms.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The defect.</b> A co-medication that is BOTH an explicit interaction partner AND
	 * class-related raised TWO {@code TYPE_INTERACTION} chips for one clinical fact, because neither
	 * arm could see the other. Measured live on the 3.7.1 standalone against {@code main} at
	 * {@code 89d14ab}, twice: a patient on one Ondansetron order (the concept is one of the few in that
	 * dictionary carrying a {@code WHOATC} map, {@code A04AA01}) asked "Is it safe to give dolasetron?"
	 * ({@code A04AA04}) got both
	 * <pre>
	 * Dolasetron interacts with active order ondansetron — Major. Dolasetron can cause dose-related
	 *     prolongation of the QT interval via its pharmacologically active metabolite, hydrodolasetron. …
	 * Dolasetron is in the same ATC class (A04AA) as active order Ondansetron — possible duplicate therapy
	 * </pre>
	 * Since issue #110 every chip is also injected as a citable safety-finding record
	 * ({@code DrugReferenceInjector.preAnswerFindings}), so the duplicate reached the prompt as well.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Fold, rather than "the class arm yields to the rule arm".</b> Preferring the rule chip and
	 * dropping the class chip is the wrong dedup, because a rule can reach a chip carrying nothing
	 * while the class chip ("same ATC class … possible duplicate therapy") is the informative one.
	 * Issue #88 argued that from DDInter's 42,415 Unknown-severity rows, and re-measuring the loaded
	 * 19 MB KB (295,184 rows) shows that argument no longer describes any RATED row that can chip:
	 * all 42,415 rows whose mechanism carries no text are rated Unknown, which #108's severity floor
	 * filters out before this arm sees them (3 above-floor rows do carry an empty mechanism —
	 * vilanterol, mometasone and bitolterol against regular human insulin, all Moderate — and none of
	 * the three is a class-related pair). Put the other way round: of the 2,195 above-floor rows whose
	 * pair ALSO trips the class arm — 2,181 by a shared ATC-4 subgroup, 14 by the curated NSAID group —
	 * not one carries a contentless note, so on this dataset the case #88 argued from never arises where
	 * a fold could act on it.
	 *
	 * <p>The shape that DOES survive the severity floor is the UNRATED rule:
	 * {@link #clearsSeverityFloor} deliberately exempts a rule with no severity rather than treating
	 * it as low, so every hand-authored curated rule reaches a chip whatever it carries, and one
	 * authored with no note produces a chip reading only "X interacts with active order Y". No bundled
	 * dataset holds such a rule (all five curated seed rules carry notes) but any deployment editing
	 * {@code drug-reference.json} can author one, and the fixture behind
	 * {@code DuplicateInteractionChipTest} pins exactly that row. Folding is correct for both
	 * populations without depending on which is the larger, which is why it is preferred over a
	 * measurement that #108 has already moved once.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Which rows the row counts above are over</b> (issue #263). INTERACTION ROWS: the records
	 * of the loaded KB's own {@code interactions} table, 295,184 of them on the shipped KB, each
	 * rating one unordered pair of entry ids. That is a population of its own, and neither of the two
	 * pair bases {@link #sharedClass} defines — 295,183 of these rows do pair two DIFFERENT entries,
	 * but one pairs an entry with ITSELF ({@code DDInter225}, the case
	 * {@code ddi-self-interaction.json} is built on), which no ROW PAIR can do. They do not convert to
	 * SUBSTANCE-pair figures by any arithmetic available here, because several rows can rate one
	 * substance pair; that conversion is a re-measurement, and issue #263 deliberately did not run one.
	 *
	 * <p>The fold leads with the RULE sentence: an explicit rule about this pair is the more specific
	 * finding and its mechanism note is the actionable half. It used to name the partner by the label
	 * {@link #bestRulePerPartner} groups on, and since issue #292 a chip names it by
	 * {@link #reconciledPartnerName} instead — where the class arm names it by whatever
	 * {@link #orderPartners} resolves the order's codes to, which since issue #155 is the dataset's
	 * name for the substance, else the order's own display name, and only then the bare code. Those two
	 * ladders used to disagree inside one detail, and since issue #292 they do not: the fold names the
	 * order ONCE, by {@link #reconciledPartnerName}, which is where the two cases that still keep both
	 * names are recorded. Since issue #339 an UNFOLDED chip asks that same method, so two chips of one
	 * response no longer disagree either. The class relationship follows as
	 * its own sentence, worded exactly as its standalone chip words it — see
	 * {@link #classRelationships}, where the two shortenings that seem obvious are recorded along with
	 * the issue #108 assertions each of them broke.
	 *
	 * <p><b>How the arms are correlated.</b> By SUBSTANCE identity, since that is what the two arms
	 * disagree about: the class arm's partner is an active-order ATC code, the rule arm's is a match
	 * token. Two exact tests, no heuristics — see {@link #ruleAbout}. Correlating on the order's ATC
	 * code alone (the key issue #88 proposed) is not enough, because a substance is filed under
	 * several ATC codes while a rule carries only ONE of them: {@code ddinter} writes the partner's
	 * FIRST code, so every rule naming aspirin in the loaded KB carries {@code A01AD05} while an
	 * aspirin order in this dictionary maps to {@code N02BA01}, and on that key the pair never
	 * correlates at all.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The residue this cannot correlate</b>, stated rather than papered over: when the loaded
	 * dataset carries no entry for the active order's ATC code, the rule's own code is the only evidence
	 * left that the two arms are discussing one drug — and a substance is filed under several codes, so
	 * a rule carrying one of them was compared against a class hit found under another and the pair
	 * stayed uncorrelated. That is the bundled curated seed's ibuprofen-versus-aspirin shape: the seed
	 * carries no aspirin entry, its rule cites {@code B01AC06} and an aspirin order's class hit is under
	 * {@code N02BA01}, so both chips were emitted for one pair. Since issue #155 the codes of one ORDER
	 * are one partner ({@link #orderPartners}) and {@link #ruleAbout} is asked about all of them at
	 * once, which correlates that shape and folds it — the narrowing the per-order codes of issue #132
	 * made available, taken. What is left is a context carrying only the flattened union (issue #118's
	 * fallback), where nothing says which order contributed which code: there each code is its own
	 * partner again and the two chips stand. {@code ClassChipPartnerLabelTest} pins both halves.
	 *
	 * @return the rule chips this call appended: one per partner {@link #bestRulePerPartner} kept,
	 *         after {@code statedChips} has dropped any that restate one this pass already made, and
	 *         never the class-only sentences. Read as "how many of the patient's own medications this
	 *         related the substance to" it is an over-count in the same places those chips are, and
	 *         the flattened context of the paragraph above is only one of them: the grouping key is
	 *         the partner ENTRY, so a combination prescription whose constituents both carry a rule is
	 *         two partners on an ordinary per-order chart too, and the ledger collapses them only where
	 *         they render byte for byte alike. It counts what a reader was shown, which is the residue
	 *         those chips carry.

	/**
	 * Orders this arm's rule chips strongest first, on the FINDING and not on its rating.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why the finding.</b> This is the only interaction arm that FOLDS, and a folded chip's
	 * rating deliberately understates it: {@link SafetyWarning#getSeverity()} keeps reporting the
	 * RULE's rating while {@link SafetyWarning#carriesUnratedRelationship()} carries the class arm's
	 * unrated relationship across, so a Minor rule folded with a class join answers
	 * {@link #licensesWithholding(SafetyWarning)} and states {@code STRENGTH_WITHHOLD} in the record
	 * the model reads. Ordered on {@link SafetyWarning#getSeverity()} alone that chip would sit below
	 * every caution it outranks, in the one list whose order decides what a truncated answer keeps —
	 * which is the ordering error {@code README.md} tells CLIENTS not to make with the published severity, and it
	 * would be worse made here, where the answer's own strength is what the order is protecting.
	 * {@link #licensesWithholding(SafetyWarning)} is the one definition of that split precisely so the
	 * answer's strength and the chip's ordering cannot disagree.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Then {@link #severityPriority} within each of the two, which is where unrated sits above
	 * Major</b> — the same ordering {@link #PAIR_SEVERITY_DESCENDING} and
	 * {@link #SCREENED_PAIR_SEVERITY_DESCENDING} give the two pairwise arms. That is the whole of what
	 * the three share: those two rank on it alone, because neither can fold, so this arm agrees with
	 * them on every chip whose strength its rating already states and departs from them on exactly the
	 * chips where it does not. A folded Minor therefore sorts below every rated
	 * withholding finding above it and still ahead of every caution — it withholds, so it may not fall
	 * below one. It is not necessarily the LAST withholding finding: a folded {@code Unknown} row
	 * withholds on the same OR and ranks below {@code minor}, which an operator reaches by lowering
	 * {@code minInteractionSeverity} to {@code unknown}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>That shape is also the only one over which the ORDER of the two keys is observable</b>, so
	 * it is what pins this comparator's central claim rather than an ornament of it. Read off the ranks:
	 * a withholding finding that was not folded rates {@code moderate}, {@code major} or unrated, each
	 * of which already sits at or above every caution, and a folded {@code Minor} ties a plain
	 * {@code Minor} — so in every arrangement but one, asking the rating first and asking the finding
	 * first agree. The exception is a folded {@code Unknown} against a plain {@code Minor}: it
	 * withholds and the Minor does not, while the rating ranks it lower.
	 * {@code DrugInPlayFindingStrengthKeyOrderContextTest} is the guard — swap the two keys here and
	 * read its failure.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it deliberately does not order</b>: the unrated class-only chips appended after these.
	 * They state a relationship the reference data does not rate at all, so by this method's own key —
	 * where unrated leads — they would come to head the whole list; they stay where they have always
	 * been so that the sentences the class arm produces alone do not overtake the rated findings a
	 * clinician asked about. That is a stated limit of issue #346's fix rather than a property of it.
	 * <b>Not every unrated finding, which is the misreading to guard against</b>: a RULE the source
	 * rates nothing for — a hand-authored {@code json} or curated rule — is one of this arm's own rule
	 * chips, so it is ordered here, and by the paragraph above it leads the withholding side ahead of
	 * every {@code major}. Only the class-only chips are exempt.

	 *
	 * <p><b>Issue #175.</b> The subject of an interaction chip is a SUBSTANCE (issue #162), but the rows
	 * this arm saw were only the ones the question and answer TEXT resolved — an accident of which alias
	 * the clinician or the model happened to use. Where the patient's own order name resolves MORE rows
	 * of that substance, the arm chose its rule from a strictly smaller candidate set than the screening
	 * arm ({@link #addActiveOrderPairInteractions}) would have, and since issue #173 the screen stands
	 * down from any pair this arm reported — so the milder rule survived and the more severe one was
	 * never reported. Over-report to under-report is the one direction this cluster's other fixes did not
	 * take, and it is the failure mode the whole feature exists to prevent (issue #86).
	 *
	 * <p>Reachable on shipped data, not only in principle. Measured 2026-08-09 over the standalone's
	 * 19 MB KB by calling {@link DrugReference#matchesText} and {@link DrugReference#matchesDrugName}
	 * through the built jar: of its 129 multi-row substances, 16 carry an alias that resolves a strict
	 * SUBSET of the family which an order name then widens, and in one of them the subset's best rule is
	 * strictly less severe — {@code Insulin human} against {@code fluticasone} and against
	 * {@code mometasone}, Minor deferred over Moderate. {@code OneSubstanceOneRuleTest} pins that very
	 * slice.
	 *
	 * <p>A substance ONLY the orders resolved gets a group of its own too, since issue #206 — the
	 * order-driven contraindication arm ({@link #addActiveOrderContraindications}) subjects chips on
	 * exactly those, and it has to call them what every other arm would. That does not put them in play:
	 * the interaction and dose arms are drained by the caller as it walks {@code inPlay}, so a key no
	 * in-play row reaches is never handed to them, and an order the question says nothing about still
	 * raises no interaction chip here (it is the screening arm's business). What the #175 widening does
	 * change is that a partner whose rule sits only on an order-resolved row now reaches a chip from
	 * this arm too — the same chip the screen raises for the same pair, which is the point: the two arms
	 * must not choose from different row sets.
	 *
	 * <p>Rows from the candidate set come FIRST and order rows after, so a full tie on
	 * {@link #outranks} keeps a row the text actually named. A row the ANSWER

	 *
	 *         <p><b>Issue #162, the second half</b>, and the half that is a correctness fix rather than a

	 *         about "hydrocortisone" reported {@code Hydrocortisone (ophthalmic) interacts with active
	 *         order diclofenac} — asserting an ophthalmic preparation the clinician never named and the
	 *         chart does not record.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Issue #194.</b> {@link DrugReference#canonicalRow} answers "which row names this
	 *         substance", and where the rows of a family TIE on its rungs it can only keep the earliest —
	 *         so a patient ordered one presentation was told about another. Live-measured on the 3.7.1
	 *         standalone: a {@code Botulinum toxin type A} order (the demo dictionary's concept 4259,
	 *         whose name the order carries verbatim) was subjected on
	 *         {@code Daxibotulinumtoxina (botulinum toxin type a)}, because both rows of that substance
	 *         name no route and the {@code Daxibotulinumtoxina} row is the dataset's first.
	 *
	 *         <p>That example no longer ties: issue #250 gave the fold a second rung — the row the data
	 *         files the family under, which here is {@code Botulinum toxin type A} — so the fold now
	 *         reaches this case's answer unaided, and the family it was demonstrated on can no longer
	 *         demonstrate it. The chart-anchoring step below is unchanged and still decides every family
	 *         whose rows tie on BOTH rungs; where it is pinned moved with the
	 *         example, to the COVID pair in {@code OrderedSubjectRowTest
	 *         .theOrderNamedRowIsNamedWhereTheFoldCannotReachIt}, whose two rows tie on both.
	 *
	 *         <p>So the chart decides first, and only then the fold. That order is the constraint issue
	 *         #187 settled and #192 re-measured — naming the row the CHART records is what makes a
	 *         finding truthful, and applying {@code canonicalRow} to a recorded name instead renames a
	 *         charted {@code Ketorolac (ophthalmic)} allergy. The ranking is
	 *         {@link DrugReference#nameMatchStrength}, the one #192 introduced for the allergen side,
	 *         rather than a second definition of "how strongly does this row claim that name".
	 *
	 *         <p>What it does NOT do is manufacture a preference where the record supports none. An
	 *         order contributes up to three names ({@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder}): its drug
	 *         row's name, which commonly carries a strength ({@code Aspirin 81mg}), the free text a
	 *         clinician typed for a non-coded order (issue #293, which commonly carries a strength
	 *         too), and its CONCEPT's own name, which commonly does not
	 *         ({@code Botulinum toxin type A}). Which of the three an order contributes is not a
	 *         coded/non-coded dichotomy: {@code DrugOrder.isNonCodedDrug()} is only
	 *         {@code isNotBlank(drugNonCoded)}, so an order carrying a coded {@code Drug} AND free text
	 *         contributes all three, and that row is savable wherever {@code drugOrder.requireDrug} is
	 *         false, which is the default. So a row whose display name IS that concept name reaches
	 *         {@link DrugReference#NAME_IS_THE_DISPLAY_NAME} and wins, which is what moves the COVID pair
	 *         in {@code OrderedSubjectRowTest.theOrderNamedRowIsNamedWhereTheFoldCannotReachIt}. This
	 *         sentence used to name the botulinum case here, and that is the one family issue #250's
	 *         second rung leaves unable to demonstrate it — see the paragraph above. Where no recorded
	 *         name is any row's name or alias every row scores
	 *         {@link DrugReference#NAME_TOKEN_INSIDE_A_NAME} and the fold decides exactly as before. That
	 *         second shape is what the route-variant and no-unqualified-row cases in
	 *         {@code InteractionRouteVariantTest} and {@code ScreeningSubjectLabelTest} supply — their
	 *         contexts carry the dosed form alone — which is why they are unchanged, and it is also the
	 *         residue: a deployment whose order names all carry strengths gains nothing here.
	 *
	 *         <p>Kept as a named method over the shared fold rather than inlined at its call sites,
	 *         because "what a chip calls its subject" is the decision issue #162 made, #174 site 3
	 *         extended to the screening arm, #194 anchored on the chart, #206 gave one answer per
	 *         substance per validate pass and #238 made that answer invariant to the ANSWER within each
	 *         pass — never one shared answer across the request (the qualifier is load-bearing; see
	 *         {@link SubstanceSubjects}) — the name is where that decision
	 *         is DEFINED. Where a chip arm looks
	 *         it UP is {@link SubstanceSubjects}, and a new chip-subject site belongs there rather than
	 *         here: calling this directly is how an arm ends up folding a narrower row group than its
	 *         siblings, which is exactly what #206 was — and what #236 removed from the last two arms.
	 *         Since then {@code ChipSubjectOneResolutionTest} enforces it, by scanning this file's source
	 *         for a caller outside the three permitted bodies; before that the rule was javadoc only. That
	 *         scan is about CALLERS of this method, so it is paired there with a second needle for the
	 *         bypass that calls it not at all — re-constructing {@link SubstanceSubjects} over an arm's own
	 *         group, which is the deleted {@code canonicalSubjects} wearing this class's name.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>And since issue #228 the class arm's PARTNER too</b>, on the one rung where that
	 *         partner has a recorded name: {@link #addPartnersForUnmappedOrders} resolves a
	 *         dictionary-unmapped order by NAME, so the rows it must choose among are a group and the
	 *         patient's own order is the record. The question is the same one — which row of this
	 *         substance does the chart claim — so it is answered here rather than a second time. The
	 *         class arm's OTHER partner rung is unchanged and still {@link DrugReference#canonicalRow}
	 *         alone ({@link #entryForAtcCode}, issue #174 site 1), because a bare ATC code carries no
	 *         recorded name to rank by; the two rungs cannot disagree within one response, since a
	 *         substance is one partner and the first rung to reach it names it.
	 *
	 * @param recordedNames the names the patient's own active orders carry
	 *        ({@link PatientClinicalContext#getActiveDrugNames()}), or — at the partner site above —

	 *         {@link DrugReference#canonicalRow}, which is a fold over the dataset and cannot see the
	 *         chart. Every chip names its subject through this method, which anchors on the chart first.
	 *         So wherever the patient's own record names a non-canonical row, the record and the chips
	 *         beside it called one substance two things — measured 2026-08-14 over the shipped 19 MB KB
	 *         through the real {@code injectRecords} and the real {@code validate}: 104 of the 129
	 *         multi-row substances, every one that could be posed with both surfaces.
	 *
	 *         <p>The injector reads this to decide whether it has something to SAY, not to choose the row
	 *         it renders — see {@code DrugReferenceInjector.rowAttribution} for why the row itself does
	 *         not move. That is what keeps this a widening of readers rather than a new chip-subject
	 *         site: the rule in {@link #interactionSubject}'s own javadoc — that a chip arm looks its
	 *         subject up through {@link SubstanceSubjects} rather than calling this directly — binds arms
	 *         that RAISE chips inside one {@code validate} pass, and the injector raises none.
	 *
	 *         <p>It asks over the union of {@code findImpliedByQuery}'s rows and every row the patient's
	 *         orders resolve — deliberately NOT the narrower set it decides to INJECT, which is that
	 *         union filtered by the {@code injectFromQuery}/{@code injectFromOrders} toggles and by the
	 *         relevance gate. Those decide what reaches the prompt; what a substance is CALLED may not
	 *         depend on them, and building the group from the injected rows was measured to lose the
	 *         charted row exactly when the clause is needed.
	 *
	 *         <p>One thing that union does not guarantee, stated rather than assumed. A question word
	 *         does not always resolve every row of the substance it names — the rows of one substance
	 *         USUALLY publish the same aliases, and {@code drug-reference-charted-substance-row.json} is
	 *         a fixture where they deliberately do not — so a substance reached by the question alone can
	 *         still be grouped short, the group is narrower, the fold decides, and the injector's caller
	 *         stays silent rather than guessing — see {@code DrugReferenceInjector.chartAnchoredSubject}.
	 *         (This used to name a second thing the union does not guarantee: that the injector cannot see
	 *         the rows the ANSWER puts in play. Since issue #238 the chip layer does not fold them either,
	 *         so that is no longer a difference between the two — the INPUTS now coincide. Their GROUPING
	 *         still does not, {@code DrugReferenceInjector.collect} keying on {@code substanceKey()}
	 *         falling back to the row's own id where this keys on {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey},

	 * arm ({@link #addInteractionWarnings}) already reported. <b>Since issue #370 it decides more than
	 * which chips are raised</b>: a total stand-down is why that arm makes no statement about how
	 * bounded its list was, so a change to what this ledger recognises moves the {@code
	 * interactionPairs} key as well as the chip list. ADR Decision 71. The interaction counterpart of
	 * {@link ContraindicationChips}, and keyed the same way: on IDENTITY, never on rendered text.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why not the chip's text</b> — and this is about recognising a repeat of the same PAIR, not
	 * about {@link StatedInteractionChips}, which keys on text for the opposite question (two different
	 * pairs that render alike) and runs beside this rather than instead of it. It was the text, until
	 * this ledger: the screen seeded a set with every
	 * already-raised chip's {@code (type, drug, detail)} triple and dropped any candidate that repeated
	 * one. That recognises a repeat only while the two arms word one finding identically, and they do not:
	 * <ul>
	 *   <li>Since issue #162 the drug-in-play arm names its chip after the substance's CANONICAL row
	 *       while this arm names its own after whichever row {@link DrugReferenceService#findForActiveOrders}
	 *       returned first. For a family whose route-unspecified row is not its first row the two
	 *       therefore disagree, and one pair was chipped twice — {@code Chloroprocaine interacts with
	 *       active order lidocaine} beside {@code Chloroprocaine (ophthalmic) interacts with active order
	 *       lidocaine}, identical mechanism prose under two subject labels. Reproduced through the real
	 *       parser and the real {@code validate} by
	 *       {@code DrugSafetyInteractionScreeningTest.theScreenStandsDownFromAPairTheSubstanceArmReportedUnderItsCanonicalName};
	 *       the surviving per-row subject LABEL is issue #174's site 3, which this ledger does not fix and
	 *       no longer depends on.</li>
	 *   <li>A pair stated in the OTHER DIRECTION was never recognised at all — "B interacts with active
	 *       order A" is not the string "A interacts with active order B" — so whether the repeat was
	 *       suppressed came down to which side this arm reached the pair from, which is the order
	 *       {@link DrugReferenceService#findForActiveOrders} walks the chart's own order names in. This
	 *       ledger is unordered, so it does not. Pinned by that test's sibling,
	 *       {@code ...ReportedInTheOtherDirection}, over the same fixture with the two order names
	 *       transposed.</li>
	 *   <li>Issue #88's fold appends a class sentence to the very chip this arm would raise, so equality
	 *       alone let the pair back in under two wordings, one folded and one not. That needed a
	 *       second, prefix-matching test on top of the equality one — anchored on the folded sentence's
	 *       opening because {@code iron} and {@code iron dextran} are both real KB partner labels, so a
	 *       plain {@code startsWith} would suppress a chip about a different drug. Pair identity needs
	 *       neither test: the fold decorates a chip this same pair was recorded for.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p><b>The key.</b> {@code {subject substance, partner}}, unordered. The subject side is
	 * {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()} — the substance a row stands for, else the row itself —
	 * so the arms agree about a pair however many rows either of them saw it through, and an entry from a
	 * source publishing no substance name still keys on its own identity. The partner side is
	 * {@link SubjectRule#partnerKey()}, i.e. the very key {@link #bestRulePerPartner} groups on, mapped
	 * through the same {@code substanceGroupKey} where it is an entry; so "which partner is this rule
	 * about" is answered once for the grouping and the suppression alike.
	 *
	 * <p>Only the RULE chips are recorded. A class-only chip ({@link #classRelationships}) states a
	 * different fact in different words, and the screening arm raises no such chip, so there is nothing
	 * for it to repeat. (There used to be a second reason — the class arm could not key this ledger,
	 * having only an ATC code where this wants an entry. Issue #171 gave it
	 * {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()}, so that reason is gone and only the first is
	 * load-bearing.) The arm's own

	 * The interaction chips this pass has already STATED, in the words it stated them in — so one
	 * relationship worded one way is put in front of a clinician, and into the prompt, once.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why this is not {@link InteractionPairs} and could not be</b> (issue #339, review round
	 * 12). That ledger answers "has a chip been raised for this PAIR", on identity, and its own javadoc
	 * says why it must not key on rendered text: two arms word one finding differently, so text
	 * equality UNDER-recognises a repeat. This one is the other direction and needs no identity at all
	 * — two chips whose every KEYED field is equal state the same relationship in the same words.
	 * Keyed and published are different sets, since issue #347: {@code chartOrderBridges} reaches the wire and is
	 * deliberately NOT in this key (see {@code CLAUDE.md}), so a collapsed twin can carry different
	 * bridges. What the collapse claims is that the SENTENCE repeats, which is what a reader reads.
	 * Both ledgers run: this one cannot recognise a repeat the arms word differently, and that one
	 * cannot recognise two DIFFERENT pairs that render alike.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What makes two different pairs render alike is the reconciliation this issue widened.</b>
	 * A fixed-dose combination prescription resolves to one order-rung co-medication
	 * ({@link CoMedications#partnerNaming} via {@link OrderPartner#substances}) while
	 * {@link #bestRulePerPartner} keys a rule on the partner ENTRY, so a subject that rules on two
	 * constituents produces two chips — and since this issue both are named by the prescription's own
	 * display rather than by the two rule tokens. Where the knowledge base rates the two rules alike
	 * and files them under one class-level mechanism note, the two details are then equal byte for
	 * byte. Measured through the real {@link #validate} over the shipped knowledge base: one
	 * {@code Emtricitabine / Tenofovir disoproxil} order on {@code J05AR03} asked
	 * {@code Can I give her bedaquiline?} rendered
	 * {@code Bedaquiline interacts with active order Emtricitabine / Tenofovir disoproxil — Moderate.
	 * Coadministration of bedaquiline with other agents known to induce hepatotoxicity may potentiate
	 * the risk of liver injury.} TWICE, where the merge base rendered
	 * {@code active order tenofovir disoproxil} and {@code active order emtricitabine}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The information the collapse gives up is WHICH constituent, and it is given up on the chip
	 * alone.</b> The injected {@code drug_reference} record still lists each partner under the rule's
	 * own token ({@code DrugReferenceInjector.orderedInteractionNotes}), which is the prompt-level
	 * residue issue #339 records, so both constituents are still named to the model. What no surface
	 * states any more is that TWO rules fired; naming the constituent on the chip instead would put new
	 * clause structure into a sentence {@code DrugSafetyChipLabelTest} and issue #108 constrain and
	 * that {@code DrugReferenceInjector.renderFinding} copies verbatim into a citable
	 * {@code safety_finding}, and it would do so conditionally on what OTHER chips the response holds —
	 * ADR Decision 63 carries that trade.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The key is every field the chip's SENTENCE is made of</b>, not the detail alone: the
	 * {@code type}, {@code drug}, {@code detail} and {@code severity} it renders with, plus the two
	 * booleans deciding the clauses {@link #licensesWithholding(SafetyWarning)} and
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.renderFinding} add to the injected record.
	 *
	 * <p><b>{@link SafetyWarning#chartOrderBridges()} is deliberately left OUT of that key</b> (issue
	 * #349), and it was added here and reverted, so the omission is a decision rather than an
	 * oversight: this key decides which chips are EMITTED, so it reaches
	 * {@link PairChipExtent}'s counts from BOTH arms that consult it — the screening arm collapses
	 * where the candidate is collected, before the cap, and since issue #356 the drug-in-play arm
	 * counts the rule chips that survived this ledger — and, through {@code ChartSearchAiUtils.resourceKey}, whether two injected
	 * findings share one resource uuid. A bridge must not be able to decide which chips EXIST. That
	 * reason used to be stated as "keying on a prompt-only clause would let it decide wire content",
	 * which issue #347 falsified by publishing the bridges as each chip's {@code chartOrderBridges}
	 * key; the
	 * emission argument is the one that survives it. A collapsed chip carries the SURVIVOR's bridge,
	 * which is the same residue this
	 * javadoc already accepts one paragraph up ("what it gives up is WHICH constituent"). ADR
	 * Decision 64 carries the reasoning; do not "restore" the term.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It removes a chip and nothing else.</b> Measured over 610 arrangements built from the
	 * shipped knowledge base's own CIEL combination names, driven through the real
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.injectRecords}: every rendered {@code drug_reference} text is
	 * byte-identical with this ledger and without it (636 records, 0 differing lines), so what a
	 * collapse costs is one {@code safety_finding}. That was measured rather than argued, because
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.reconciledPartnerNoteName} finds a chip by RULE IDENTITY and a
	 * collapsed chip's rule therefore falls back to {@link #partnerLabel} — which on the ORDER rung, the
	 * rung a combination prescription reaches, is the value {@link #reconciledPartnerName} hands that
	 * note anyway. ADR Decision 63 carries what that population does and does not establish.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It does NOT record the pair</b> — {@link InteractionPairs#add} still runs for the collapsed
	 * rule, because the pair really was reported (under the surviving chip's words) and the screening
	 * arm must go on standing down from it. And it does not reach {@link SafetyWarning}'s own equality:
	 * that class deliberately declares no {@code equals}, so that nothing DOWNSTREAM can collapse two
	 * chips this module meant to keep apart ({@code InteractionRouteVariantTest}). The decision stays
	 * here, where the two arms that can create the duplicate are.
	 *
	 * <p>A per-pass local and never a field — issue #172's rule, and for {@link InteractionPairs}'
	 * sharper version of it: a ledger records what THIS pass stated, so a field would go on suppressing
	 * every chip it had ever seen. Shared by both active-order rule arms for
	 * {@link ContraindicationChips}' reason — a collapse living inside one arm cannot see the other's

	 * #115's duplicate chip returns for a hand-authored dataset, silently and with two labels a
	 * clinician cannot tell apart. That shape reaches this method: {@code ddinter} lower-cases every
	 * token it derives and takes it from the trimmed RxNorm generic whenever the partner row has one,
	 * and {@code atc} carries no rules at all, but the curated {@code json} source is plain Jackson
	 * over an operator-editable file and sanitizes neither case nor padding — nor does the ATC arm,
	 * which is why the fold is applied to the coalesced value rather than to the token alone.
	 *
	 * <p>Shared with {@link DrugReferenceInjector#orderedInteractionNotes} since issue #174, which

	 * label), so a padded curated token reached the citable record as {@code "warfarin   (Major. …)"}
	 * beside a chip reading {@code "active order warfarin"}. That method now groups its notes by

	 * the partner is CALLED as well as on which of them is which — one method rather than two
	 * coalesces, for the same reason the grouping key and the rendered label have to be one string.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Issue #292 broke that agreement for a FOLDED chip and issue #297 restored it.</b> Where

	 * ladder, and for one release {@code orderedInteractionNotes} kept this coalesce, so chip and record

	 * vocabularies at once ({@code ReconciledPartner}) and the record's half travels to

	 * co-medication, both surfaces are this label again, exactly as they always were.
	 *
	 * <p>Nothing about the GROUPING has ever changed: both surfaces still key on this label case-folded

	 * Measured through the real {@link #validate} over the shipped knowledge base, one

	 * <ol>
	 *   <li><b>The ladder found no name</b> ({@code !namesADrug}) — a bare code or the {@code [ATC …]}
	 *       stand-in is the ABSENCE of a name (issue #290) and may not displace one, so both sentences
	 *       take the rule's own TOKEN. ADR Decision 38 measured the other direction: letting the code
	 *       list win "put {@code [ATC N02BA01, N02BA99]} beside the rule arm's {@code aspirin} inside ONE
	 *       folded chip detail". Asked of the token and not of {@link #partnerLabel}, which falls back to
	 *       the ATC code: with no token either, nothing here is a name and this yields null too.</li>
	 *   <li><b>The label came from an ORDER</b> ({@link OrderPartner#namingOrder}) — reconciled only where
	 *       the RULE's own token names that very order ({@link #namesNamingOrder}), because an order is
	 *       not a substance and the name it supplied may be a different drug's. Not validated against
	 *       {@link OrderPartner#labelEntry}: {@link OrderPartner#nameByOrder} deliberately does not update
	 *       that field, so on a renamed partner it identifies one drug while the label names another, and
	 *       {@link #unambiguouslyNames} would prove a fact about the first and hand out the second. The
	 *       ORDER is what the label came from, so the order is what it is put to — by the same predicate
	 *       {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasActiveDrug} used to admit the rule, narrowed to that one
	 *       prescription. Both shapes measured through the real {@code validate} refuse on it: a partner
	 *       keyed on {@code Naproxen} but renamed after an {@code Esomeprazole} order carrying naproxen's
	 *       code (token {@code naproxen}, naming order {@code Esomeprazole 20mg}) printed an NSAID
	 *       duplicate-therapy finding under the PPI order's name with {@code naproxen} nowhere in the
	 *       detail; and one order carrying codes of two substances lets {@link #ruleAbout} pick a rule by
	 *       whichever code sorts first, so a WARFARIN rule was printed under {@code Aspirin 81mg} (token
	 *       {@code warfarin}, naming order names {@code {aspirin}}). Both are the #161/#187/#194 failure,
	 *       and the second reaches the prompt through {@code DrugReferenceInjector.renderFinding} carrying
	 *       {@code STRENGTH_WITHHOLD}. What the gate ADMITS is the ticket's second named shape, where the
	 *       order the dataset cannot name is the very drug the rule is about: token {@code aspirin} beside
	 *       an {@code Aspirin 81mg} order, one name in both sentences.
	 *       <p><b>Nothing narrows this rung further, and issue #339's review rounds 3 to 6 tried</b>:
	 *       a display that also names another of this response's chip subjects is still handed to both
	 *       sentences, because the only names left to step back to are constituents of a prescription
	 *       the dataset cannot fully name and a constituent cannot carry the class sentence. See the
	 *       paragraph above and {@link #classPartnerName}.</li>
	 *   <li><b>The rule's token does not name the ladder's entry unambiguously</b> — see
	 *       {@link #unambiguouslyNames}, which carries the measurement. Refused for the same reason: the
	 *       two arms may be about different co-medications.</li>
	 *   <li>Otherwise the ladder's label is handed to both sentences.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 *
	 * <p>So {@code partnerLabel} becomes the ladder's last-but-one rung on the paths that reconcile,
	 * rather than a second independent ladder. Both GROUPING keys ({@link SubjectRule#partnerKey},
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.onePerPartner}) keep {@link #partnerLabel} — they run before this and
	 * are unaffected by it — and a class-only chip keeps the ladder's own label, which is what it always
	 * used, {@link #classPartnerName} re-deciding only WHICH ROW of the substance that label displays
	 * (issue #339, review round 1).
	 * What is no longer true, and was until issue #339, is that "outside a folded chip nothing
	 * here applies": an unfolded rule chip asks this too, through {@link #reconciledPartnerFor}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Since issue #297 this answers in TWO vocabularies</b> ({@code ReconciledPartner}), because the
	 * injected {@code drug_reference} note has to name that same partner and may not carry
	 * {@link DrugReference#displayLabel()}. Which name the RECORD takes is decided per outcome above and
	 * moves on ONE of them: outcomes 1 and 2 hand it the rule's own token, which is what it already
	 * printed, and outcome 3 hands it {@link OrderPartner#labelEntry}'s {@code getName()} coalesced with
	 * that same token, for the reason stated at the branch itself — the ENTRY rung being the one place
	 * the fold has PROVED the dataset's name is this rule's ({@link #unambiguouslyNames}). Not the one
	 * place a dataset name exists: outcome 2's {@code labelEntry} is a real entry with a real name too,
	 * and it is unvalidated, which is the whole of why the note does not take it. The record's own
	 * vocabulary, not the chip's; the two name one SUBSTANCE rather than sharing one string.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Issue #121's invariant is SCOPED by this method, not preserved by it.</b> On the branch
	 * where the dataset identifies no partner entry the grouping key is {@code partnerLabel}
	 * case-folded, and a chip on that branch can render the ladder's name instead. The grouping itself
	 * is unaffected, running before this and on that key. Issue #292 scoped that to folded chips; issue
	 * #339 asks the same question of every rule chip, so what is left of #121's second half is "the key
	 * is what the chip says wherever this method does not answer". The witness is
	 * {@code ClassChipPartnerLabelTest.anOrderTheDatasetDoesNotCoverIsNamedByItsOwnDisplayName}: the
	 * curated seed carries no aspirin entry at all, so the key is {@code aspirin} while the chip says
	 * {@code Aspirin 81mg}.
	 *
	 * <p>What issue #339 REMOVES is the asymmetry #292 left behind: two rules about one order carrying
	 * different tokens still produce two chips (issue #136's shape), but they no longer name that order
	 * two ways because one of them folded and the other did not. Both ask this.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What is NOT closed</b>, each recorded in ADR Decision 39's trade-offs with its measurement:
	 * outcome 1 can name a substance the prescription need not contain at all and then say something
	 * false ABOUT it, since the class sentence's subject moves from the prescription to whatever the
	 * token names — pinned AS WRONG by {@code FoldedChipOnePartnerNameTest}'s
	 * {@code aNamelessOrderCarryingTwoSubstancesCodesNamesTheClassSentenceAfterTheRulesDrug}, so a
	 * change that closes it fails there rather than passing in silence; outcome 3 still refuses on a TIE — a
	 * token no substance claims as its own display name ({@code penicillin g},
	 * {@code antithrombin iii}) — and wherever {@link DrugReference#canonicalRow} hands the ladder a row
	 * that is not the token's strongest claimant, which over the shipped KB is {@code gabapentin}
	 * ({@code entryForAtcCode} resolves {@code N02BF01} to {@code Gabapentin enacarbil}, an alias claim,
	 * while the {@code Gabapentin} row claims it outright) — the instance among the chips ADR Decision 52
	 * measured, and not the extent of the shape, which is not gabapentin's alone: {@code A02BC05}
	 * resolves to {@code Omeprazole} against the token {@code esomeprazole} the same way, and there
	 * refusing is the whole point of the guard. Issue #296 closed the rest of what ADR
	 * Decision 39 recorded here; a rule carrying only an ATC code keeps naming its partner by that code;
	 * and an order the loaded dataset covers NO entry for reaches no co-medication with a
	 * {@link OrderPartner#labelEntry} and no {@link SubjectRule#partner}, so an unfolded chip about it
	 * keeps the token beside a folded chip's order display — the residue issue #339 leaves, with
	 * {@code ClassChipPartnerLabelTest.anOrderTheDatasetDoesNotCoverIsNamedByItsOwnDisplayName} as its
	 * witness.
	 *
	 * @param partner the co-medication the class arm resolved, carrying the ladder's answer
	 *        ({@link OrderPartner#label}), whether that answer is a name at all
	 *        ({@link OrderPartner#namesADrug}), the ORDER that supplied the label where one did —
	 *        non-null only where that label is a name, which since issue #298 is a property of
	 *        {@link OrderPartner} as well as of this method's statement order — two independent guards,
	 *        so do not reverse the branches below on the strength of either (issue #293 changed what the
	 *        reversal would COST, not the answer; {@link OrderPartner#namingOrder} has the re-measurement)
	 *        ({@link OrderPartner#namingOrder}, {@link OrderPartner#recordNameSource}) — and the entry it
	 *        was resolved from ({@link OrderPartner#labelEntry})
	 * @param rule the matched rule the class sentence is folding onto. Its {@link SubjectRule} wrapper is
	 *        deliberately NOT taken: the entry {@link #activeOrderEntryFor} resolved for that rule is not
	 *        consulted, because {@link #identifies} accepts a bare shared ATC code, so comparing the two
	 *        arms' resolved substances agrees spuriously on exactly the shape this refuses (see
	 *        {@link #unambiguouslyNames}). What decides is the rule's own token — against the ladder's
	 *        entry on the entry rung, and against the naming ORDER where the label came from one
	 * @return the one name both sentences take, or <b>null</b> when they must not be reconciled — each
	 *         sentence then keeps the name its own arm resolved, which is what the chip has always said.
	 *         The caller reads null as "use each arm's own name", so it must not be confused with
	 *         {@link #partnerLabel}'s own nullability: that returns null only for a rule carrying neither
	 *         token nor code, which a rule inside the matched loop cannot be.

	/**
	 * The name the CLASS arm's own sentence calls an active-order partner by — the ladder's label
	 * ({@link OrderPartner#label}), with ONE thing re-decided: WHICH ROW of the substance that label is
	 * the display of.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why this exists (issue #339, review round 1).</b> Moving a rule chip onto
	 * {@link #reconciledPartnerName} moved the ROW question with it — that method names the partner by
	 * {@code subjects.subjectOf(labelEntry)}, because the ladder elects its own row with
	 * {@link DrugReference#canonicalRow} alone ({@link #sweepForAtcCode}) while every other name slot
	 * in a response elects with {@link #interactionSubject}, and taking the ladder's answer at a chip
	 * site is issue #187. Left here, the class arm would go on electing the other way, and the
	 * two elections disagree on a multi-row substance whose CHARTED presentation is not the canonical
	 * row — so one response would name one prescription two ways again, in two visibly different
	 * strings rather than the case difference this issue started from. Measured through the real
	 * {@link #validate} over the shipped knowledge base, a chart carrying one
	 * {@code Methylprednisolone (topical)} order asked about prednisolone and warfarin:
	 * {@code Prednisolone is in the same ATC class (H02AB) as active order Methylprednisolone} beside
	 * {@code Warfarin interacts with active order Methylprednisolone (topical)}, one prescription.
	 * {@code OneOrderNameAcrossOneResponseTest.aClassOnlyChipNamesAPartnerByTheSameRowARuleChipDoes}
	 * is the pin; reading {@link OrderPartner#label} here reddens it (re-measured at issue #339's
	 * review round 11 head). <b>Nothing is claimed about what that mutation leaves green</b>, here or
	 * in ADR Decision 63: an exclusivity claim of exactly this shape stood on the neighbouring
	 * election for several rounds and was false by the time round 11 read it, because a case added
	 * mid-branch began reddening on it too. Mutate it and read the failures.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The election reaches the ENTRY rung and only it, and that is the whole of what this method
	 * does</b> — a label an ORDER supplied has no row to elect and a bare code or {@code [ATC …]} is the
	 * absence of a name (issues #155/#290, ADR Decisions 38 and 39), so both keep
	 * {@link OrderPartner#label} untouched. {@code OneOrderNameAcrossOneResponseTest}'s
	 * {@code anOrderTheDatasetCoversNoEntryForKeepsItsOwnDisplay} is the null-{@code labelEntry} case
	 * with a NAMED order behind it, and it is the only shape either conjunct can be read from
	 * separately — dropping {@code labelEntry != null} does NOT redden it, since a partner with a
	 * naming order still takes {@link OrderPartner#label} under the surviving conjunct. What that
	 * mutation reaches is the CODE-ONLY shape, where both are null: it dereferences null inside
	 * {@link SubstanceSubjects#subjectOf}, so what reddens is an NPE thrown from a chip-naming site
	 * rather than a set of cases about naming a partner — and this case is not among them (re-measured
	 * at issue #339's review round 10 head). <b>No count of those failures is published, here or in ADR
	 * Decision 63</b>: one was, and round 10 measured it wrong by 5&times;, most of the failures being
	 * in a class about answer-versus-class-code fidelity that has nothing to do with partner naming.
	 * Mutate the conjunct and read the failures; a count here would only invite the next reader to
	 * treat the surplus as damage they had just done. The election itself is a no-op wherever the response grouped no rows for that
	 * substance — {@link SubstanceSubjects#subjectOf} hands back the row it was given — so a
	 * single-row substance renders exactly the string it rendered before.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Where a folded chip's rule sentence could not take this row, this one still prints it.</b>
	 * {@link #reconciledPartnerName} answers null when the rule's token claims neither the elected row
	 * nor the ladder's, and the fold then words the class sentence from here while the rule sentence
	 * keeps {@link #partnerLabel} — the residue issue #292 records and issue #339 did not close, since
	 * a class-only chip has no rule token for any gate to read. What issue #339's review round 3 DID
	 * close is the case where the two rows disagree and the ladder's would have carried the
	 * displacement; see {@link #reconciledPartnerName}'s ENTRY rung.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The ENTRY rung's fallback opens a divergence of its own, which is left OPEN and is a
	 * regression against the merge base on the arrangement below</b> (issue #339, review round 4 —
	 * recorded here and in ADR Decision 63 rather than closed). Where the rule's token claims the
	 * ladder's row but not the row this response elects, the rule chip prints the LADDER's row while a
	 * class-ONLY chip about that same prescription — raised for a different subject, which is what puts
	 * the two in one response — goes on printing the elected one. Measured at this head through the real
	 * {@link #validate} over the shipped knowledge base, one {@code Atropine (ophthalmic)} order mapped
	 * to {@code S01FA01} asked {@code Can I give her tropicamide or scopolamine?}:
	 * {@code Scopolamine interacts with active order Atropine} beside {@code Tropicamide is in the same
	 * ATC class (S01FA) as active order Atropine (ophthalmic)}. Reading {@link OrderPartner#label} here
	 * — which is what the merge base did — makes both say {@code Atropine}, also measured, so the
	 * merge base named that prescription once and this head names it twice. Nothing in the suite pins
	 * it; the condition is per RULE — the rule's token claiming one row and not the other — so no
	 * class-only chip can read it, and closing it means demoting the WHOLE partner when any rule about
	 * it refuses the elected row, which no single chip site can decide. It needs the order's display to
	 * carry the route parenthetical the knowledge base's row uses; with an ordinary display
	 * ({@code Atropine 1% eye drops}) this head is consistent and better than the merge base.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What this method deliberately does NOT do is refuse an order-supplied display</b> (issue
	 * #339, review rounds 5 to 7). Rounds 5 and 6 had it step a display this response had refused for a
	 * co-medication ({@code CoMedications.displayNamesAnotherChipSubject}, since removed) back to the
	 * rung the ladder used before {@link OrderPartner#nameByOrder} — the dataset's name for the
	 * substance {@link #soleSubstanceOf} resolved. Round 7 measured what that costs and reverted it.
	 * An ORDER-rung partner is one holding a code the loaded dataset can name no entry for, and
	 * {@link #classRelationships} cites its subgroup over ALL of the partner's codes — so where the
	 * shared subgroup came from that uncovered code, {@link OrderPartner#labelEntry} does not publish
	 * it and naming it states a class membership false of the drug named. That is the chip
	 * {@link OrderPartner#nameByOrder}'s own javadoc exists to prevent, issue #161's
	 * right-finding-wrong-reason shape, and it reaches the prompt verbatim through
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.renderFinding} as a citable {@code safety_finding}.
	 *
	 * <p>Measured through the real {@link #validate} over the shipped knowledge base. One
	 * {@code Dorzolamide / Timolol} order (codes {@code S01ED51}, uncovered, and {@code S01EC03}) asked
	 * {@code "Can I give her timolol and levobunolol?"} read {@code Levobunolol is in the same ATC
	 * class (S01ED) as active order Dorzolamide (ophthalmic)} beside a rule chip saying
	 * {@code active order timolol}: a false claim AND two disjoint names for one prescription, where
	 * both the merge base and this head say {@code Dorzolamide / Timolol} in both. One
	 * {@code Ibuprofen / Famotidine} order ({@code M01AE51}, uncovered, and {@code A02BA03}) named that
	 * one prescription FOUR ways in one response — {@code famotidine}, {@code ibuprofen},
	 * {@code Famotidine}, {@code famotidine} — two of them under an M01AE claim famotidine does not
	 * answer. Over a population of 396 synthetic arrangements, one per level-4 subgroup the shipped

	 * of this method's own sentence, and
	 * {@code .aFoldedClassSentenceAboutAPartlyCoveredOrderNamesADrugThatPublishesTheCitedSubgroup} of
	 * the fold's, that the drug named is filed under the subgroup cited — resolved through the loaded
	 * dataset rather than against a literal. Both were re-measured at issue #339's review round 11
	 * head, on the RUNGS themselves rather than on the gated refusals rounds 5 and 6 actually shipped,
	 * and the two mutations are told apart by the SECOND case rather than by counts: electing on
	 * the ORDER rung here reddens BOTH of them, while reconciling onto the rule's token at
	 * {@link #reconciledPartnerName}'s ORDER rung reddens the FOLDED one and leaves the class-ONLY one
	 * green — so the folded case is not a duplicate of its neighbour. Neither mutation is confined to
	 * that class and no count is published for either. {@code theMergedPartnerIsNotNamedAfterHalfOfACombination}
	 * beside them STATES this rule in a comment: it reddens on the first mutation and NOT on the
	 * second, because it asserts a label, and its arrangement is one where every candidate name is
	 * truthful — which is also why it survived rounds 5 and 6 themselves, whose refusals its
	 * arrangement never raises, and why round 7's own cases are stated over the class SENTENCE.
	 *

	 * the residue issue #339 accepts, asserted by
	 * {@code OneOrderNameAcrossOneResponseTest.aPrescriptionNamingTheSubjectAndThePartnerIsStillNamedOnceByItsOwnDisplay}.
	 * Rounds 5 and 6 also made a prescription's name depend on the QUESTION, since the refused set was
	 * built from the question's own drugs — the second half of what issue #339 forbids, and invisible to
	 * {@code theSamePairIsNamedTheSameWayWhicheverQuestionReachedIt}, whose arrangement raises no
	 * refusal.

	 * here. What it cost the CHIP LIST is a second thing and lives at {@link StatedInteractionChips}:

	 *
	 * <p><b>That entry and the co-medication list are two different resolutions of one chart, and

	 * changing what this declines on. {@link DrugReferenceService#findForActiveOrders} is additive (ATC
	 * ∪ NAME) while {@link #orderPartners} walks the chart's codes and resolves the rest by name, so one
	 * PRESCRIPTION can resolve to two reference substances with a partner keyed on only one of them; a

	 *         not by the superset argument that used to stand here: the flattened set contains every
	 *         name of every order, but the operand is now the order's DISPLAY, which a caller can supply
	 *         without putting it among that order's names at all.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Asked of the NAME that is about to be printed</b> — {@code order.getDisplay()}, the
	 *         very string {@link OrderPartner#nameByOrder} handed to the label and the one this method's
	 *         answer licenses into the rule sentence. Two narrowings, and they are the same argument
	 *         applied twice. It is asked of the ORDER {@link OrderPartner#namingOrder} carries, not of
	 *         every order that merged into the partner: a partner can be reached by several orders
	 *         ({@link #ordersCarrying}) and {@link OrderPartner#nameByOrder} is monotone, so the first
	 *         carrier that can name itself is both the one the label came from and the one this
	 *         validates, and asking the whole carrier set would prove a fact about one prescription and
	 *         print another's name. And it is asked of that order's DISPLAY, not of every name that
	 *         order carries, because since issue #293 one order's names need no longer be one drug's:
	 *         {@code drugNonCoded} is a name source that can disagree with the coded drug's name or with
	 *         the concept's, and either arrangement is savable on a stock install
	 *         ({@code drugOrder.requireDrug} defaults to false). Scanning them all would prove a fact
	 *         about one NAME and print another — measured before this narrowing, a coded {@code ASPIRIN}
	 *         order carrying the free text {@code Warfarin 5mg} printed the seed's UNRATED warfarin
	 *         rule as {@code Ibuprofen interacts with active order ASPIRIN}, with warfarin
	 *         nowhere in the detail, and thence into the prompt as a citable {@code safety_finding}
	 *         carrying {@code STRENGTH_WITHHOLD}.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>It is not only a narrowing, and calling it one would be false.</b> A
	 *         builder NAMES an order by the first of the names it collected, so for such an order the
	 *         display is one of its names and the old reading is a superset of the new one there — the
	 *         move refuses more and permits nothing. (Its code-only stand-in has a display that is not
	 *         among its names, and cannot reach this method at all, for the two reasons below.) Where the display is NOT among
	 *         the names it can also PERMIT more — a caller-built order with a real display
	 *         and no match tokens, which the public constructor admits and
	 *         {@link PatientClinicalContext.ActiveDrugOrder#hasKnownName()} exists to tell apart from
	 *         the code-only rung — the old reading refused because the order offered no name to put the
	 *         token to, which is an artefact of the very names-empty PROXY that flag replaces, and the
	 *         chip then carried the rule's token beside the display. The new reading puts the token to
	 *         the display, which names it, and hands one name to both sentences.
	 *         {@code FoldedChipOnePartnerNameTest.anOrderWithNoMatchTokensIsStillJudgedOnTheNameItIsAboutToPrint}
	 *         pins that leg, because the whole api suite is green under either reading of it.
	 *
	 *         <p>What the narrowing gives up is a partner whose token
	 *         names one of the order's OTHER names but not its display — a brand display over a generic
	 *         concept name — which falls back to the rule's own token and so names one order two ways
	 *         across the folded chip's two sentences, issue #136's pre-existing shape. A confusing chip
	 *         is the better failure than a false one.
	 *
	 *         <p>ONE shape has nothing to compare, and it refuses rather than counting as agreement: a
	 *         rule with no token carries no name for its partner at all ({@link #partnerLabel} falls back
	 *         to the ATC code), so nothing about the order can license one — which is why a token-less
	 *         rule keeps naming its partner by that code. Until issue #293 there were TWO, the second
	 *         being an order with no names to put the token to; that shape is now judged on its display
	 *         like any other, which is the permitting leg above. The {@code namedByCodesOnly} stand-in of
	 *         issue #290 is excluded not by having no names but for TWO independent reasons:
	 *         {@link #displayNamesADrug} answers false for it, so {@link #reconciledPartnerName}'s
	 *         {@code !namesADrug} branch returns first, and since issue #298
	 *         {@link OrderPartner#recordNameSource} also leaves its {@link OrderPartner#namingOrder}
	 *         null, so the branch that calls this would not be entered either. The second was added
	 *         without retiring the first, deliberately — ADR Decision 40.

	 *         the {@code ddinter} parser writes every entry's aliases from its name AND its
	 *         {@code rxnorm_name} ({@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}), and rows exist whose
	 *         {@code rxnorm_name} is ANOTHER substance's name. The shipped KB's row named

	 *         {@link #classRelationships} already cite for publishing only esomeprazole's
	 *         {@code A02BC05} — so {@code isNamed("esomeprazole")} is TRUE of it, and the identity test
	 *         alone would have licensed the displacement on exactly the pair this guard exists to refuse.
	 *         Measured through the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource#parse} over the pinned excerpt:
	 *         that row is {@code name=Omeprazole, rxnorm_name=esomeprazole}.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>The second half is a RANKING, not an existence test (issue #296).</b> It asks
	 *         {@link DrugReferenceService#uniqueStrongestClaimant}, the repo's one definition of "this
	 *         row claims the name and strictly outranks every rival", over every row of a DIFFERENT
	 *         substance the token names. Existence — "does the token name anything else?"
	 *         — cannot separate the two arrangements that matter, and they are opposites: the token is
	 *         the LADDER's substance's own display name and merely the rival's {@code rxnorm_name} alias,
	 *         where displacing is a spelling normalisation of one substance's name; or the token is the
	 *         RIVAL's display name and merely the ladder's alias, where displacing prints one substance's
	 *         rated mechanism under another's — the #161/#187/#194 failure, silently, in a
	 *         clinician-facing sentence and in the citable {@code safety_finding} record that carries it
	 *         verbatim. {@link DrugReference#nameMatchStrength} is what tells those apart, and the
	 *         comparison is not spelled out here for the reason its own javadoc gives.
	 *
	 *         <p>Issue #292 shipped the existence form and ADR Decision 39 recorded its cost. A tie still
	 *         refuses: two substances claiming the token equally cannot say which of them the rule is
	 *         about, which is the answer the existence form gave to every contested token.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>{@code entry}'s OWN claim, never its substance's strongest.</b> The label about to be
	 *         printed is this row's display, so a sibling presentation's stronger claim on the token says
	 *         nothing about this row. <b>Since issue #339 one rung can ask this TWICE about one
	 *         partner</b>, and that is not a relaxation of the sentence just made: the ENTRY rung offers
	 *         the row the response elects and then, if that row's own claim does not carry it, the
	 *         ladder's own row — two asks, each about the row the caller would then PRINT, and a refusal
	 *         of both is still a refusal. What is never done is carrying one row's answer to another
	 *         row's display, which is what the paragraph below rules out. The rungs also differ on which
	 *         row arrives here:
	 *         {@link #entryForAtcCode} hands over {@link DrugReference#canonicalRow}'s pick, while
	 *         {@link #addPartnersForUnmappedOrders} hands over the row the patient's own chart claims
	 *         most strongly, deliberately the route-qualified one where the chart named it that way. Over
	 *         the shipped KB, {@code Atropine} claims the token {@code atropine} outright while its
	 *         {@code Atropine (ophthalmic)} presentation and the separate {@code Hyoscyamine} substance
	 *         each claim it only as an alias — so reading the substance's strongest row would let
	 *         {@code Atropine}'s claim carry a displacement onto the label
	 *         {@code Atropine (ophthalmic)}, for a rule that may be {@code Hyoscyamine}'s. Rows of
	 *         {@code entry}'s own substance are excluded from the contest instead of contesting it, or an
	 *         uncontested token would start refusing wherever a sibling row claims it at least as
	 *         strongly — which on DDInter is every token that is not some row's own display name, the
	 *         rows of a substance sharing one alias list. A case apiece, because neither can see the
	 *         other's choice: {@code FoldedChipOnePartnerNameTest.aRuleTokenTheLaddersRowOnlyTiesKeepsItsOwnToken}
	 *         reddens if the row's claim gives way to its substance's, and
	 *         {@code aSiblingRowOfTheLaddersOwnSubstanceDoesNotContestTheToken} if the exclusion goes.
	 *
	 *         <p>Not exotic, and not a shape a curated fixture can stand in for: over the shipped KB,
	 *         25 of its 2093 distinct rule tokens are named by more than one substance
	 *         ({@code esomeprazole}, {@code hydrocortisone}, {@code trastuzumab}, {@code gabapentin},
	 *         {@code ketoconazole} …). A hand-written JSON fixture gives each row one self-name and so
	 *         refuses the displacement for a reason the default dataset does not share, which is why
	 *         {@code FoldedChipOnePartnerNameTest} pins both directions in DDINTER shape, through the
	 *         real parser.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>What "substance" means here depends on the source.</b> {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()}
	 *         falls back to the ENTRY where a source publishes no substance name — the curated {@code json}
	 *         and {@code atc} adapters — so on those every other ROW is a rival, which is strictly
	 *         stricter and refuses more. Identity is the right comparison for that fallback
	 *         because every {@code labelEntry} comes from {@code getAll()}'s own cached objects and
	 *         {@link DrugReference} defines no {@code equals}.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>What the ranking does NOT decide.</b> That the token denotes the ladder's substance
	 *         is a fact about NAMES; the DDInter row a rule was authored on is a separate fact, and
	 *         {@code ddinter} derives a rule's token from the partner row's {@code rxnorm_name}, so a
	 *         rule authored on {@code Levoketoconazole} carries the token {@code ketoconazole} too. The
	 *         reconciled chip therefore prints that rule's prose under {@code Ketoconazole} — the same
	 *         substance the token already named, so nothing NEW is asserted, but the prose can name the
	 *         other row. Measured over the shipped KB: subjects carrying two above-floor rules under the
	 *         one token {@code ketoconazole} are common, and {@code Osilodrostat} is one of them. That is
	 *         {@link #partnerLabel}'s pre-existing property — before issue #339 the unfolded chip
	 *         printed that same token, and since #339 it prints this same reconciled name, so the two
	 *         chips agree either way and neither asserts more than the token did — and closing it means
	 *         choosing between two rules, which is {@link #bestRulePerPartner}'s question, not this
	 *         one.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>So a CONTESTED token can only be admitted at {@link DrugReference#NAME_IS_THE_DISPLAY_NAME},
	 *         and — measured, not derived — the reconciled label is then that token re-cased.</b>
	 *         Every rival reaching the comparison
	 *         passed {@link #namesEntry}, so the token IS one of that rival's stored aliases; those are
	 *         stored trimmed ({@link DrugReference#setAliases}) and the loader leaves none that names
	 *         nothing ({@code DrugReferenceValidity.sanitizeAliases}), so on a loaded dataset identity
	 *         implies containment and the rival ranks at least
	 *         {@link DrugReference#NAME_IS_ANOTHER_NAME}. Nothing strictly outranks
	 *         that but the top rank. It is the trim that makes this a derivation rather than a hope —
	 *         untrimmed, a padded alias answers {@link DrugReference#isNamed} true and
	 *         {@link DrugReference#NAME_NO_MATCH}, and such a rival drops out of the contest entirely.
	 *         The LABEL half is a separate fact and only measured: the top rank says the token is the
	 *         row's {@code name}, while the ladder prints {@link DrugReference#displayLabel()}, which can
	 *         append a diverging generic — the shipped {@code Hyoscyamine} row renders
	 *         {@code Hyoscyamine (atropine)}. Measured over the shipped KB: of the 18 contested pairs
	 *         this admits, 18 are at the top rank and none has a label differing from the token by
	 *         anything but case; if that goes stale the downstream bound goes with it. That is what
	 *         bounds the change downstream — the reconciled sentence names the same substance by the
	 *         same string, so the prompt's name union for that partner cannot move, and
	 *         {@link SubjectRule#partnerKey} case-folds to the label the chip now renders rather than
	 *         away from it. The UNCONTESTED path is unchanged and still admits at either rank, which is
	 *         where a label like {@code Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin)} for the token {@code aspirin}
	 *         comes from.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Since issue #297 that bound has a SECOND surface, and on it the bound is a
	 *         DERIVATION rather than the measurement above.</b> {@link #reconciledPartnerName}'s ENTRY rung
	 *         hands the injected {@code drug_reference} note {@code labelEntry.getName()} under this
	 *         very gate, so this widening moves prompt text there as well as on the chip's
	 *         {@link DrugReference#displayLabel()}. The top rank IS
	 *         {@code normalizeName(token).equals(normalizeName(name))} and both that name and
	 *         {@link #partnerLabel}'s token reach the note trimmed, so for a CONTESTED token the note's
	 *         name is that token re-cased whatever the chip's label appends. The measured half is the
	 *         chip's alone; it says nothing about this rung and does not need to.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>The name is kept although the criterion moved.</b> "Unambiguously" now means the token
	 *         has a unique strongest claimant and this is it, rather than that it names one substance —
	 *         a reading the paragraphs above state and ADR Decisions 39 and 52 both use. Renaming would
	 *         orphan every reference issue #292 left behind, in this file, in {@code CLAUDE.md} and in the
	 *         ADR, for a word that is still true under the definition given here.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>It rests on the alias list being stored TRIMMED, and that was not free.</b> The rank
	 *         floor inside {@link DrugReferenceService#uniqueStrongestClaimant} runs
	 *         {@link DrugReference#nameMatchStrength}, which gates on {@link DrugReference#matchesDrugName};
	 *         that predicate trims neither operand while {@link DrugReference#isNamed} trims both. So
	 *         before {@link DrugReference#setAliases} trimmed, a curated entry named only by a PADDED
	 *         alias passed this method's first gate and failed the floor — losing a reconciliation the
	 *         existence form had made — and the same padding on a RIVAL row dropped that row out of the
	 *         contest and licensed a displacement, which is the #161/#187/#194 failure the ranking exists
	 *         to prevent. Both measured through the real {@code JsonDrugReferenceSource} and the real
	 *         {@link #validate}, and both closed at the stored string rather than in either predicate,
	 *         for the reasons {@code setAliases} records.
	 *         {@code FoldedChipOnePartnerNameTest.aPaddedAliasNamesTheOneOrderOnce} reddens if that trim
	 *         is removed.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>No longer a sweep of {@code getAll()}, and issue #339 is why.</b> This used to walk
	 *         the dataset for the token's rival claimants on every call, kept uncached because it ran
	 *         once per FOLDED chip — the rare outcome of the class arm rather than the ordinary one.
	 *         Since #339 it runs once per rule CHIP, and the number of distinct (token, entry) pairs a
	 *         pass reconciles grows with the drugs in play, which

	/**
	 * The matched interaction rules of {@code subjects} — all the reference rows of ONE substance
	 * (issue #162), or a single row for the screening arm's overload — worth chipping: at most one per
	 * partner, in dataset order of first appearance, each paired with the row that carries it.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why grouping is needed (issue #115).</b> DDInter carries one entry per <em>route
	 * variant</em> and every variant of a drug publishes the same {@code rxnorm_name}, so the
	 * variants' rows all reach this arm carrying the same match token: one active order matches
	 * every one of them, and ungrouped that is N chips for a single pair, at N different
	 * severities. Measured on the 3.7.1 standalone: a patient on one Dexamethasone 4mg order,
	 * asked about voxelotor, raised three chips — Major + Moderate + Moderate — of which the two
	 * Moderate details were byte-identical strings, because the nasal and ophthalmic variants
	 * share a mechanism group. Across the full KB 142 {@code rxnorm_name} values are shared by
	 * more than one entry (332 entries), and 1004 question-drugs would raise 3 or more chips for
	 * some single active drug. {@link SafetyWarning} carries no {@code equals}, so nothing
	 * downstream can collapse them — and because the chips are also injected as citable
	 * safety-finding records ({@code DrugReferenceInjector.preAnswerFindings}), each duplicate
	 * became a near-identical record in the prompt as well.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What is grouped.</b> The partner DRUG when the loaded dataset identifies one — the
	 * active-order entry the rule {@link #identifies} — else the label the chip renders
	 * ({@link #partnerLabel}, case-folded). Either way rules that would produce the same
	 * "interacts with active order X" subject collapse while rules naming different partners each
	 * keep their chip — even when their notes are identical strings. Grouping is per SUBSTANCE
	 * and per arm: two different substances in play still chip separately about the same order, and this
	 * decides only WHICH RULE ROW survives for a partner, never how many arms describe that partner.
	 * The rule-plus-class double chip of issue #88 is the separate, cross-arm question, answered
	 * downstream of this method by {@link #addInteractionWarnings} — which folds the class arm's
	 * finding into the row chosen here, so the two collapses compose in one direction instead of
	 * competing.
	 *
	 * <p>Since issue #162 the candidates for one partner come from several rows, not one — the subject's
	 * whole substance — and the two rows of a substance resolve the SAME partner key: they carry the same
	 * match token (their shared {@code rxnorm_name}), and {@link #activeOrderEntryFor} elects the order
	 * entry whose claim on that token is strongest — the same answer for both rows, since the token is
	 * the same string. So no extra key work is needed on the subject side; what needed deciding is
	 * which row wins, below.
	 *
	 * <p>The label alone was the key until issue #136, and it was a sound proxy for "one partner" only
	 * while a rule could reach an order by ONE spelling. The reference-name arm of
	 * {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasActiveDrug} matches every name the dataset gives a drug the
	 * patient is on, so two rules whose tokens are two names of the SAME partner both match and the
	 * label key kept them apart: reproduced through the real validator, a patient on
	 * {@code Warfarin 5mg} against an entry carrying both a {@code coumadin} row and a {@code warfarin}
	 * row got two Major chips for one pair. Two DISTINCT entries still get two chips even when one order
	 * name resolves both, which is what leaves the {@code enalapril}/{@code enalaprilat} decision below
	 * intact — the key is the entry {@link #identifies} names, so it collapses two rules only when the
	 * dataset itself says they name one drug, with the same alias-collision limit {@link #pairKeyNames}
	 * records for the question side (an entry whose alias list claims another drug's name). Where the
	 * dataset carries no entry for the order's substance the label is still the key, and there #121's
	 * invariant holds for every UNFOLDED chip: the key IS what the chip says. A folded chip can name that
	 * partner by the class arm's ladder instead since issue #292 — the grouping is unaffected, since it
	 * runs before the fold and on this same key, but the rendered name and the key can differ. See
	 * {@link #reconciledPartnerName}, which is where that departure and its cost are recorded.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Which row wins.</b> The most severe rating, then — since issue #162 — the row naming no
	 * route, then the longer note; longer in prose, not in whitespace, see {@link #noteLength}. The full
	 * ordering and the measurement behind the middle step live on {@link #outranks}. Route variants
	 * genuinely differ — topical dexamethasone does
	 * not have systemic dexamethasone's interaction profile, which is why DDInter rates voxelotor Major
	 * against systemic dexamethasone, Moderate against two others and carries no row at all against the
	 * topical variant — but this layer still cannot resolve which variant the order is, and since issue
	 * #234 that is a DATA-side limit rather than a context-side one. The context does now carry what the
	 * chart records about where each order is applied
	 * ({@link PatientClinicalContext.ActiveDrugOrder#getAdministrationTerms()}), and it is deliberately
	 * not read here: a rule ROW is what has to be selected, DDInter files each route variant as its own
	 * row, and all four of them publish an identical ATC list — so nothing relates a recorded route to a
	 * row. That is the data-side half of #115, and it is what issue #234 could not close;
	 * {@link DrugReference#codesForRecordedAdministration} narrows CODES for exactly that reason.
	 * Reporting the strongest rating over-warns rather than
	 * under-warns on a non-blocking advisory the clinician adjudicates, which is the fail-safe
	 * direction; the accepted cost is that a patient on a topical form may see the systemic
	 * severity. The note length is the only informativeness signal a
	 * row carries: DDInter's "no mechanism description on file" fallback is shorter than any real
	 * mechanism paragraph, and where two equally-rated rows both carry prose the longer one has been
	 * a strict superset in the shapes measured — in the two dolutegravir x iron rows (171 and 236
	 * characters of note) the surplus is the sentence "The mechanism of interaction has not been
	 * established.", so the fuller row says everything the shorter one does and states its own limit
	 * — so a tie on severity keeps the fuller note. Equal on all THREE keys — severity, then the route
	 * step issue #162 inserted between them, then the note — keeps the incumbent, so a group's chip is
	 * the dataset's first row among those the earlier keys could not separate.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Two corners this rule accepts.</b> A row with no note at all still wins its group on
	 * severity alone, so an operator's token-only unrated rule beats a rated row carrying a mechanism
	 * paragraph and the chip then gives no reason — reachable only in hand-authored data, since every
	 * DDInter row has a note, and left as it is because the alternative (a note outranking a rating)
	 * would drop the operator's own rule, which is the thing {@link #severityPriority} exists to
	 * protect. And two tokens naming two DIFFERENT entries stay two RULES here even when one order name
	 * matches both — two chips too, unless the two render the same sentence once their partner is
	 * named, which is {@link StatedInteractionChips}' question and not this grouping's: across the full KB exactly one such pair exists — {@code enalapril} and
	 * {@code enalaprilat}, which 376 entries carry as separate partners, and which a single order
	 * named "Enalaprilat 1.25 mg" matches through the order-name matcher's inflection tolerance.
	 * Prodrug and active metabolite are genuinely different DDInter entries, so that pair is reported
	 * rather than merged.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Which pairs that 1 counts</b> (issue #263). Pairs of dataset ENTRIES both matched by ONE
	 * order name: a population of its own, and neither of the subgroup-sharing populations
	 * {@link #sharedClass} counts, which relate two entries by ATC and not by a name. The two BASES
	 * {@link #sharedClass}'s javadoc defines do apply to it, and the answer is 1 on both. Measured
	 * 2026-08-29 over the shipped KB through {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource.load},
	 * {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()} and {@link DrugReference#canonicalRow}:
	 * {@code Enalapril} and {@code Enalaprilat} are one row each and fall into two substance families,
	 * so the one ROW pair is also one SUBSTANCE pair. The 1 itself is the pre-existing figure and was
	 * not re-derived.

	 *         anti-inflammatory drugs and ophthalmic steroids …" for a systemic order). The note length
	 *         cannot be what decides that, and the shipped KB carries hundreds of (substance, partner)

	 *         carries a 495-character note against plain {@code Ketorolac}'s 265, so
	 *         severity-then-longest-note alone hands that chip the eye-drop prose. Pinned by
	 *         {@code InteractionRouteVariantTest.theSurvivingChipIsNotDecidedByWhichNoteIsLonger} over
	 *         those very rows, rather than by an exact count of the pairs sharing the shape — two
	 *         independent measurements over the KB disagreed about that count while agreeing about these
	 *         rows and about the order of magnitude, so the rows are what this records.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>The predicate it reads was corrected by issue #250, and this is the second site of
	 *         that defect rather than a bystander.</b> {@link DrugReference#namesNoRoute()} used to read

	 *         {@link #bestRulePerPartner} over every multi-row family of the shipped KB, and through the
	 *         question-PAIR arm's own entry-pair walk: <b>222 of 40,619</b> drug-in-play groups and
	 *         <b>97 of 951</b> question-pair groups change which row wins, and exactly <b>1</b> changes
	 *         the rendered note text — the influenza A/Vietnam family against
	 *         {@code ozanimod}, where the fuller of the two notes now survives. <b>0 of the 319 change
	 *         severity</b>, and that figure is ENTAILED rather than independently observed: this method
	 *         compares {@link #severityPriority} first and returns wherever the two differ, so the route
	 *         step is reached only at equal severity and a group's winner is maximal in severity whatever

	 *         PRESENTATION row ({@code (6m-5y)}, {@code (6m-5y bivalent booster)}, {@code (6y-11y)},
	 *         {@code (booster only)}) to the row the data names the tick-borne substance after, at
	 *         identical severity and byte-identical prose — the direction this step exists to move in,
	 *         with both drugs still named in the sentence because both were named in the question.
	 *         {@code SubstanceNameRowTest.aQuestionPairSentenceIsOwnedByTheSubstanceRowAndNotByAPresentationOfTheRival}

	 * withholding it because the patient happens not to be on either drug answers a question nobody
	 * asked.
	 *
	 * <p>Deliberately scoped to the QUESTION's drugs, not to all of {@code inPlay}. The

	 * <p>The floor is the shared {@code severityFloor} the chart arm is given, so this cannot become a

	 * to {@link #addInteractionWarnings}, whose chip states a fact about THIS patient — the stronger
	 * statement, and reporting both would say one finding in two voices. Stated precisely, because the
	 * looser version ("either drug is an active order") is not what the code can ask and not what it
	 * does: the test is whether any ABOVE-FLOOR rule joining the pair names an active order,
	 * {@link #coveredByActiveOrderArm} putting the same question to {@code hasActiveDrug} that
	 * {@code addInteractionWarnings} answers when it decides to chip. The two differ, and the difference
	 * is deliberate — a patient can be ON one of the pair while no rule joining it names their order
	 * (the one-directional case below), and that pair is this arm's to report, because the chart arm
	 * raises nothing for it.
	 *
	 * <p>{@link DrugReferenceInjector#orderedInteractionNotes} is deliberately NOT extended to match.
	 * Its "a partner that raises a chip is exactly a partner promoted here" does not hold across the

	 * itself, scoped to the drug-in-play arm, which is the rewording this paragraph used to defer to
	 * whichever PR owned that method next (issue #174 site 2 was it). What is NOT affected is the
	 * invariant the sentence exists to protect, that a chip and the prose cannot describe the same
	 * finding differently: since issue #110 the deterministic finding is itself injected as a
	 * numbered, citable record by {@code preAnswerFindings}, carrying this chip's string verbatim and
	 * the strength clause after it ({@link DrugReferenceInjector#renderFinding}, issue #283 — a
	 * question-pair finding is an INTERACTION, so it states one like every other), so a pair
	 * finding's grounding comes from that record rather than from the promoted notes, and the
	 * promoted-note budget is untouched. <b>Verbatim across passes too, not only within one</b>:
	 * {@code renderFinding} copies the chip the PRE-ANSWER pass raised, and between issue #236 and issue
	 * #238 this arm's subject was folded over a group the answer widens, so the record the model reads
	 * and the chip the clinician sees could name one substance two ways — ADR Decision 49 is canonical
	 * for that measurement. Issue #238 (ADR Decision 53) closed it: this arm's subject now comes from
	 * {@code namingGroups}, which every question drug is already in, so the answer cannot move it — see
	 * {@link SubstanceSubjects}. What the two cannot do, before or after #238, is describe one finding
	 * differently within a pass. That half is worded to match
	 * {@link DrugReferenceInjector#orderedInteractionNotes}, which this paragraph is paired with —
	 * each cites the other — because the two came apart once already, when only one of them was
	 * reworded for the clause.
	 *
	 * @param subjects the one per-{@code validate} answer to "which row does this response call this
	 *        substance by", shared with every other arm since issue #236 — never a fold over this arm's

	 * (measured: in all 142 of those families the token is an exact alias of every member).
	 *
	 * <p>The name is resolved PER DRUG, once, rather than per pair, because a drug that keys two ways
	 * gets two keys and its pair escapes the grouping. It did: the name came from the other side's rule

	 * to name it with. Resolving from ANY of the question's drugs' rules removes the second vocabulary
	 * from the common case entirely, and route variants agree by construction, being named by the one
	 * token that identifies them all.
	 *
	 * <p>De-duplicating inside a safety net can only be done where nothing actionable is lost, and two
	 * entries share a name only when the reference data itself gives them one. The surviving chip then
	 * carries that same rule's severity and mechanism, and all that is dropped is a second spelling of
	 * the partner; entries the data can tell apart keep their own chips, asserted over three drugs named
	 * in one question. Which variant's row supplies the severity is #115's open half; the dataset's
	 * first is kept — no longer the same rule as the chart arm's, which since issue #162 prefers the row
	 * naming no route before falling back to its first.
	 *
	 * <p>Two entries that end up with the SAME name are one drug, not a pair, and raise nothing. That is
	 * reachable from a question naming a single drug: the two-drugs guard counts ENTRIES, and one word
	 * resolves several when the KB carries variants of it — 33 above-floor rows in the full KB join two
	 * entries sharing one token (29 drug words: minoxidil, timolol, lidocaine, atropine, neomycin,
	 * paclitaxel …). Reporting one would assert a combination the clinician never proposed (issue #105's
	 * over-reach), and where the variants are named after different substances it would name two drugs
	 * the question never mentioned, which is #86. The measured cost of that suppression is bounded: only
	 * 6 of the full KB's 2093 distinct tokens are an exact alias of entries with different
	 * {@code rxnorm_name}s, and all 6 are one substance family (the trastuzumab conjugates, isosorbide
	 * and its mononitrate, the COVID-19 vaccines), so a pair genuinely worth reporting is not among them.
	 *
	 * <p>The name comes from {@link #partnerLabel}, the same coalesce the chart arm's own grouping keys
	 * on, so the two arms that now group chips in this class agree by construction about what naming a
	 * partner means. They cannot fight over a pair: both consult {@code hasActiveDrug}, and they take
	 * opposite branches of it. Whenever any rule joining a pair names an active order, this arm records
	 * the pair as the chart's and raises nothing, while {@link #bestRulePerPartner} raises exactly one
	 * chip for that partner label — grouping only merges chips sharing a label, so a chip for the
	 * deferred pair always survives it, at that partner's most severe row. Whenever no joining rule
	 * names an active order, the chart arm raises nothing for the pair and this arm reports it. So one
	 * clinical pair yields one chip from one arm, never two chips and never none.
	 *
	 * @return each drug mapped to the reference data's own name for it: the match token (or, for a rule
	 *         carrying only a code, the ATC code) of the first above-floor rule any OTHER drug in

	/**
	 * Which of this patient's own active orders each substance a chip NAMES was resolved from, where
	 * the name that order DISPLAYS does not name it — issue #349, the bridge the injected
	 * {@code safety_finding} states so that a finding about a brand-named prescription is citeable at
	 * all, and published as that chip's {@code chartOrderBridges} since issue #347. Empty wherever
	 * the module attributed nothing, which is NOT a claim that the chart records the substance: see
	 * {@link SafetyWarning#chartOrderBridges()} for what empty covers, and do not restate that list
	 * here, nor offer a rule about which chips are empty: every draft of one has been measured false.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why it exists.</b> A finding names its substances in the KNOWLEDGE BASE's vocabulary, which
	 * is right and is issue #339's settlement. Where the module reached a substance from an active order
	 * through its WHO ATC map alone, every chart record the model can read names that order something
	 * else, so the finding is unciteable by construction and the model resolves that by disclaiming.
	 * {@link DrugReferenceInjector#FINDING_CHART_ORDER_LEAD} carries the measurement and the wording
	 * argument; this method is only about WHICH orders may be named.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The SUBJECT against every order; the PARTNER only against the orders its own arm let
	 * witness it, which the CALLER supplies. That division is the whole of the correctness here, and
	 * getting it wrong reopened the ticket.</b> {@link #activeOrdersOtherThan} drops the subject's own
	 * orders before the partner is witnessed, precisely so one prescription cannot report the two halves
	 * of one tablet as an interacting pair — its javadoc records the measured case, one "Aspirin and
	 * omeprazole" order reporting "Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) interacts with active order
	 * esomeprazole". So {@link #addActiveOrderPairInteractions} hands {@link #ordersOtherThan}, which is
	 * that reduction under its own predicate; naming an order it refused would put the suppressed
	 * witness back into citable text carrying {@link DrugReferenceInjector#STRENGTH_WITHHOLD}.
	 * {@code InteractionFindingChartOrderBridgeTest.eachSubstanceIsAttributedOnlyToTheOrderThePassResolvedItFrom}
	 * pins that, on a combination brand carrying BOTH substances' codes.
	 *
	 * <p><b>But {@link #addInteractionWarnings} makes no such reduction, so it hands the whole list.</b>
	 * Its own comment says as much — it runs "ungated, uncapped, and without that arm's
	 * {@code activeOrdersOtherThan} reduction". The first cut of this method performed the reduction
	 * ITSELF, for both arms, and that suppressed a witness the drug-in-play arm had not suppressed:
	 * on ONE prescription carrying both codes, asked about the partner substance, the finding read
	 * "Clarithromycin interacts with active order Simvastatin" and bridged Clarithromycin alone — issue
	 * #349's own unciteable finding, inside the clause added to close it, now beside a sentence
	 * asserting that the module HAS stated its resolutions. Found in review; mutate the call site to
	 * {@code ordersOtherThan} and {@code .aCombinationOrderCarryingBOTHSubstancesBridgesBothSides}
	 * reproduces it verbatim. The lesson generalises past this method: a reduction belongs to the arm
	 * that performed it, and a shared helper that assumes one is asserting something about a caller it
	 * cannot see.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The silence test is the name a chart record of the order DISPLAYS, never the string the
	 * chip prints.</b> A printed name is USUALLY a {@link DrugReference#displayLabel()}, which is
	 * multi-word, parenthesized or synonym-suffixed for much of this knowledge base
	 * ({@code Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin)}, {@code Hydrocortisone (ophthalmic)}), and
	 * {@link DrugReference#matchesOrderName} can only answer true where the display carries the WHOLE
	 * string — so putting the printed label to the display would bridge {@code Aspirin 81mg} as if the
	 * chart named nothing. {@link #displaysANameOfAny} asks instead whether the order's own displayed
	 * name reaches the substance, through {@link #matchesDrugNameAny}, and
	 * {@code .anOrderNamingTheSubstanceOnlyByAnAliasIsNotBridged} is the case that reddens if it ever
	 * weakens back to a printed-name test.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It was every name the order RECORDS until issue #347, and the change is that method's own
	 * subject.</b> The short of it: the module records a concept name the chart's record never
	 * renders, so the old test was satisfied by a name no reader could see, and the clause fell silent
	 * on the brand-named prescription it exists for. What that leaves standing is issue #136's
	 * alias-spelling shape, unpinned as before. It also decouples this test from
	 * {@link #resolvesFrom}: until #347 it was exactly that predicate's NAME leg negated, so the
	 * clause printed only where the ATC leg — or, since issue #353, the bridged-concept leg — was what
	 * made the resolution true. It no longer is, which is what {@link #displaysANameOfAny} records.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It is not the only silence, and calling it "the" silence test is false.</b>
	 * {@link #restsOnAnAmbiguousBridge} withholds a second class of clause — an order joined to the
	 * substance by nothing but a bridged concept whose OWN recorded name does not name that substance —
	 * and the two are independent, which #347 did not change: a display test cannot reach that class
	 * either, because the premise of the bridged leg is that the order's own names do not reach the
	 * substance at all, and its display is one of those names. Note which name each of the two asks
	 * about: this one the ORDER's displayed one, that one the BRIDGE's recorded one.
	 *
	 * <p><b>"Usually", because the partner's printed name is {@link #partnerLabel} wherever nothing
	 * reconciled</b> — the rule's own token, or its bare ATC code where the rule carries no token
	 * (#121's residue). So the clause can read {@code J01FA09 from Klarizom}: a bare code in the slot
	 * this method's own reasoning reserves for a substance name, guarded on the ORDER side (#290) and
	 * not on this one. Left unguarded deliberately — where the chip itself names the partner by a code,
	 * a bridge is the only thing in the prompt connecting that code to a record, and refusing it would
	 * lose the connection entirely rather than improve it. Named here rather than left to be found.
	 *
	 * <p>An order the module could read no name for contributes nothing: {@code [ATC …]} is the ABSENCE
	 * of a name (issue #290), so handing it over would put a bare code where the record had a substance
	 * name. Asked THROUGH {@link #displayNamesADrug}, which is the one place those two conditions are
	 * written — see its own javadoc for why CLAUDE.md's "never before merely labelling" exemption does
	 * not reach this caller: nothing here is being labelled, and the refusal is the point. An earlier
	 * draft of this paragraph said the opposite and wrote the pair inline, which is the third copy
	 * issue #292 created that method to prevent.
	 *
	 * <p>Items are emitted in the context's own order and de-duplicated, so a substance the pass
	 * resolved from two orders yields one item per order. <b>The SET of items does not depend on the
	 * sequence {@code OrderService} returned the prescriptions in; their ORDER does</b> — measured, and
	 * an earlier wording here claimed the stronger thing: reversing that list reverses the rendered
	 * clause. That is a legibility property and not a safety one, which is why it is stated rather than
	 * removed; the assertion pinning the whole clause as a literal therefore depends on the fixture's
	 * own list order.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Asked once per chip, over every active order. The cost is real, bounded and measured — and
	 * a CHIP COUNT does not describe an arrangement here.</b> A screening pass calls this for every
	 * candidate pair, and {@code maxPairChips} bounds the chips and not the calls — so a chip count does
	 * not describe an arrangement here, as the three below show at one cap. Measured through the real
	 * {@code validate} over the shipped knowledge base, 40 brand-named orders, 9 interleaved runs after
	 * 3 warm-ups, three shapes drawn from that KB's own substances sorted by interaction count: 614
	 * calls (busiest 40) 96 ms live against 83 ms with this method's body stubbed to an empty list; 118
	 * calls (median 40) 42 ms against 41 ms; 0 calls (quietest 40) 14 ms against 14 ms. At 80 busiest
	 * orders, 2405 calls, 355 ms against 272 ms. A request pays the pass TWICE (pre-answer and
	 * post-answer), so the maximising arrangement is ~+26 ms per request against a request whose
	 * latency is an LLM call. Measured 2026-09-01 with a bespoke instrumented harness and a
	 * stubbed-body A/B. NO committed fixture pins any of them, so re-measure rather than re-quote.
	 * <b>Two changes have landed since, and the figures stand as an upper bound on the first and say
	 * nothing about the second.</b> Issue #347 replaced the silence test the measurement ran against
	 * ({@code recordsANameOfAny}, a fold over every name the order records) with
	 * {@link #displaysANameOfAny}, which does no MORE work per call — equal where the order records one
	 * name, less where it records more. Issue #353 added {@link #restsOnAnAmbiguousBridge}, a second
	 * walk on the orders that reach it — {@link #resolvesAsideFromTheBridgesOwnName} since #347's own
	 * review round 2, which adds one pass over that order's bridged entries to read the names it
	 * excludes — and, for those that pass it, one
	 * {@link DrugReferenceService#substancesNamedByBridge} per ORDER for the pass; none of that is
	 * included above and none of it has been measured. Both of those are bounded by the orders that
	 * reach the conjunct, which on a chart whose prescriptions the dataset can name is none of them.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Both payments have a reader since issue #347, and that sentence used to say otherwise.</b>
	 * It read "HALF of that second payment is dead work" on the grounds that
	 * {@link SafetyWarning#chartOrderBridges()}'s only production reader was
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.chartOrderClause}, reached only from {@code preAnswerFindings}. The
	 * POST-answer pass's bridges are now what {@code ChartSearchAiRestController} publishes as each
	 * chip's {@code chartOrderBridges}, so the ~13 ms per pass is spent twice and read twice. The collapse
	 * key still deliberately does not read it, for the reason that accessor gives. <b>The per-subject
	 * hoist was implemented and declined</b>, not guessed at: order-preserving, output-identical over
	 * the whole suite, and worth 2 ms at 40 orders and 27 ms at 80. Do not re-derive it; ADR Decision
	 * 64 carries the numbers.
	 *
	 * @param subjectRows every row of the subject's substance — the GROUP form, because a substance has
	 *        N rows and only some carry the code (issue #189, the same reason
	 *        {@link #activeOrdersOtherThan} takes a group)
	 * @param subjectRow the row whose {@link DrugReference#displayLabel()} the chip is about to print;
	 *        taken rather than its name, so this and {@code interactionWarning}'s own detail cannot
	 *        print two different subject names
	 * @param partnerRow the partner entry the arm already resolved, or null where the dataset carries
	 *        none for that order — then the partner side contributes nothing, which is fail-closed. It
	 *        is {@link #activeOrderEntryFor}'s ELECTION, and that ranking is what keeps this row group
	 *        and {@code partnerName} about one substance (issue #353, review round 3)
	 * @param partnerName the name the chip is about to call the partner
	 * @param orderEntries {@code findForActiveOrders}' own answer, handed down rather than re-resolved

	 *         reaches Omeprazole, while the ranked {@link DrugReferenceService#substancesNamedByBridge}
	 *         under {@link BridgedOrders#recordedNameNames} said it does not NAME it — and the
	 *         unranked reading, standing in for independent evidence, cancelled the refusal the ranked
	 *         one had earned. Before issue #347 no order got that far: the silence test was
	 *         {@code recordsANameOfAny}, over this same name set, so the shape short-circuited into
	 *         silence one step earlier.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>A recorded name that IS the bridge's own is not independent of the bridge.</b>
	 *         Both sides of the coincidence descend from the one CIEL concept name, and the ranked
	 *         reading of that string is already the second conjunct's business. So the two conjuncts
	 *         now partition the evidence: this one judges what the chart records BESIDES the bridge's
	 *         name, and {@link BridgedOrders#recordedNameNames} judges the bridge's name itself, by
	 *         the accessor CLAUDE.md designates for printing a substance's label into a sentence about
	 *         the patient's record.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Residue, named rather than claimed closed.</b> A recorded name that is NOT the
	 *         bridge's own string still answers this through the unranked matcher, so a concept whose
	 *         dictionary spelling differs from the bridge's while still containing a bounded token of
	 *         another substance's name keeps the clause. That is {@link #resolvesFrom}'s own NAME-leg
	 *         residue, which this method does not close and which no measurement here covers;
	 *         narrowing it would change what every name-resolved order states.
	 *
	 *         <p>The legs are {@link #recordsANameOf}'s excluding overload and
	 *         {@link #recordsACodeOf}, the same two primitives {@link #resolvesFrom} asks, so this is
	 *         a second FOLD over shared legs and not a second reading of either leg. The bridged leg
	 *         is absent by construction, which is what {@code BridgedOrders.NONE} used to express.
	 *
	 *         <p>Mutate the exclusion — hand {@link Collections#emptySet()} instead of the bridge's
	 *         names — and
	 *         {@code BridgedConceptOrderResolutionTest.anEnglishSessionsSpellingOfAnAmbiguousBridgeNamesNoPrescriptionEither}

	 *         {@code getNames()} beside its drug-row name — so an order displayed {@code Advil 400mg}
	 *         on concept {@code Ibuprofen} satisfied the old test through a name that reaches no
	 *         prompt text at all, and the clause stayed silent on exactly the shape where the
	 *         correspondence is missing. That is issue #347: the answer named the prescription
	 *         {@code Advil} after the record it cited while every chip named it {@code Ibuprofen}.

	 *         consequence ("a bridge for an order whose recorded name DOES name the substance") that
	 *         is now the intended behaviour rather than the hazard. The clause's TRUTH never rested on
	 *         it: {@link #resolvesFromAny} beside it is what makes the attribution true, and this
	 *         conjunct only ever decided whether saying it was worth the record's budget.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Round 2 of this issue found one exception to that, and it is not a small one.</b>
	 *         Where the OTHER recorded name is the dataset bridge's own name for the order's concept,
	 *         the clause states which of several substances the prescription is when the module cannot
	 *         — and on an {@code en} deployment that is the ordinary case, because the concept's
	 *         locale-preferred name is the string the bridge carries. The decoupling did not create
	 *         that over-wide name match; it stopped hiding it, and it also let it cancel the refusal
	 *         issue #353 had written for exactly that population.
	 *         {@link #resolvesAsideFromTheBridgesOwnName} is where the exception lives.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>It is not a pure widening, and the direction it can NARROW in is the one
	 *         {@link #recordsANameOf}'s own javadoc used to name.</b> For an order
	 *         {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder} built, the display IS one of the recorded names,
	 *         so this predicate implies the old one and the change can only ADD clauses. For a
	 *         caller-built order whose display is NOT among its names — the residue that javadoc
	 *         recorded, in the other direction — the display can name the substance while no recorded
	 *         name does, and then a clause that used to print is now silenced. Nothing in this repo
	 *         builds such an order outside a test, and the refusal is fail-closed either way: a
	 *         silenced clause states nothing, it does not state something false. Stated so the
	 *         widening is not read as monotone, which it is only over the builder's own orders.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Residue: TWO shapes where the display is not what a record renders, both on the
	 *         rungs below a drug row with a non-blank name.</b>
	 *         {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder} reads the drug row's name, then
	 *         {@code drugNonCoded}, then the concept's, and the display is the first of those it
	 *         found (issue #293); querystore takes the drug row's name where non-blank and otherwise
	 *         the concept's. So (a) an order with no drug-row name and free text written in its place
	 *         is displayed by that free text here and by the concept's preferred name there; and

	 *       #86 settles on. The guard has to cover every leg of that join, not the order-name one alone
	 *       — the ATC leg needs the co-formulation case as well, where ONE order resolves to several
	 *       entries and the order's own code would otherwise witness a pair between them, and since
	 *       issue #136 the reference-NAME leg needs the same reduction, which is the purest form of the
	 *       self-witness: the subject's own entry naming itself.</li>
	 *   <li><b>Each pair once.</b> Interaction rows are symmetric — {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}
	 *       expands each row onto BOTH drugs' entries, which is what from-either-side matching
	 *       relies on — so pairwise the same pair is reached from each side and would chip twice,
	 *       in opposite directions, saying the same thing. Collapsed on an unordered pair key. This
	 *       doubling is created here, so it is fixed here; it is neither the cross-arm rule-vs-class
	 *       duplication of issue #88 (correlated per {@code ref} by
	 *       {@link #addInteractionWarnings}, so it cannot see two different {@code ref}s) nor the
	 *       route-variant duplication of #115 (collapsed per partner label by
	 *       {@link #bestRulePerPartner}). Both are fixed now, in their own arms, and neither fix
	 *       reaches this doubling — two entries sharing one {@code rxnorm_name} are two ids and so two
	 *       keys, and one pair reached from both sides is one {@code ref} each time. Separately from this
	 *       arm's own key, nothing is reported for a pair a drug-in-play chip already covers, whichever
	 *       row either arm named the substance after — see {@link InteractionPairs}.</li>
	 *   <li><b>Blast radius.</b> Candidates grow quadratically with the medication list, so they are
	 *       ordered most-severe-first and cut at {@link #maxPairChips()}, with every withheld pair
	 *       logged.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * @param subjects the one per-{@code validate} answer to "which row does this response call this
	 *        substance by", shared with every other arm since issue #236 — see the comment at the read
	 *        below for why no chip of this arm can move and what can. Every order entry is added to that
	 *        lookup's group map by {@link #resolvedSubstanceRows}, so the ungrouped-row fallback is
	 *        unreachable from here too.
	 * @return what this screen measured, or {@code null} where it measured no list — which is a pass
	 *         that could not run at all (no clinical context) and, since issue #370, one that KEPT NO
	 *         PAIR having ceded at least one to the drug-in-play arm through
	 *         {@code alreadyReported}. Stated as the predicate the code has rather than as "ceded
	 *         every pair": this arm has a third exit the question-pair arm lacks
	 *         ({@code StatedInteractionChips}), so a pass that ceded one candidate and collapsed
	 *         another kept none without having ceded all, and states nothing for the same reason —
	 *         it has no bounded list of its own. What the response still holds for a pair this arm
	 *         excluded is stated at the branch itself, and ADR Decision 71 is canonical for it.
	 *         Narrowing this to a literal total cede leaves the whole suite green (measured),
	 *         which is why the wording is not left to imply it. The two are one statement to a
	 *         reader, and both are unlike {@code of(0, 0)}, which asserts that the reference data related none of the pairs this
	 *         screen enumerated. Unlike {@link #addQuestionPairInteractions}, whose {@code null} on the
	 *         same rule reaches {@code validate}'s issue #356 fallback, this arm has none behind it, so
	 *         the {@code null} is what a client reads — ADR Decision 71 is canonical for why it is
	 *         still the only value left, and for what it costs.

	 *         round 3</b> —
	 *         {@code BridgedOrderSelfWitnessContextTest.theBridgedOrderDoesNotWitnessAnInteractionBetweenItsOwnTwoConstituents}.
	 *         See {@link #ordersOtherThan}, which carries the measurement for both sites and for the
	 *         reference-NAME leg below.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>The whole substance, not one row (issue #189).</b> Since the screening arm's subject
	 *         is a substance rather than a row, the reduction has to be too: reduced against one row
	 *         only, a SIBLING row's order would remain in this context and could witness the subject's
	 *         own pair — the self-witness this method exists to prevent, arriving through the route
	 *         variant instead of through the order name. Every "{@code ref}" test below is therefore
	 *         asked of the group: an order is the subject's own when ANY of its rows resolves from it,
	 *         and the codes removed are the union of the group's.
	 *
	 *         <p>Both legs of that join are attributable per order (issue #132): an order carries its
	 *         own ATC codes on {@link PatientClinicalContext.ActiveDrugOrder} exactly as it carries its
	 *         own names, so dropping the subject's order drops what it contributed to BOTH legs. Before
	 *         that, codes lived only in the context-wide set and a code could not be traced to an order:
	 *         a fixed-dose combination is one order that resolves to SEVERAL entries (the order name
	 *         whole-word-matches an alias of each constituent) while its single mapped code belongs to
	 *         just one of them, so dropping only {@code ref}'s codes left the co-formulated other half's
	 *         code standing as if it were a second order. Measured on the 16-drug DDInter excerpt: one "Aspirin
	 *         and omeprazole" order reported "Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) interacts with active order
	 *         esomeprazole — Minor", i.e. the two halves of one tablet as an interacting pair, naming a
	 *         drug the patient is on in no form.
	 *
	 *         <p>A code the subject's own order carries is removed but then RE-ADDED when another order
	 *         carries it too, because removal from a flattened set cannot tell contributors apart: a
	 *         patient on both a combination and a separate order of one of its constituents keeps that
	 *         (genuine, duplicate-therapy) pair, which the pre-#132 reduction had to give up whenever
	 *         only the shared code witnessed it. Codes that no per-order set claims are left alone.
	 *         Since issue #290 the BUILDER produces no such code: an order it cannot name still reaches
	 *         the per-order list, and one with no codes contributes none to the union either, so in
	 *         production every code here has an order behind it. What remains is a HAND-BUILT context
	 *         that supplies an order list AND a wider flattened set — not the flattened-only shape of
	 *         issue #118, which never reaches this block at all (the guard below requires a non-empty
	 *         order list, and the flattened fallback further down is where that residual lives). For a
	 *         hand-built disagreement, leaving the code alone is a choice rather than a property:
	 *         nothing there establishes a second order, which is why the {@code otherCodes.retainAll}
	 *         below treats such a disagreement as untrusted.
	 *
	 *         <p>Restoration reaches every order EXCEPT one that is itself the subject's own, and that
	 *         bounds what this can find: when every order carrying one member of a pair also carries the
	 *         other's code, both members' orders are own-classified from both sides and the pair goes
	 *         unreported — two brand-named, ATC-mapped multi-substance orders covering the same two
	 *         substances (measured shape: two differently-named orders both mapped to
	 *         {@code C10AA01} + {@code J01FA09}). That is the safe direction — a pair missed, never one
	 *         invented — and it cannot be told from the one-order case without more order structure than
	 *         a code set carries, which is why the one-order suppression wins.
	 *
	 *         <p>A nameless order used to be a second such bound, its codes reaching the union while it
	 *         was itself absent from the list so nothing could restore them. Issue #290 removed it, and
	 *         the effect here runs in BOTH directions rather than only widening: such an order now
	 *         either classifies as the subject's own — its other codes joining {@code ownCodes} and
	 *         being removed, suppressing pairs that fired before — or as another order, restoring codes
	 *         that were stuck. It also gains the #136 reference-NAME leg below, which only the per-order
	 *         branch collects, so this is a new witness path and not merely a wider code set.
	 *
	 *         <p>The flattened fallback below cannot do any of this, and that is where the residual now
	 *         lives: with orders reduced to one name set and one code set, "one order carrying two
	 *         codes" and "two orders each carrying one" are the same input, so no reduction strong
	 *         enough to catch the first spares the genuine two-order pair the ATC leg exists to find (a

	 * The bridged-concept leg's answer for ONE pass: which reference entries the dataset's dictionary

	 *
	 * <p><b>Why it is carried rather than asked.</b> The leg is RANKED — see
	 * {@link DrugReferenceService#findByBridgedConcept} for why an unranked one is unsafe here — and
	 * ranking costs a dataset resolution per concept. Asked at {@link #resolvesFrom}, which runs once
	 * per (row, order) pair inside two nested loops, that would be a resolution per comparison. So it
	 * is resolved once for the pass and travels as a parameter: a per-call LOCAL and never a field,
	 * this bean being a Spring singleton (issue #172), and the same shape issue #255 gave the resolved
	 * order list.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Resolved LAZILY</b>, on the first arm that asks — {@code CoMedications}' rule and for its
	 * reason. Every consumer of this is inside an interaction arm, so a pass whose toggles are off, or
	 * whose question and answer put no substance in play, resolves nothing; an eager hoist in
	 * {@code validate} would make the commonest question pay for a leg no chip in it can reach. The
	 * work it defers is one dataset walk per active order plus one ranked resolution per distinct
	 * bridged concept, which {@code DrugReferenceService.findForActiveOrders} has already performed for
	 * its own candidate set — so the pass pays it twice or not at all, and this is which.
	 *
	 * <p>Keyed by object IDENTITY on the order, not by its uuid, which may be null. What makes that
	 * grain right is that every site asking {@link #resolvesFrom} iterates the OUTER
	 * {@code context.getActiveDrugOrders()} — the same list this holder was built from, carried
	 * through {@link DrugReferenceService#withReferenceNames} as the same objects. It is NOT that the
	 * contexts {@link #activeOrdersOtherThan} derives share them: those carry no orders at all. A
	 * change that gave them orders would have to keep the objects, or this holder answers false for
	 * every one of them and the leg silently contributes nothing at the suppression sites.
	 * {@link #NONE} is the answer for a pass with no chart to read and for a caller-built context whose
	 * orders record no concept — the ordinary state of a hand-built one — and it makes the leg
	 * contribute nothing rather than throw.

	 *         {@link #displaysANameOfAny}, over the one name a chart record displays, so an over-wide

	 *         subject's interaction PARTNER, so an over-wide answer misses a pair and can never invent
	 *         one. Reaching such a pair needs the subject in play by another route (an answer naming the
	 *         ester outright) AND a rule between the two — unmeasured on the shipped KB, so narrowing it

	 *         grouping, the name and log label {@link #addActiveOrderPairInteractions} gives a screened
	 *         pair, and the cross-arm key in {@link InteractionPairs} — so it is resolved once and carried
	 *         rather than asked again by each of them. Issue #136 made it two consumers; keeping them in
	 *         step by re-running the same scan was the arrangement, and carrying the result removes the
	 *         chance of a pair being named after one entry and grouped under another.
	 *
	 *         <p>Shared with {@link DrugReferenceInjector#orderedInteractionNotes} since issue #190 item
	 *         2, whose partner grouping is the RECORD's counterpart of {@link #bestRulePerPartner}'s:
	 *         two names of one active order (issue #136's {@code warfarin}/{@code coumadin}) were two
	 *         notes beside one chip because the record keyed on the label alone. It keys on this answer
	 *         first now, for the same reason the two must agree on which rows are one partner — and it is
	 *         this method rather than a second resolution, because a second one is how the two come to
	 *         name a partner twice again.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Which of several candidates, since issue #353's review round 3: the one whose claim
	 *         on the rule's token is STRONGEST</b> — {@link DrugReference#nameMatchStrength}, which
	 *         CLAUDE.md designates as the one answer to how strongly an entry claims a recorded name. It
	 *         took the FIRST candidate {@link #identifies} admitted, and this knowledge base gives one
	 *         token to two substances routinely: the {@code ddinter} parser writes a rule's token from
	 *         the partner's {@code rxnorm_name} and files that name in the partner's own aliases, so
	 *         {@code esomeprazole} is Esomeprazole's display name AND Omeprazole's alias. A chip
	 *         printing that token then had issue #349's chart-order clause decided against the OTHER
	 *         substance's rows — {@link #restsOnAnAmbiguousBridge} is asked of
	 *         {@link #rowsOfSubstance} of whatever this answers — so the substance the bridge's own name
	 *         names stated no prescription, and which way it fell was decided by which of the two rows
	 *         the knowledge-base file lists first. Reproduced by swapping exactly those two rows of a
	 *         fixture; {@code BridgedConceptOrderResolutionTest.theBridgedClauseIsAskedOfTheSubstanceAndNotOfTheDatasetsRowOrder}
	 *         asserts the outcome under both orders, and mutating this scan back to the first match
	 *         reddens it.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>A refinement of the CHOICE and never of the SET</b>, which is the shape
	 *         {@code nameMatchStrength}'s own {@link DrugReference#matchesDrugName} gate has:
	 *         {@link #identifies} still decides which candidates exist, so this can return no entry it
	 *         did not return before and cannot fail to return one where it returned something. Two
	 *         consequences worth stating rather than leaving to be found. A candidate
	 *         {@link #identifies} by the rule's ATC CODE alone scores
	 *         {@link DrugReference#NAME_NO_MATCH} and therefore now loses to any candidate the token NAMES, which it could
	 *         previously beat by arriving first. And the ranking cannot separate two entries that each carry the token as an alias
	 *         while neither is CALLED it — there the first is still kept, so for that shape the answer is the dataset's own order
	 *         exactly as it always was, and the residue is a clause withheld rather than one misattributed. Pinned since review
	 *         round 4 by {@code BridgedConceptOrderResolutionTest.aTiedTokenIsAnsweredByTheFirstOfTheTiedRowsFromEitherRowOrder}.
	 *
	 *         <p>It no longer stops at the first admitted candidate, so the scan is the whole
	 *         order-entry list rather than a prefix of it. That list is the patient's own resolved
	 *         orders, and the added work is one {@code nameMatchStrength} per candidate the gate
	 *         admits — unmeasured, over a list that is the patient's own resolved orders. The site
	 *         reaching it for EVERY rule of an entry is
	 *         {@code DrugReferenceInjector.onePerPartner}, ungated, and there the full walk was already
	 *         the common case: most of an entry's partners are drugs this patient is not on, and for
	 *         those nothing was admitted and nothing short-circuited. {@link #bestRulePerPartner} asks
	 *         only about rules a {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasActiveDrug} join has already passed.
	 *
	 *         <p>{@link DrugReference#canonicalRow} is deliberately NOT composed underneath it. Its
	 *         second rung is scoped to one substance but its first is not, so folding it over
	 *         candidates the ranking tied would elect ACROSS substances on route-qualification, which is
	 *         the issue #187 direction. Which ROW a partner is printed from is a different question and
	 *         {@link SubstanceSubjects#subjectOf} already answers it for every name slot.
	 *
	 *         <p>Name IDENTITY, deliberately not {@link DrugReference#matchesText}. A rule's token is
	 *         exactly its partner's own alias (the {@code ddinter} parser writes it from the partner's
	 *         RxNorm generic and puts that in the partner's aliases), whereas a whole-word scan also
	 *         matches any SHORTER entry whose alias sits inside a multi-word token — "insulin" inside
	 *         "insulin glargine". One order name resolves both entries, so a first-match scan handed
	 *         back the wrong one, the reverse direction of the symmetric row keyed on the right one,
	 *         and one interaction was chipped twice in opposite directions with the withheld-pair log
	 *         naming the wrong drug. Measured on a fixture through the real parser.

	 * Allergy-driven contraindication reasoning: for the drug {@code ref} being checked, each recorded

	 * fires when one of them is the same SUBSTANCE as {@code ref} (a recorded allergy to the very drug
	 * being checked), shares {@code ref}'s ATC level-4 subgroup (cross-reactivity), or — failing both —
	 * shares a curated {@link CrossReactivityGroup}
	 * (cross-<em>branch</em> cross-reactivity, e.g. aspirin vs an ibuprofen allergy, which ATC's tree
	 * cannot express). At most one warning per (SUBSTANCE, ALLERGEN'S SUBSTANCE): the most specific match
	 * wins, several aliases of one allergy warn once ({@link #recordedAllergens} de-duplicates them), a
	 * recorded name denoting several substances warns once (each comparison below stops at its first
	 * match), the several reference rows one substance is filed as warn once between them, and so do
	 * two allergy RECORDS for two presentations of one substance
	 * ({@link ContraindicationChips}, issue #145 — the ledger this arm adds to rather than appending to
	 * the chip list, and the reason it takes one). That ledger is shared with the curated arm, whose
	 * allergy rules NAMING their own entry land on this arm's key since issue #146 and report the same
	 * fact; so "at most one" spans the two arms and not only this one's own loop.
	 * The two class comparisons need only ATC codes, which
	 * is how an authoritative classification source carrying no rules ({@link AtcDrugReferenceSource})
	 * still produces allergy reasoning.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The direct allergy leads (issue #388).</b> One drug can carry an identity finding AND a
	 * class finding raised by a DIFFERENT recorded allergen: they are two findings about two records,
	 * two keys in {@link ContraindicationChips}, and both are kept. Which of them LEADS used to be
	 * decided by the order the chart returned the allergy records, because one loop raised whichever
	 * relationship each allergen produced as it reached it. It is now decided here: the identity
	 * comparison is made for every recorded allergen before any class comparison is made for any of
	 * them. <b>What that reaches</b> is the order the chips are serialized in — measured on the issue's
	 * own reproduction, ADR Decision 82 — and, following from that, the order
	 * {@link DrugReferenceInjector} numbers the {@code safety_finding} records, which it writes in this
	 * list's order. It licenses NO claim about the ANSWER — the prompt is handed a set whose order is
	 * not stated to the model (ADR Decision 37) — so do not read it as putting the identity finding in
	 * front of the answer, and do not read the refusal as a denial: what the emission order of this
	 * same list does for a truncated answer is issue #346's question, at
	 * {@link #FINDING_STRENGTH_DESCENDING}. Ordering rather than
	 * suppressing is the same choice {@link #FINDING_STRENGTH_DESCENDING} makes for the interaction
	 * arm; ADR Decision 82 is canonical for the alternative that was weighed and declined.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Scoped to this arm, which is narrower than "this drug's chips".</b> It orders the two
	 * claims THIS arm makes about one subject and nothing else. Where a curated rule's chip sits is
	 * {@link #contraindicationRank} and the ledger's business — a self-named allergy rule shares the
	 * identity chip's key and can replace it in place (issue #146) — and nothing here moves it.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Identity is not classification (issue #135).</b> The three comparisons were all gated on
	 * one early return taken when {@code ref} had neither an ATC subgroup nor a curated group. That
	 * guard is right for the two class comparisons — without a subgroup or a group there is nothing to
	 * compare against — but the identity comparison is between the two drugs themselves: it needs
	 * no ATC code, no group, and no dataset support of any kind, and gating it on classification data
	 * silently skipped the most basic check the module makes. Measured over the full
	 * openmrs-ddi-knowledge-base DDInter 2.0 dataset (2283 drugs) on 2026-08-05: <b>444 entries
	 * (19.4%) carry no ATC codes at all</b>, and 0 carry ATC codes without a level-4 subgroup — so the
	 * guard's two halves fail together, on nearly a fifth of the dataset (Ledipasvir, Leucovorin,
	 * Levomefolic acid, Kava, Lactic acid, Anthrax vaccine …). Nothing else covered those drugs:
	 * {@link #addContraindications} reads only curated {@code contraindications}, which
	 * {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource} never emits, and a curated {@link CrossReactivityGroup} cannot
	 * rescue them <em>in principle</em> rather than merely in practice — membership is defined by ATC
	 * PREFIX ({@link CrossReactivityGroup#containsCode}), so an entry with no ATC code can belong to no
	 * group however much curated data a deployment authors. The warning had no path to the clinician at
	 * all: no chip, and since issue #110 turns every chip into a citable pre-answer record, nothing in
	 * the prompt either.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why the identity check stays here</b> rather than moving to {@link #addContraindications},
	 * the curated/rule arm. Two invariants are decided per resolved allergen and need code that sees
	 * all three comparisons at once: <em>most-specific-match wins</em> (an allergen that IS this drug
	 * also shares every one of its subgroups, so identity must pre-empt the class arms rather than
	 * stack on them — and since issues #193/#195 that precedence spans the whole set of substances one
	 * recorded name denotes, so it cannot be decided a member at a time either) and <em>one warning per
	 * recorded allergy</em> — the wider collapse, across two allergy RECORDS that name one substance, is
	 * the ledger's key and not this loop's. Split across two methods, each would need its own copy
	 * of the other's state — which is precisely the two-arms-cannot-see-each-other shape that produced
	 * issue #88's duplicate interaction chip. {@link #addContraindications} also walks a different
	 * collection ({@code ref.getContraindications()}, matched by token against allergy AND condition
	 * text), so hosting the allergen walk there would put two unrelated loops in one method and still
	 * leave the precedence decision spanning both. What was wrong was the guard's placement, not the
	 * home; the method name said "class" because two of its three comparisons are class-based.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Coverage bound, measured.</b> Identity is only as sound as the resolution behind it, and
	 * {@link DrugReferenceService#findImpliedSubstances} resolves the allergy token to every SUBSTANCE
	 * that name denotes — by the drug-NAME rule since issue #147, not the whole-word one, ranked rather
	 * than first-past-the-post since issue #176, and set-valued rather than one entry since issues
	 * #193/#195. Measured over the full KB, asking about each of the 444 ATC-less entries with an allergy
	 * recorded under that entry's own name: every one raises a contraindication, and every one now names
	 * ITSELF. Before #176, <b>53 of them named a DIFFERENT entry</b> — 43 where every alias that matched
	 * was a strict FRAGMENT of the queried name ({@code Loteprednol etabonate} resolving to
	 * {@code Loteprednol (ophthalmic)}), 10 where the earlier entry carried the queried name in FULL
	 * among its own aliases ({@code Moderna covid-19 vaccine} resolving to
	 * {@code Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine}, whose CIEL list contains it verbatim). Both shapes are
	 * separated by the claim ranking, which is why it is a rank and not the longest-alias preference this
	 * javadoc used to record as resolving only the first 43.
	 *
	 * <p>An allergy recorded as free text rather than as a drug name still resolves by the containment
	 * rule or not at all. Separately, an ANSWER-named drug can still be echo-scoped out of play before
	 * this arm sees it (issue #105, {@link #isEchoOfAttributableRecord}) — the 444 measurement is of the
	 * question-driven path, which is never echo-scoped.
	 *
	 * <p><b>One recorded name, several substances, still one chip.</b> The precedence below is decided
	 * ACROSS the implied set and not per member, which is what keeps the strongest true statement:
	 * a patient allergic to {@code abacavir / lamivudine} asked about lamivudine is told they are
	 * allergic to it, rather than that it cross-reacts with the abacavir in the same tablet. And the
	 * loop raises at most ONE chip per recorded allergy per subject, so a subject related to two of the
	 * implied substances — zidovudine shares {@code J05AF} with both of those constituents — reports the
	 * one clinical fact once. The ledger behind it collapses the wider case, two allergy RECORDS naming
	 * one substance: for EVERY one of the 129 substances the shipped KB files as more than one row,
	 * measured 2026-08-08 by recording two of a family's rows as two allergies and running validate over
	 * each family in turn — 2 identity chips keyed on the resolved row, 1 keyed on the substance, 129 of
	 * 129 either way.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What a correct resolution still costs.</b> Driven through this method by {@code validate}
	 * for each distinct published name whose resolution the ranking moves — ONE recorded allergy per
	 * probe, asking about the row the pre-#192 rule landed on (2026-08-09, over the 5169 distinct names
	 * the shipped KB publishes; re-measure before relying on the figures): resolution moves for 265 of
	 * them and 87 raised no contraindication at all. Reading the recorded name as the substances it
	 * denotes brings 23 of those 87 back and silences none. Most of the remaining 64 are #192's own
	 * correct withdrawals, where the row the old rule landed on was never the recorded drug — the
	 * {@code …lactate} and {@code …salicylate} salts that used to resolve to {@code Lactic acid} and
	 * {@code Salicylic acid}, {@code Moderna covid-19 vaccine} against the Pfizer row,
	 * {@code digoxin antibodies fab fragments} against {@code Digoxin}. What is genuinely left is the
	 * shape no rule over NAMES can reach: a moiety the KB names by a bare WORD rather than by a
	 * trailing qualifier ({@code Peanut oil} against {@code Peanut}, {@code Dextran 40},
	 * {@code penicillin g, procaine}), which is spelled exactly like
	 * {@code Digoxin Immune Fab (Ovine)} against {@code Digoxin}, the patient allergic to digoxin's
	 * ANTIDOTE that issue #192 measured and separated — plus a constituent the KB publishes no name for
	 * at all ({@code apple pectin}, {@code dextran 70}). See
	 * {@link DrugReferenceService#findImpliedSubstances} for the gates and
	 * {@code PresentationMoietyAllergenTest} for the bound pinned as a test.

	 *         {@link PatientClinicalContext#contraindicationRecordsRead} as well.
	 *
	 *         <p>The keys are {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()} — the very values
	 *         {@link #firstOfSameSubstance} compares, from the very walk
	 *         {@link #recordedAllergens} builds for that arm, so "would that arm raise its IDENTITY chip
	 *         for this substance from some record" cannot come to have two answers. A set rather than
	 *         that method because the caller has no row to scan and does not want one: it holds the
	 *         entry and asks about it.
	 *
	 *         <p>The WHOLE list is what separates this from {@link #aMatchedRecordNamesTheEntry}, and
	 *         the pair is not interchangeable in either direction (issue #269). This one is satisfied by

	 *         while the rank keeps its full {@code SELF_NAMED_RULE}. A consumer wanting "is this rule
	 *         corroborated at all" takes the UNION, which can hedge nothing either half admits.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>The caller's {@link DrugReference} must come from the same service.</b>
	 *         {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()} is the substance name where the data publishes

	 *         {@code equals}, so for a curated entry publishing no substance name membership here is
	 *         object identity. That is the same condition {@link #firstOfSameSubstance} has always run

	 *         a bean boundary: {@code DrugReferenceInjector} passes its OWN
	 *         {@link DrugReferenceService}, which is also where the entries it renders come from, so the
	 *         two sides are the same objects. Two services would parse the dataset twice and this set
	 *         would silently contain nothing the caller can find.
	 *
	 *         <p>Static and service-taking rather than an instance method: its consumer is
	 *         {@code DrugReferenceInjector}, whose {@code drugSafetyValidator} may be absent while its
	 *         {@code drugReferenceService} is not, and an answer that went missing there would silently
	 *         report every self-named rule as uncorroborated. Resolved per call and held by the caller

	 *         {@code DrugReferenceInjector.corroborated}, which is where the reasoning has lived since

	 *         one reason — the injected {@code drug_reference} section and the injected
	 *         {@code safety_finding} beside it report ONE fact about ONE chart, and issue #308
	 *         measured what happens when only one of them is qualified: the model answers from the
	 *         bare one. Two copies of this predicate is how they would come apart again, silently,
	 *         since nothing errors when a hedge and an assertion sit side by side.
	 *
	 *         <p>{@code allergicSubstances} is a supplier and not a set deliberately: leg 2 is a
	 *         dataset sweep and leg 1 reads only the context and the entry, so the cost order the
	 *         injector documents is preserved here rather than at one caller. The injector hands its
	 *         own lazily memoised reading; {@code validate} hands a set it has already derived from
	 *         the walk it does once per pass.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Both sides must hold the same {@link DrugReferenceService}</b>, and since this method
	 *         is the one both channels ask, the condition belongs here rather than only on
	 *         {@link #allergicSubstanceKeys}. Leg 2 compares {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()},

	 *         not. Where it is the ROW, membership is object identity, and a validator holding a second
	 *         service would answer differently from the injector rendering the record: the two channels
	 *         back to disagreeing about one chart, which is what this method exists to prevent. That is
	 *         the shape the BUNDLED curated seed has — it publishes no {@code substanceName} at all —
	 *         and it is the only bundled population that can reach this method, since neither the
	 *         {@code ddinter} nor the {@code atc} parser publishes a contraindication rule (ADR
	 *         Decision 44 re-measures all three). An operator's own {@code json} entry MAY set one,
	 *         which Jackson binds straight onto {@link DrugReference} and which
	 *         {@code DrugReferenceValidity.RULES_WITHOUT_A_SUBSTANCE_IDENTITY} steers a deployment
	 *         toward; the key is then a string and two services would agree, so what this condition is
	 *         really about is the identity case rather than every dataset. Not constructible today —
	 *         both beans are Spring singletons in one context and
	 *         {@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.injectorWithSafety} wires one service into both — and that
	 *         is what makes the condition hold, rather than anything either class checks.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>This answers about one RULE. A collapsed KEY is a fold over its rules</b>, and that
	 *         resolution belongs to {@link #addContraindications}, not to this method: two self-named
	 *         rules of one entry are ONE chip and one rendered clause (issue #146), so one corroborated
	 *         rule carries the key. Asking this per rule and reading the answer off whichever rule won
	 *         the ledger's RANK is not the same thing, and the difference is reachable — see issue
	 *         #308 and ADR Decision 44, which record three ways of getting the unit wrong.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>The two allergy legs are scoped to a SELF-NAMED allergy rule</b> — the scope is the
	 *         union's and not the method's — and it is load-bearing rather than incidental:
	 *         a rule whose token is not one of its entry's names is asking about a class or about a
	 *         fragment of free text, which is what the bare match exists for, and neither of the ALLERGY
	 *         corroborating questions can speak to it. Mutate the scope out and read the failures.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>A CONDITION rule is corroborated by a different question, and it is not one of the
	 *         two above</b> (issue #309). Its token reached the condition list through the same bare
	 *         containment, so the same accident is available — {@code liver} inside a condition recorded

	/**
	 * The contraindication question no other arm asks: <b>is the patient allergic to — or does an
	 * active condition of theirs contraindicate — something they are already TAKING?</b> (Issue #143.)
	 * The two contraindication arms above, run over the patient's own active orders instead of over the
	 * drugs the question and the answer name.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The defect.</b> Both contraindication arms were keyed on a drug IN PLAY, and echo scoping
	 * ({@link #isEchoOfAttributableRecord}, issue #105) removes an answer-named drug from that set
	 * whenever a record the mention is attributable to already names it — a record the answer cites,
	 * or, since issue #360, any of this module's own recitable reference records. A drug the patient
	 * is PRESCRIBED appears in a
	 * {@code drug_order} chart record — which is exactly the record a good answer cites when asked
	 * about medications — so the scoping fired on the one shape where the finding matters most.
	 * Measured on the bundled curated dataset ({@code sourceFormat=json}, the production default when this
	 * was measured): an
	 * active ibuprofen order plus an ibuprofen allergy, a question naming no drug and an answer citing
	 * the real order record raised <b>0 chips</b>, where the identical call with {@code mappings=null}
	 * raised <b>2</b> — which is <b>1</b> since issue #146, those two having been the curated rule and
	 * the identity check reporting one allergy twice rather than two findings. An allergy to a
	 * currently-prescribed drug is a prescribing error the chart
	 * already contains, and it reached the clinician as neither a chip nor anything in the prompt: the
	 * pre-answer findings issue #110 injects come from this same {@code validate}, so an arm that
	 * raises nothing puts nothing in front of the model either.
	 *
	 * <p>That implication is the one this paragraph needs, and it still holds. Its CONVERSE does not,
	 * since {@link SubjectMatter}: a chip this arm raises because the ANSWER or a cited record named
	 * the drug has no pre-answer record behind it, the prompt pass having run on the question alone.
	 * Other comments in this class still put the converse as a general property of issue #110 — they
	 * are about drug-in-play chips, where a drug only the ANSWER names has never had a pre-answer
	 * record either, so the looseness is older than this arm and correcting it is its own pass.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why this arm rather than exempting contraindications from the scoping.</b> A carve-out
	 * would fix the measured case and nothing past it, because it still needs the ANSWER to name the
	 * drug: a prescribing error nobody happened to write down stays invisible, and that is not a corner
	 * — the pre-answer findings pass ({@code DrugReferenceInjector.preAnswerFindings}) calls
	 * {@code validate} with an EMPTY answer, so for a question naming no drug there is no answer text
	 * to name anything. A carve-out would also widen #105's own over-reach onto this surface: a drug the
	 * answer merely recites out of a cited allergy or reference record would become
	 * contraindication-checked, chipping about a drug nobody proposed giving. Keyed on the patient's
	 * active orders, neither happens — and the claim {@code isEchoOfAttributableRecord} makes about
	 * actively-ordered drugs becomes true instead of being relaxed.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Contraindications only.</b> Not interactions: {@link #addInteractionWarnings} over an
	 * active-order entry against the patient's own orders IS {@link #addActiveOrderPairInteractions},
	 * which is deliberately gated on the question asking to be screened (issue #113) and would here run
	 * ungated, uncapped, and without that arm's {@link #activeOrdersOtherThan} reduction — so one order
	 * would witness a pair with itself, as one {@code Aspirin and omeprazole} order did when it reported
	 * "Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) interacts with active order esomeprazole", the two halves of one
	 * tablet as an interacting pair (measured; see {@link #activeOrdersOtherThan}). And not
	 * overdose: {@link #addOverdose} reads a dose out of the ANSWER, so an order the answer never
	 * mentions has no dose to check, and reinstating an echoed drug's dose check is precisely what #105
	 * measured and fixed.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Bounded by the response's subject matter, not by the question's wording.</b> This paragraph
	 * used to read "not gated on the question, deliberately", and the reasoning it gave — that "is the
	 * patient allergic to something they are taking?" is a fact about the chart rather than about the
	 * wording of a query — is still true and is still not a licence to answer it unasked. Unbounded,
	 * the arm put the identical chips on every response: measured live on the 3.7.1 standalone, four
	 * questions about allergies, interactions, cancer and a date of birth returned the same two,
	 * byte for byte. This module annotates answers and has none of an alerting system's machinery, so
	 * the arm is bounded by {@link SubjectMatter} — a chip is raised where either SIDE of it, the drug
	 * or the recorded finding, is part of what the response is about. That is deliberately NOT a gate
	 * on the question's wording, which is the thing this defect taught: a question naming a drug
	 * carries no medication cue word at all, and the answer and the cited records count as much as the
	 * question. What it gives up has a surface of its own since issue #280 —
	 * {@link #standingChartAlerts(Patient)}, the one caller that asks for
	 * {@link SubjectMatterScope#UNBOUNDED} — and that is not a reason to relax the bound here, since a
	 * client asks for that one. What bounds the arm besides is the chart: it can only fire where an allergy or
	 * condition record and an active order point at the same drug, and the two arms it delegates to
	 * bound it further — one chip per
	 * (substance, allergen's substance) and one per (substance, matching curated rule), those two being
	 * ONE bound wherever the rule names the substance itself (issue #146), through the same
	 * {@link ContraindicationChips} ledger the drug-in-play call site uses, which is what stops one
		 * order that resolves several reference rows raising a chip per row (issue #145). That is a bound
	 * in the patient's own records, the same kind every other contraindication chip has and the reason
	 * the pairwise arms need {@link #maxPairChips()} while this one does not: nothing here is quadratic
	 * in a list the module does not choose.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The precondition.</b> With neither allergy nor condition tokens recorded both arms are
	 * provably no-ops — every branch of {@link #addContraindications} requires
	 * {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasAllergyToken} or
	 * {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasConditionToken}, and
	 * {@link #addAllergyContraindications} returns at once on an empty allergen list — the allergens
	 * being {@link #recordedAllergens}' resolution of {@link PatientClinicalContext#getAllergyTokens()},
	 * and that method's own javadoc is where its shape is described rather than here — so
	 * the check is skipped rather than run to find nothing. What it saves is the two arms' own work over
	 * every order subject, not the resolution of those subjects: since issue #136 {@code validate}
	 * resolves them once per pass whatever the question, because
	 * {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasActiveDrug} needs their names. (Before that, this precondition
	 * also spared the resolution, and its javadoc said so.) Read BOTH token sets, not just allergies:
	 * the curated arm's condition leg is half of what the scoping was suppressing.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Composition.</b> An entry already in {@code inPlay} is skipped, so a prescribed drug the
	 * question also names is checked once rather than twice — identity is the right test because both
	 * sets resolve against the service's shared {@code getAll()} cache (the same reason the drugs-in-play
	 * set can dedup by identity). Nothing downstream double-counts either: the screening arm seeds its
	 * suppression set from the chips raised so far, and these are {@code TYPE_CONTRAINDICATION} while
	 * every chip that arm can raise is {@code TYPE_INTERACTION}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it still cannot find</b>, stated rather than implied: an order whose substance the
	 * loaded dataset does not carry resolves to no entry at all, so it has nothing to compare — the same
	 * limit {@link DrugReferenceService#findForActiveOrders} documents for the screen. And the arms it
	 * delegates to decide the rest: an allergy token {@link DrugReferenceService#findImpliedSubstances}
	 * cannot resolve to the drug the chart means — free text naming no entry — is labelled here exactly
	 * as it is on the question path (see {@link #addAllergyContraindications}'s measured coverage
	 * bound). A combination product naming several used to be on that list and is not since issues
	 * #193/#195.

	 *       the flattened code set (issue #118's fallback) no order names the partner, so the partner
	 *       is whichever row {@link #entryForAtcCode} picks for the code — and that row's substance
	 *       need not be the queried one. An order known only as {@code A02BC05} resolves to
	 *       {@code Omeprazole}, the earlier row, so dropping this leg would newly raise a chip about
	 *       {@code Esomeprazole} against it, which this arm has never raised.
	 *       <p>Not because a level-5 code cannot be shared by two substances — in THIS knowledge base
	 *       it can, and the pair just named is the counterexample: {@code Omeprazole} and

	 *       unqualified "sharing an exact ATC code means being the same substance" on
	 *       {@link #resolvesFrom} is a claim about ATC the standard, and is false of this KB.) So the
	 *       leg CAN over-skip, and does exactly there — deliberately, because what it skips is a
	 *       partner the dataset can only name as {@code Omeprazole} anyway. Keeping it is a choice

	 * which codes are skipped, which family wins, how the sentence reads — is unchanged.
	 *
	 * <p>Its PARTS rather than a finished sentence, since issue #292 — but for the same reason the
	 * finished sentence was chosen: it must read identically on both surfaces, as the whole detail of a
	 * class-only chip and as the second sentence of a folded one, and {@link ClassRelationship#sentence}
	 * is now the one thing that words it (the template used to be written out twice here, once per
	 * family). What the parts buy is that the partner's NAME becomes an argument, which a folded chip
	 * needs because only the fold knows both arms' names for one order. Issue
	 * #108 made every chip detail a standalone sentence led by the subject's display label and naming
	 * the order by the dataset entry's, and
	 * {@code DrugSafetyChipLabelTest.classChipOrderNamesCarryBothVocabularies} pins that phrasing; two
	 * attempts to shorten it for the folded chip broke that pin in turn — referring back to "that
	 * order" dropped the synonym-augmented order label, and prefixing "also" (to acknowledge the

	 * <p><b>One sentence per co-medication, not per shared code (issue #171).</b> This walked
	 * {@link PatientClinicalContext#getActiveDrugAtcCodes()} and emitted a sentence per CODE, so a
	 * partner filed under several codes produced a sentence per shared subgroup — identical but for the
	 * class named. Measured inputs: the 3.7.1 demo dictionary's {@code Metronidazole} concept carries
	 * five {@code WHOATC} maps and shares three level-4 subgroups with tinidazole, with no rated KB row
	 * to fold them into, so one clinical fact reached the clinician three times. The codes are
	 * therefore grouped by the co-medication they identify ({@link #orderPartners}) before anything is
	 * worded, and WHICH class the one sentence names is {@link #sharedClass}'s decision over the whole
	 * shared set — the same decision the allergy arm makes, so neither depends on the order a
	 * dictionary published its mappings in. That decision is one method and not two, which is what
	 * issue #171 asked for; since issues #183/#184 it also takes the ARM as a parameter, so the two
	 * arms share the preference and NOT the candidate set, and may name different subgroups for one
	 * pair where each claim is honestly about a different one. See {@link #sharedClass}, which
	 * measures how often.
	 *
	 * @return the class relationship for each active-order partner that has one — its parts, worded by
	 *         {@link ClassRelationship#sentence} once the partner's name is decided — keyed by that
	 *         partner, in partner FIRST-APPEARANCE order over the context's codes and then over the
	 *         orders none of those codes reached (issue #228); empty when the drug is in no class or
	 *         group at all.
	 *         <p>Not the same as the per-code order this returned before issue #171, and the difference
	 *         is observable: a partner whose first code shares nothing now sorts by that first code
	 *         rather than by the code that produced its sentence, so it can precede a partner that the
	 *         per-code walk put ahead of it. Chip CONTENT is unchanged; two class-only chips can swap

		 * admits an order only where that flag is true; and no constructor takes the label and the flag as
		 * separate arguments any more, so neither can be supplied disagreeing with the other.
		 *
		 * <p>Until issue #298 that did not hold. The order rung set this whenever an order was consulted
		 * while {@link #namesADrug} came from {@link DrugSafetyValidator#displayNamesADrug}, so a
		 * {@code namedByCodesOnly} or blank-display order left a non-null value here beside an
		 * {@code [ATC …]} or bare-code label, and the only thing keeping the fold safe was the ORDER OF
		 * {@code reconciledPartnerName}'s BRANCHES — {@code !namesADrug} tested first.
		 *
		 * <p><b>That branch order is still what {@code reconciledPartnerName} uses, and is deliberately kept.</b>
		 * Reversing it — so that this field is read first — was implemented and reverted in review of issue
		 * #298, on the measurement that it would make the invariant above the ONLY thing between an
		 * inconsistent pair and a bare ATC code reaching BOTH sentences of a folded chip (and, through
		 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.renderFinding}, the prompt as citable {@code safety_finding} text).
		 * <b>Issue #293 retired that measurement and the branch order stays anyway</b>, which is worth
		 * separating rather than quietly leaving the old sentence to rot: since
		 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#namesNamingOrder} reads the naming order's DISPLAY, a bare code or an
		 * {@code [ATC …]} stand-in fails {@code matchesOrderName} and the fold refuses, so the reversed
		 * state now costs a code in the CLASS sentence alone — where the ladder's label already was —
		 * rather than in both. Re-measured under the reversal: the pre-#298 write path plus reversed
		 * branches prints the code once, and printing it twice needs the pre-#293 predicate as well. What
		 * survives is the ordinary defence-in-depth reason — the guards are independent, so a future rung
		 * that reaches this field cannot spend one of them by accident — and the residual cost above. So:
		 * do not read a non-null value here as licence to hand out {@link #label} without asking
		 * {@link #namesADrug}, and do not reverse the branches to make this field load-bearing. ADR Decision 40 records the reasoning; what pins the single write
		 * path is {@code OrderPartnerNameSourceWritePathTest}, structurally, because a behaviour-neutral
		 * rule has nothing a behavioural assertion can see.
		 *
		 * <p>What it still does NOT mean is that this order is the ONLY prescription behind the partner:
		 * several can reach one ({@link DrugSafetyValidator#ordersCarrying}), and this is the one whose
		 * display became the label. A rung wanting "which orders contributed this partner, named or not"
		 * wants a different field, not a widening of this one — {@link DrugSafetyValidator#namesNamingOrder}

		 * one case #290 added — a partly-covered nameless order keeps the dataset's name and still

		 * named, so it stands for exactly one substance and holds exactly that one — never the rest of
		 * the tablet, or a question about one constituent of an unmapped combination would lose the chip
		 * naming the other, which is the loss the paragraph above describes.
		 *
		 * <p>On that rung it is the WHOLE of the skip, not a second opinion beside the exact-code leg:
		 * that leg is scoped out there ({@link #codesFromDataset}), because with the partner's codes
		 * taken from the dataset it would be asking whether two reference rows share a code, which this
		 * knowledge base says is not identity. So deleting this one line raises the self-chip issue #185
		 * exists to prevent — measured 2026-08-13, three cases redden.
		 *
		 * <p>Worth recording that it was not always so: while the code leg still applied here, deleting
		 * this line left every api test green, because the leg answered the same question wherever such
		 * a partner could raise a chip at all. That was a guard protected by nothing, and scoping the
		 * leg to the case it was kept for is what made it load-bearing rather than a second expression
		 * of the same rule.
		 *
		 * <p><b>The names, and not also the entry the ladder resolved.</b> That entry's substance is
		 * already what the skip's exact-code leg answers, and equivalently so: a row of it publishes
		 * the code that resolved it, and every row of one substance in the shipped KB publishes the
		 * same codes — the DATA invariant {@link DrugSafetyValidator#addInteractionWarnings} already
		 * rests on and already asks to be re-measured on a KB refresh. Adding it here would be a
		 * second, unreachable expression of one rule.
		 *
		 * <p><b>The names are needed because the codes cannot answer for a combination.</b> A
		 * fixed-dose combination resolves an entry for one constituent while its name names the
		 * other, and its combination code is typically absent from the KB. The 3.7.1 demo
		 * dictionary's {@code Isoniazid / Rifapentine} concept is exactly that — {@code J04AB05}
		 * resolves Rifapentine and {@code J04AC51} resolves nothing, which merges both codes onto ONE
		 * partner and renames it after the order — so a skip reading only what the codes resolve
		 * reports the isoniazid in the tablet as duplicating the tablet.
		 *
		 * <p>A SET rather than one key, because a combination names several and because a partner can be
		 * reached by more than one order. What it holds is what EVERY order carrying an unnameable code
		 * of this partner names — not what every order merged into the partner names: two orders of one
		 * substance that merged through their COVERED codes contribute nothing here, and need not,
		 * because the exact-code leg already answers for a code the dataset could name.
		 *
		 * <p><b>The bound this scoping leaves.</b> A combination order whose combination code the KB
		 * DOES carry never reaches this rung at all, so a question about one of its constituents still
		 * gets the self-chip. That is not closable from here — reading the order's names for a covered
		 * code is exactly the over-skip above — and it is unreachable on the shipped KB, which carries
		 * no row for any of the combination codes the 3.7.1 demo dictionary maps. Closing it needs the

		 * SHAPE and not merely that the flag is mentioned, because its first version asked the latter and

		 * A behavioural test cannot
		 * see either, the change being behaviour-neutral; the scan's own javadoc says what it does not
		 * cover.

		 * Re-name this partner after the ORDER, because one of the codes it holds is a code the

		 * first.
		 *
		 * <p>Why the order wins there. The dataset names the substance the COVERED codes identify;
		 * it says nothing about the uncovered one, and the two need not be the same substance. The
		 * 3.7.1 demo dictionary's {@code Isoniazid / Rifapentine} concept is exactly that: the loaded
		 * KB covers {@code J04AB05} (rifapentine) and not {@code J04AC51}, and naming the merged
		 * partner "Rifapentine" produces "…is in the same ATC class (J04AC) as active order
		 * Rifapentine", a chip whose stated class does not classify the drug it names — the
		 * right-finding-wrong-reason failure issue #161 fixed on the allergy arm. The order's own
		 * display name is true of everything the order contains, which is what a partner holding an
		 * unnameable code needs.
		 *
		 * <p><b>That last premise is no longer unconditional, and issue #293 is what weakened it.</b>
		 * An order's display is now the free text a clinician typed wherever there is any, and the
		 * codes are still the concept's — so where those two disagree, this hands the class sentence a
		 * name the cited subgroup does not classify. Measured through the real builder and the real
		 * {@code validate} over the curated seed: an order whose concept is {@code Naproxen} mapped to
		 * {@code M01AE02} and whose free text reads {@code Warfarin 5mg} yields "Ibuprofen is in the
		 * same ATC class (M01AE) as active order Warfarin 5mg", and warfarin is {@code B01AA03}. That
		 * is issue #161's shape, which ADR Decision 38 already accepts for a partly-covered NAMELESS
		 * order and which now also reaches a NAMED one. Not closable here for the reason that decision
		 * gives: the branch is entered because no code resolved an entry, so asking whether the display
		 * and the codes name one substance is undecidable on it — and refusing the display would put
		 * back the bare code this ladder exists to replace. Pinned AS WRONG by
		 * {@code NonCodedDrugOrderNameTest.aClassChipCanNameAnOrderAfterTextTheCitedSubgroupDoesNotClassify},
		 * so a change that closes it reddens a test rather than leaving this paragraph the only record.
		 * The rule sentence of a FOLDED chip does not have this fault — {@link #namesNamingOrder}
		 * validates the display against the rule's own token before it is handed over — which is why
		 * the two sentences are guarded differently.

	 *
	 * <p>{@link DrugSafetyValidator#classRelationships} runs per in-play SUBSTANCE, and it used to call
	 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#orderPartners} each time. That resolution is a function of the pass's
	 * {@code context} and the loaded dataset — both fixed for the pass — so every call after the first
	 * re-derived an answer the pass already had, and a request's cost grew as drugs-in-play TIMES
	 * active orders rather than as the PAIRS the issue blamed. Measured through the real
	 * {@code validate} over the shipped knowledge base with a 43-order chart, five interleaved runs:
	 * 95–130 ms at one drug in play and 482–488 ms at ten, against 96–134 ms and 130–173 ms with this
	 * class in place. A probe wrapping the resolution (one run, not interleaved) attributed 42% of the
	 * one-drug pass and 77% of the ten-drug pass to it. The same questions against a chart with NO
	 * active orders cost 1.2 ms and 30 ms, which bounds everything the chart does not drive — the
	 * pairwise arms the issue blamed included.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Lazy, and that is not an optimisation of an optimisation.</b> A question that puts no
	 * substance in play — the commonest one — resolves nothing at all today, because
	 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#classRelationships} is never reached; hoisting the call into
	 * {@code validate} eagerly would make that question pay for a chart nothing asks about. So the pass
	 * carries the ABILITY to resolve and pays on first use.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Two memos, because there are two per-subject sweeps and the first does not reach the
	 * second.</b> {@link #resolved()} holds the partner list; {@link #entryForCode(String)} holds the
	 * code-to-entry resolution that {@link DrugSafetyValidator#orderPartners} needs while building that
	 * list and that {@link DrugSafetyValidator#ruleAbout} needs afterwards, per class hit, from the
	 * arm's own loop. Memoising the list alone would leave {@code ruleAbout} sweeping the dataset per
	 * (subject, partner, code) — measured SMALL, 0, 0, 3 and 5 sweeps at one, two, five and ten drugs
	 * in play against 93 to 433 dataset-walk CALLS in total, over a chart built so that every active order shares a
	 * subgroup with an in-play drug, because that method returns before resolving anything when the
	 * subject has no rule about an active order and that is the ordinary outcome — but real, and a
	 * second copy of the defect this class removes.
	 *
	 * <p><b>A per-call LOCAL and never a field</b> — issue #172's rule, for the reasons
	 * {@link DrugReferenceService}'s class javadoc gives — and which reason applies is asked per memo
	 * rather than reciting both, because they do not both bind. The SINGLETON reason binds each: a
	 * field on this bean would be one unsynchronized structure shared by every concurrent request. The
	 * second binds only {@link #resolved()}, which has no key at all — it is this patient's chart, so a
	 * field would answer for whoever asked first. {@link #entryForCode(String)}'s cache is bounded by
	 * the ATC code space and its values are a function of the loaded dataset rather than of any chart,
	 * so it takes the singleton reason alone.
	 * {@code CoMedicationResolutionPerPassTest} pins the sweep invariant and the chips it must
	 * not move behaviourally, and pins the single construction site structurally — the second because a
	 * field reassigned once per pass sweeps exactly as often as a local does, which is the limit
	 * CLAUDE.md records for the analogous {@code recordedAllergens} memo.
	 *
	 * <p>Sharing ONE partner list across the pass's subjects is sound because nothing downstream
	 * mutates or retains a partner: every write to an {@link OrderPartner} happens inside
	 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#orderPartners} and
	 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#addPartnersForUnmappedOrders} while the list is being built,
	 * {@code OrderPartner} declares no {@code equals}/{@code hashCode}, and the only structure keyed on

		 * SUBSTANCE", which is only the first of the three rungs below and was the whole of this method
		 * until issue #339's review round 2.
		 *
		 * <p>Two of those rungs are substance keys, and the second is what reaches the shape issue #339
		 * opens with. A
		 * partner's {@link OrderPartner#labelEntry} is the substance the ladder NAMED it after, and for

		 * payload ADR Decision 39 records, {@code active order Isoniazid / Rifapentine} beside
		 * {@code active order isoniazid}. {@link OrderPartner#substances} is what the order's own names
		 * imply, populated on exactly that rung, so it reaches the other half.
		 *
		 * <p>{@code labelEntry} keys are laid down FIRST and a {@code substances} key never displaces
		 * one: a partner that IS a substance speaks for it ahead of one that merely contains it, so a
		 * combination order cannot take a chip away from the single-substance order of the same drug.
		 *
		 * <p><b>And on a THIRD thing, which is not a substance at all</b> (issue #339, review round 2):
		 * the co-medication this pass attributed a CHART-recorded ATC code that {@code entry} also
		 * publishes to ({@link #partnerSharingAChartedCode}). The two sets this method bridges are not
		 * the same set and were never meant to be. {@link SubjectRule#partner} is
		 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#activeOrderEntryFor}'s answer over
		 * {@link DrugReferenceService#findForActiveOrders} — ATC ∪ NAME, additive on purpose — while
		 * the partners here come from {@link DrugSafetyValidator#orderPartners}, which walks the chart's
		 * codes and then resolves the orders no code reached BY NAME. So ONE prescription can resolve to
		 * two reference substances, only one of which a partner is keyed on: the shipped knowledge base
		 * files {@code Ketoconazole} and {@code Levoketoconazole} as two substances (two
		 * {@code drugbank_id}s) publishing one {@code rxnorm_name} and one identical ATC list, and a
		 * chart carrying a single mapped {@code Ketoconazole} order resolves both. Without this rung the
		 * rule whose partner is the second entry keeps {@link DrugSafetyValidator#partnerLabel} beside a
		 * chip about that same prescription which reconciled — {@code Abacavir interacts with active
		 * order Ketoconazole} next to {@code Ketoconazole interacts with active order ketoconazole},
		 * which is exactly the shape issue #339 exists to remove and which the widening to every rule
		 * chip introduced. Measured through the real {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate} over the
		 * shipped KB: of its 2114 substances, 84 put a SECOND substance into
		 * {@code findForActiveOrders} for a one-order chart, and sweeping every one of those against up
		 * to three counterpart drugs (216 responses) the rung removes 6 divergent responses and adds
		 * none, taking the responses in which two different {@code active order} labels differ only in
		 * CASE from 6 to 0 — 7 with the reconciliation disabled altogether, so it also closes one the
		 * pre-#339 code had.
		 *
		 * <p>Answering null is not a failure and is the ordinary outcome for an uncovered order — the
		 * caller then keeps {@link #partnerLabel}, which is what every rule chip printed before this.
		 *
		 * <p><b>It CAN hand back a partner the rule is not about, and the caller's gate is what refuses
		 * — do not read a bound into this method that it does not hold.</b> An earlier form of this
		 * javadoc claimed the opposite "by construction", on the premise that
		 * {@link OrderPartner#substances} is populated only on the branch that also calls
		 * {@link OrderPartner#nameByOrder}, so the order gate would apply. That premise is false and the
		 * comment at the write site says so in the opposite direction: since issues #290/#292 the two
		 * are on one branch but no longer under one condition — {@code nameByOrder} withholds the rename
		 * for a synthesized or blank display ({@link DrugSafetyValidator#displayNamesADrug}) while the
		 * {@code substances} leg runs for every carrier — so a partner can hold a null
		 * {@link OrderPartner#namingOrder}, a non-null {@link OrderPartner#labelEntry} and a
		 * {@code substances} set naming a different substance, and {@code reconciledPartnerName} then
		 * takes the ENTRY rung, where {@link DrugSafetyValidator#namesNamingOrder} never runs. The third
		 * rung above widens it much further still, deliberately: an ATC correlation is not identity, and
		 * {@link DrugReference#substanceKey()} exists because this knowledge base publishes one
		 * {@code A02BC05} for {@code Omeprazole} and {@code Esomeprazole} alike.
		 *
		 * <p>What actually refuses is {@link DrugSafetyValidator#unambiguouslyNames}, asked of the row
		 * about to be PRINTED: the rule's token must name that row and outrank every rival claimant, so
		 * the {@code Omeprazole}/{@code Esomeprazole} pair is refused on the ranking rather than on the
		 * lookup, and the caller keeps its own token. That is why widening the lookup cannot open a
		 * mis-attribution class — it can only turn a chip that printed the token into one the gate is
		 * asked about. Mutate that gate and read the failures rather than trusting this — and say WHICH
		 * mutation, because the gate has two halves, they answer differently, and a THIRD mutation a
		 * reader reaches for is neither of them. All three re-measured at issue #339's review round 10
		 * head. Short-circuit {@code unambiguouslyNames} itself so that it always permits, and
		 * {@code FoldedChipOnePartnerNameTest.aRuleAboutAnotherSubstanceSharingTheCodeKeepsItsOwnToken}
		 * — the one about a token whose two claimants share an ATC code, which is the correlation this
		 * rung makes — is among the failures. Replace only the RANKING half, the
		 * {@link DrugReferenceService#uniqueStrongestClaimant} CALL inside that method, and that case is
		 * NOT: its token does not name the ladder's entry at all, so it is refused by the identity half
		 * ({@link #namesEntry}) and a ranking mutation cannot reach it. That MEMBERSHIP is the whole of
		 * what separates the two halves, and it is what to read for. Short-circuiting
		 * {@code uniqueStrongestClaimant} ITSELF is the third mutation and not the second: that method
		 * has a second caller in {@link DrugReferenceService#findNamedSubstances} (the recorded-allergen
		 * path), so it also reddens {@code RecordedAllergenChipNameTest} and
		 * {@code InjectedContraindicationCorroborationTest}, which say nothing about this rung. <b>No
		 * case counts are published for any of the three</b> — the count for the first was wrong in this

		 * not name, which is how review round 10 came to check a different one. Name the mutation and

	 * <p>Grouping by the order OUTRIGHT would have been wrong in both directions, which is why the
	 * order is consulted only for the codes the dataset cannot speak for. What the order NAMES is a
	 * different question (issue #185) but is read on that same rung and under that same condition —
	 * see {@link OrderPartner#substances}. It would split a substance
	 * the patient holds TWO orders of into two partners, which this ladder deliberately merges; and
	 * it would merge a fixed-dose COMBINATION — one order whose concept maps to the codes of two
	 * different substances — into one, dropping a real duplicate-therapy chip. A combination is
	 * exactly the case {@link #soleSubstanceOf} answers null for, so its uncovered codes stay on the
	 * order rung: with two substances in one tablet there is no evidence which of them an uncovered
	 * code belongs to, and the order is the honest answer.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The ladder is only reached by an order the dictionary CLASSIFIED</b>, which is the whole of
	 * what issue #228 added and is a leg rather than a rung: it is walked per CODE, so an order mapped to
	 * no code entered nowhere on it and the arm was blind to that prescription entirely. Such orders are
	 * resolved afterwards, by name, in {@link #addPartnersForUnmappedOrders} — which is where the
	 * scoping, the naming and the deliberate asymmetry with this loop are recorded. Nothing here changes:
	 * an order this loop walks is grouped, named and skipped exactly as before.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Where the ladder did not hold its promise, and why it now does.</b> A nameless order used
	 * to reach {@link PatientClinicalContext#getActiveDrugAtcCodes()} without reaching
	 * {@code getActiveDrugOrders()}, so {@link #orderCarrying} found nothing and each of its uncovered
	 * codes was its own partner — one prescription, one chip per code. Issue #290 closed it where this
	 * javadoc said it had to be closed: {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder} gives such an order a
	 * code-only fallback display so it reaches the list, and the grouping here then keys on the ORDER.
	 * For a SINGLE order the grouping needed nothing on this side — the issue #186 rung already keys on
	 * the order. Admitting an order with no name added a second hazard that is not about naming at all:
	 * where two orders carry one dataset-unnameable code, {@link #orderCarrying}'s answer becomes this
	 * loop's {@code identity}, so preferring a carrier that can name itself decides which order the
	 * partner is KEYED on as well as what it is called — without it this change's own test observes TWO
	 * partners for one prescription. The naming needed one thing beside that: a display that is not a
	 * name is withheld from {@link OrderPartner#nameByOrder}.
	 *
	 * <p>What remains is a context built from the flattened sets alone (issue #118), where there is no
	 * order identity to group BY and grouping every unclaimed code together would merge the whole
	 * medication list into one partner. That residue is deliberate.
	 *
	 * <p>What the fallback does NOT do is rename anything the dataset could name: the code-only display
	 * labels a partner only where no entry resolved (the else branch below), and it is withheld from
	 * {@link OrderPartner#nameByOrder}, so it can never replace a dataset name on a partly-covered
	 * order. What that costs is stated on the guard itself — where the shared class was matched through
	 * the unnameable code alone, the covered constituent's name stays, which is issue #161's shape.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What each partner is known to CONTAIN is a separate answer</b> (issue #185), collected on
	 * the same rung the ladder takes the order's NAME from:
	 * {@link OrderPartner#substances} holds what the order's own recorded names imply
	 * ({@link #substancesNamedBy}), added on the same BRANCH as {@link OrderPartner#nameByOrder} — but
	 * since issue #290 no longer under the same condition: the substances leg runs for every carrier,
	 * while the naming leg is withheld when the order's display is synthesized OR blank — since issue #292 both, through {@link #displayNamesADrug}, which is why one unfolded class-only chip's text moves in that change.
	 * The two answers are deliberately not the same thing: the ladder picks ONE identity so the
	 * clinician sees one partner named one way, while the skip that reads this has to know about
	 * every substance in the tablet.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The label follows the same ladder</b> (issue #155). It used to be the entry's label or,
	 * failing that, the bare CODE — so on {@code sourceFormat=json}, then the default, whose four-entry
	 * curated seed carries no aspirin, Agnes Adams' chip read "… as active order N02BA01". A clinician
	 * has no reason to recognise an ATC code, and the order it stands for carries a display name that
	 * needs no reference dataset at all. The code survives only as the last resort, where nothing in
	 * the context names the order either.
	 *
	 * <p>Grouped once per SUBJECT and carried through that subject's sentence and its fold, so the
	 * partner a chip names and the partner {@link #addInteractionWarnings} decides about cannot be
	 * different ones. <b>And now once per {@code validate} as well</b> (issue #256): call this only
	 * through {@link CoMedications}, which is the pass's one resolution and the only caller —
	 * {@link #classRelationships} used to call it per in-play substance, so a request's cost grew as
	 * drugs-in-play TIMES active orders. The resolution this method returns, and the code cache it is
	 * handed, both live on that class as LOCALS threaded through the pass and never fields (issue
	 * #172's rule, for the reasons {@link DrugReferenceService}'s class javadoc gives; not the
	 * {@code getAll()} reload this used to cite, of which there is none). {@link #ruleAbout} reads the
	 * same code cache through that class rather than re-running the sweep for itself.
	 *
	 * <p>Issue #185 added a name resolution to this loop, bounded rather than paid for everywhere:
	 * {@link #substanceRowsNamedBy} runs only for a code the dataset cannot name, and is memoised per
	 * order. Timed interleaved against the pre-change code over the shipped 19 MB KB with
	 * a 30-order, 60-name context, the two were indistinguishable within this machine's run-to-run
	 * spread — which is the reason no figure is quoted here. Issue #256 is the larger order count that
	 * sentence asked to be measured at, and it built the per-pass memo: see {@link CoMedications}.
	 *
	 * <p>Issue #228 gave that resolution a second caller, and it is the one that raises the bound:
	 * {@link #addPartnersForUnmappedOrders} asks it once per DICTIONARY-UNMAPPED order rather than once
	 * per unnameable code, through the same memo, so the work is one dataset sweep per NAME of each
	 * such order — on the 3.7.1 standalone, 27 of 43 orders' worth of names. That is work the
	 * pre-change code did not do at all for an order carrying no codes. It is paid once per
	 * {@code validate} PASS since issue #256, and was once per in-play SUBSTANCE until then; the pass
	 * itself still runs twice per query (pre-answer through
	 * {@link DrugReferenceInjector#preAnswerFindings}, post-answer through {@code LlmInferenceService}),
	 * so a query pays it twice. What that per-order memo cannot save is a name REPEATED across orders,
	 * which is a separate cache and is threaded as one. And because this method now runs once per pass,
	 * "per call" and "per pass" are the same scope for the three memos below.

	 * fixed one layer over, where the injector decided an order's relevance from the ENTRY's codes and
	 * its membership from the ORDER's.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Which orders</b>: the complement of what the loop walked, computed from what it walked rather
	 * than from a proxy for it — an order none of whose codes is in the set above contributed no code to
	 * it and so produced no partner there. That is every order the dictionary mapped to nothing, and also
	 * the shape a context assembled from an order list and a narrower flattened set can hold. An order

	 * screens and the injector has taken since issue #151 — resolves its own name leg with. Per ORDER
	 * here rather than over the flattened name set that method walks, because a co-medication has to be
	 * attributable to the prescription it IS; in production the two are the same names, since
	 * {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder} assembles that union out of these very per-order sets. So
	 * the substances this leg can reach are the name half of {@code findForActiveOrders}'s own answer,
	 * and the chip layer cannot come to disagree with the prompt about which prescriptions the reference
	 * data covers — which is the direction the disagreement ran before #151, the injector's answer
	 * always the smaller.
	 *
	 * <p>Never the unranked matcher underneath it: that admits a strict superset, and here the surplus
	 * becomes a co-medication of its own. Issue #209's case is a real unmapped order on this instance —
	 * Sarah Taylor's {@code Hydrocortisone Injection vial 100mg} — and reaches
	 * {@code Hydrocortisone butyrate} unranked, so one prescription would be reported as two, the second
	 * of them an ester she is not on. Both halves are asserted over the verbatim KB slice by
	 * {@code UnmappedOrderClassPartnerTest}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Named and classified by the dataset, both.</b> The name is the entry's — issue #155's ladder
	 * taken at its first rung, since the dataset HAS a name for this substance — so the chip reads the
	 * same "as active order Dexamethasone" whether or not a dictionary classified the concept, which is
	 * the property this fix is for. The codes are that same row's, for the same reason and because there
	 * is no alternative: the order published none, so what the reference data files the substance under
	 * is the only classification there is — <b>except for the one thing the order CAN say about itself,
	 * which is where the drug is applied</b>. Since issue #234 those codes pass through
	 * {@link DrugReference#codesForRecordedAdministration} first, so a substance marketed by several
	 * routes is compared on the presentation the chart records rather than on all of them. Where the
	 * chart records nothing this module can attribute to a site, the sentence above stands unchanged.
	 *
	 * <p><b>WHICH row of the substance</b> is {@link #interactionSubject}, not the bare fold. A partner
	 * reached from an ATC CODE has no recorded name to prefer, which is why {@link #entryForAtcCode}
	 * answers with {@link DrugReference#canonicalRow} alone (issue #174 site 1); a partner reached from
	 * an order's NAME does, and issue #194 measured what the fold alone then costs — on this very corpus,
	 * a {@code Botulinum toxin type A} order named after {@code Daxibotulinumtoxina}, because both rows
	 * of that substance name no route and the other is the dataset's first. So the chart decides first
	 * and the fold decides the rows tied there, the order issue #187 settled. Re-measured 2026-08-13 by
	 * calling both through the built code over the 19 MB KB, on every (unmapped order, substance) pair
	 * the standalone's own order list resolves — 28 of them: they agree on 27 and differ on that one.
	 *
	 * <p>ONE row and not the group, which is the same choice {@link #entryForAtcCode} makes for this arm
	 * and is lossless on the same DATA invariant recorded at {@link #addInteractionWarnings}: every row
	 * of a substance in the shipped KB publishes the same ATC list. What does NOT rest on that invariant
	 * is the self-skip, which is held explicitly — see {@link OrderPartner#substances}.
	 *
	 * <p>That invariant is also what keeps this loop's answer independent of the sequence
	 * {@code OrderService} returned the prescriptions in. Two orders of one substance recorded under
	 * different row names rank different rows, and the FIRST such order names the partner — a
	 * presentation choice, the same one {@link #orderCarrying} makes on the code rung. It selects a row
	 * rather than a code set only while the rows agree about their codes; where they would not, which
	 * order came back first could decide whether a chip fires at all.
	 *
	 * <p>The codes being the DATASET's is an ASYMMETRY with the loop above, and it runs BOTH ways. A
	 * partner the dictionary mapped is compared on the codes the DICTIONARY published for it, which can
	 * be a proper subset of the substance's, while a partner reached here is compared on every code the
	 * dataset files it under.
	 * <ul>
	 *   <li>So a partly-mapped order can be blind to a subgroup an unmapped one would see. Widening the
	 *       first to match would change chips this issue is not about, and is left open deliberately.</li>
	 *   <li>And an unmapped order can be named in a chip stating a class its own PRESENTATION does not
	 *       belong to — an unmapped {@code Hydrocortisone cream 1%} is classified by every code the
	 *       hydrocortisone row carries, {@link #sharedClass} prefers the systemic one, and the chip says
	 *       {@code H02AB} where the same order mapped to {@code D07AA02} alone would say nothing. This
	 *       is the over-claiming direction, and it is the one a clinician sees.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <b>The second of those is issue #234 and is now closed; the first is not.</b> The route WAS
	 * unavailable to this arm — {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder} read a {@code DrugOrder}'s names
	 * and its concept's ATC mappings and nothing else — and it is now carried, per order, as
	 * {@link PatientClinicalContext.ActiveDrugOrder#getAdministrationTerms()}: every name the order's
	 * route concept publishes and every name its drug's dosage-form concept publishes — not the one
	 * {@code Concept.getName()} elects, which is the locale-PREFERRED spelling and hides the formal one
	 * this module's vocabulary is written in for three of the reference dictionary's own routes. So the
	 * codes this leg loads into the partner go through {@link DrugReference#codesForRecordedAdministration} first, which keeps the
	 * ones classifying a presentation given where the chart says the drug is applied.
	 *
	 * <p>It closes the OVER-claiming direction only, and only where the chart says something this
	 * module can attribute: a term naming no site, and a substance the dataset files under no code at
	 * that site, both leave these codes exactly as they were. Measured on the 3.7.1 demo instance
	 * 2026-08-28, that is all 46 of its active drug orders — 32 recording "Oral administration" and 14
	 * recording nothing — so the narrowing is inert on every corpus this repo can drive and the first
	 * bullet's own case is untouched. The under-claiming direction above is still deliberately open:
	 * widening a partly-mapped order to the dataset's codes would change chips neither issue is about.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Appended after the code walk</b>, so every chip this arm already raised keeps its position and
	 * a newly-reachable co-medication sorts after the ones a dictionary classified. A substance the walk
	 * already reached is skipped outright: two orders of one substance are ONE co-medication (issue #186)
	 * whether they resolved by code or by name, and the partner that exists already carries the
	 * dictionary's own attribution. "Already reached" is {@link #alreadyACoMedication} and not a map
	 * lookup, because the walk keys some partners on the ORDER rather than on a substance.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The bound this leaves at the cross-arm fold.</b> {@link #ruleAbout} correlates a partner to a
	 * rule through {@link #entryForAtcCode}, which answers with the CANONICAL row publishing a code — and
	 * a level-5 code can be published by two substances in this KB ({@code Omeprazole} and
	 * {@code Esomeprazole} share {@code A02BC05}; see {@link #classRelationships}). A partner reached
	 * here carries the reference row's codes rather than an order's, so where the patient is ALSO on a
	 * dictionary-mapped order of the other substance, both partners hold that one code and the fold can
	 * attach this one's sentence to the other one's rule chip — or drop it, which is what
	 * {@link #addInteractionWarnings}'s second-partner branch already does with two partners of one
	 * rule. Both sentences are true and the chip's own subject is unaffected; what is lost is which
	 * co-medication the second sentence is about. Left standing rather than given machinery: it needs
	 * that shared-code pair AND both substances prescribed AND a rated rule, and correlating on the
	 * partner's SUBSTANCE instead is a change to issue #88's fold rather than to this leg.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Since issue #292 that fold depends on this paragraph</b>, and since issue #297 so does the
	 * injected {@code drug_reference} note, which takes the fold's answer in its own vocabulary — so
	 * closing the bound here is no longer a local change, and it now reaches PROMPT text:
	 * {@link #reconciledPartnerName}'s second refusal cites exactly this reasoning
	 * for why it will not let the class arm's label displace a rule's own token, and
	 * {@code FoldedChipOnePartnerNameTest.aRuleAboutAnotherSubstanceSharingTheCodeKeepsItsOwnToken}
	 * pins the behaviour that follows from it. Read that method before narrowing this.

	 *         <p><b>Asked of the SUBSTANCE, over every unmapped order that names it, and not of the one
	 *         order that happened to reach it first.</b> That is the whole reason this is a method. The
	 *         partner is keyed on {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()}, so two orders of one
	 *         substance are ONE co-medication (issue #186) and {@link #alreadyACoMedication} skips the
	 *         second before its terms are ever read — which made the FIRST order in {@code OrderService}
	 *         list order decide the classification for both. Measured through the real {@code validate}
	 *         over {@code ddi-contra-route-variants.json}, a patient on an unmapped
	 *         {@code Hydrocortisone cream 1%} recorded {@code Topical} AND an unmapped
	 *         {@code Hydrocortisone 20mg tablet} recorded {@code Oral administration}, asked about
	 *         dexamethasone: cream first raised nothing, tablet first raised the {@code H02AB} chip. The
	 *         patient is on systemic hydrocortisone in both. A suppression that depends on the sequence
	 *         the prescriptions came back in is the hazard {@code CLAUDE.md} records for
	 *         {@link OrderPartner#substances} and {@link #ordersCarrying}, reached here by another road.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>One presentation this module cannot express declines for the whole substance</b>,
	 *         rather than the union of the sites the others name. The orders are presentations of ONE
	 *         drug the patient is on, so an order it cannot place is a presentation it cannot rule out —
	 *         and the substance's own classification is then the only honest answer, which is the same
	 *         reading {@link DrugReference#codesForRecordedAdministration} takes for a single order that
	 *         names no site. Failing the other way would let a topical cream silence the tablet beside
	 *         it.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>"Cannot express" and not "names no site"</b>, which is
	 *         {@link DrugReference#narrowsAnyCode}'s own distinction and a defect that stood between two
	 *         passes of this change: an order the module places at a site the dataset files no code for
	 *         passes the weaker test, and its decline then rests on a fallback evaluated over the UNION
	 *         of every order's terms — which a sibling that does narrow rescues, taking the first
	 *         order's codes with it.
	 *
	 *         <p>Scoped to the orders THIS leg governs — dictionary-unmapped, through the same
	 *         {@link #governedByTheNameLeg} the caller applies. <b>Nothing in the suite pins that
	 *         conjunct</b>: removing it left the whole api build green, so a reader must not delete it
	 *         expecting a test to object. It is kept because the cover it duplicates is not total. In
	 *         the ordinary case an order the code walk reached produced a partner of its own and
	 *         {@link #alreadyACoMedication} keeps this leg away from that substance entirely — through
	 *         its second half, {@link OrderPartner#substances}, wherever the dataset could name none of
	 *         that order's codes. Where the dataset CAN name them the partner is keyed on the substance
	 *         the dataset names the CODE, that field is not filled, and this leg asks a different
	 *         question: what the order's NAME implies. A substance the name implies and the code does
	 *         not name is therefore invisible to {@link #alreadyACoMedication} and can be given a
	 *         partner here through an unmapped sibling order, at which point this loop would reach the
	 *         mapped order too. Whether the shipped data holds such a pair is not measured; the
	 *         conjunct makes it moot, by keeping a dictionary-mapped prescription's recorded
	 *         administration out of a substance this leg owns.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>What the re-walk costs, measured rather than argued.</b> The WALK is quadratic in
	 *         the orders this leg governs — a {@link Collections#disjoint} and a map lookup per pair —
	 *         but the two expensive halves are not: the {@code containsKey} conjunct admits only the
	 *         orders naming THIS substance, so the site walk is linear, and no name is resolved twice.
	 *         {@code cache} is one memo for the whole {@link #orderPartners} call and the caller's own
	 *         loop shares it, so each governed order's names are resolved once across the whole of
	 *         {@link #addPartnersForUnmappedOrders}, by whichever of the two walks reaches it first.
	 *         Nothing is said here about WHICH walk that is: this one returns early on a decline, so it
	 *         may resolve none, and the property that matters does not depend on the answer. Counted through the real {@code validate} over the shipped KB: 27
	 *         orders give 486 inner iterations against 27 site walks, and 320 give 67550 against 315.
	 *         Timed the same way against a build with the narrowing removed altogether — 3 rounds of 20
	 *         reps at 10, 80 and 320 orders — the two are indistinguishable within this machine's
	 *         run-to-run spread, which is why no short-circuit is built here. Re-measure that way, and
	 *         note that no TIME figure is quoted for the same reason {@link #orderPartners} quotes none.

	 *         that claim at all.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The defect this exists to fix (issue #161).</b> This returned the first shared subgroup in
	 * the allergen's own ATC array. Every array in the shipped 19 MB KB is in ascending code order
	 * (measured 2026-08-06: 1839 of the 1839 entries carrying codes), so "first" meant "alphabetically
	 * smallest" — and ATC's alphabet front-loads the locally-applied groups: A01 stomatological, C05A
	 * topical, D dermatological all sort ahead of H, J, L, M and N. A substance marketed by several
	 * routes carries a code for each, so the chip systematically justified a systemic concern with a
	 * topical class. Reported live against a dexamethasone allergy (issue #161): methylprednisolone as
	 * {@code D10AA} (anti-acne preparations), an injected hydrocortisone as {@code A01AC}
	 * (corticosteroids for local ORAL treatment) — both reproduced in-process from the same KB rows by
	 * {@code CrossReactivityClassChoiceTest}, while prednisone, whose only shared subgroup IS
	 * {@code H02AB}, was right in the same answer. The finding was right and its stated reason was
	 * not, which is the failure a clinician checks and then stops trusting.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Why prefer the systemic class rather than match the order's route.</b> The route is not
	 * available HERE, and the half of that which is about this seam is unchanged by issue #234: this
	 * arm runs both for a drug the QUESTION names, which has no route at all, and for one the patient
	 * is on ({@link #addActiveOrderContraindications}) — and even there it receives a resolved
	 * {@link DrugReference}, not the order. So a route-matching rule could only ever bind one of the
	 * two call sites, and the question-driven half would still be choosing by some other rule. That is
	 * why the preference stays exactly as it is.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What issue #234 changed, and what it did not.</b> The premise that "nothing carries the
	 * route that far" is no longer true of the context: {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder} now reads
	 * a {@code DrugOrder}'s route concept and its drug's dosage-form concept, and
	 * {@link PatientClinicalContext.ActiveDrugOrder#getAdministrationTerms()} carries them. It is used
	 * at ONE site — {@link #addPartnersForUnmappedOrders}, where a partner reached by NAME holds the
	 * dataset's codes for a whole substance and the chart can say which presentation of it the patient
	 * has. It is deliberately NOT used here. This method compares two code sets and is handed them by
	 * four callers; the narrowing belongs where an order is turned into codes, not where codes are
	 * compared, or the same evidence would be applied twice and once out of reach of the order it came
	 * from.
	 *
	 * <p><b>WHICH PAIRS THE FIGURES BELOW COUNT (issue #243).</b> Two PAIR bases — the CLAIM base named
	 * in the paragraph below headed "But the two arms CAN now name different classes" is a third thing,
	 * counting what {@link #validate} emits rather than what the KB relates — and every figure here
	 * says which of the two it is over, because the same question over the same KB answers 1090 on one
	 * and 319 on the other. A count that does not say is ambiguous in exactly the dimension this code
	 * path keeps getting wrong (#145, #162, #163, #174, #185, #186). A ROW PAIR is an unordered pair of
	 * the entries {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource#parse} loads; a SUBSTANCE PAIR is an unordered pair of
	 * the {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()} families those entries fall into, each represented
	 * by its {@link DrugReference#canonicalRow}. The row base counts a substance pair once per
	 * combination of their rows, and counts in addition the pairs that are two rows of ONE substance,
	 * which have no substance-pair counterpart at all — so over the shipped KB (2283 rows, 2114
	 * substances) 7783 row pairs share at least one level-4 subgroup against 5550 substance pairs, and
	 * 1090 against 319 share more than one, 128 of that 1090 being two rows of one substance. A chip
	 * names a substance, so the substance base is the one that counts what a clinician can see; the row
	 * figures are kept because they are what the decisions recorded here were taken on. What makes a
	 * substance's subgroups well-defined at all is the DATA invariant recorded at
	 * {@link #addInteractionWarnings} — every row of a substance in that KB publishes the same ATC
	 * list — which owns its own count and its own instruction to re-measure it on a KB refresh.
	 *
	 * <p>Every count in the paragraph above and in those that follow down to and including the issue
	 * #168 one, save the superseded 87 that issue #168 was itself filed against, was measured
	 * 2026-08-14 for issue #243 over the shipped KB by driving {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource#parse} for
	 * the load, {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()} and {@link DrugReference#canonicalRow} for
	 * the substance base, {@link DrugReference#atcSubgroups()} for the intersections,
	 * {@link DrugReference#isLocallyAppliedAtcCode}, {@link DrugReference#isUnclassifyingAtcCode} and
	 * {@link DrugReference#isPurposeOnlyAtcCode} for the tiers, and — where the text says so —
	 * {@link #validate} itself. Re-measure before relying on one.
	 *
	 * <p><b>And why not report the shared level-3 group instead</b>, which the issue offers as the
	 * answer that is coarser but never false: of the 1090 ROW pairs that share more than one level-4
	 * subgroup, <b>1041 still share more than one level-3 group</b> — 309 of the 319 substance pairs.
	 * Dexamethasone and hydrocortisone share six subgroups spanning six different level-3 groups, so
	 * the collapse removes the chemical subgroup — the part that carries the cross-reactivity claim —
	 * without removing the choice it was supposed to settle.
	 *
	 * <p><b>A preference, never a filter.</b> Counting the locally-applied preference on its own, which
	 * is what it was introduced as — the claim filters described below sit in front of it and are
	 * measured on their own lists — the 1090 ROW pairs partition into 263 whose class this changes, 587
	 * that share no systemic subgroup at all — two topical azoles, two ophthalmic preparations, two
	 * local anaesthetic formulations, for which the locally-applied class IS the honest answer and is
	 * kept — and 240 that were already naming a systemic one; over substance pairs those three are 62,
	 * 165 and 92 in that order, so the 587 is 165. A filter rather than a preference would have to drop
	 * or fabricate a class for the 587, the largest of the three groups.
	 *
	 * <p><b>And why the tie inside the systemic tier is still broken alphabetically (issue #168).</b>
	 * On the same count 70 row pairs — 21 substance pairs — leave the systemic tier holding more than
	 * one candidate; once each arm has refused what its claim does not license that is 69 row / 20
	 * substance pairs for duplicate therapy and 64 / 16 for cross-reactivity, whose stronger
	 * requirement removes four more of the substance pairs and five more of the row ones (issue #168
	 * was filed against a pre-correction count of 87). The 16 are a subset of the 20, so those are 20
	 * distinct pairs; driving {@link #validate} over all 36 pair-and-arm combinations of them, every
	 * one names the alphabetically smallest surviving candidate and none fails to raise a class chip,
	 * so the tie-break really is what decides them.
	 * What ATC's own words support does not break those ties. Three of the 20 hold candidates whose
	 * published names are IDENTICAL — {@code G03AC}/{@code L02AB} "Progestogens",
	 * {@code N01AF}/{@code N05CA} "Barbiturates, plain", {@code L01EG}/{@code L04AH} "Mammalian target
	 * of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase inhibitors" — so for those there is no aptness to rank, only a code.
	 * For the rest, the two ranks this module already derives from those names move almost nothing:
	 * preferring the candidate that asserts more ({@link DrugReference#isPurposeOnlyAtcCode}) moves one
	 * of the 20, {@code Calcium chloride} against {@code Ammonium chloride}, from {@code B05XA}
	 * "Electrolyte solutions" to {@code G04BA} "Acidifiers", and none of the 16; preferring a subgroup
	 * whose own published name does not begin "Other"/"Various" — the name test issue #182's first
	 * family applies as one conjunct rather than as a rule of its own — moves none of either. Neither
	 * reaches issue #168's own example, because {@code H02CA} "Anticorticosteroids" and {@code J02AB}
	 * "Imidazole derivatives" sit in the same tier of both — the first names a target and the second a
	 * structural family, and issue #183 read every level-4 name in the WHO ATC index and put target and
	 * structure on the same side of its one hard line deliberately. A rule preferring {@code J02AB}
	 * would therefore be a new distinction drawn inside a tier and hand-picked from the reported case:
	 * the unmeasured preference issue #161 refused, and the shape whose hardening found issue #161's
	 * own list reproducing the defect it was fixing. Both candidates are true of the pair, so this is a
	 * choice between honest answers and not the defect above.
	 *
	 * <p>Sorted rather than in the allergen's array order so the result is a function of the two code
	 * SETS and not of the position a dataset happened to write a code in — what keeps a KB refresh that
	 * reorders an array from silently rewording a chip. A no-op on the shipped KB, whose arrays are all
	 * ascending, so the case that pins it
	 * ({@code CrossReactivityClassChoiceTest.theAnswerDoesNotDependOnTheAllergenArraysCodeOrder}) is
	 * the one fixture here that deviates from verbatim, by writing one allergen's array descending.
	 *
	 * <p><b>And the subgroups no tier may return</b> (issue #167): a shared subgroup that classifies
	 * neither the substance nor a therapy is skipped outright rather than demoted, in both tiers, so
	 * the method can answer "they share nothing that explains anything" — see
	 * {@link DrugReference#isUnclassifyingAtcCode}. A demotion would not do: potassium iodide and
	 * acetylcysteine share {@code S01XA} "Other ophthalmologicals" AND {@code V03AB} "Antidotes", one
	 * locally applied and one not, so every tier a demotion could fall through to is occupied by
	 * another bucket that means nothing either. The caller then decides what "no shared class" implies:
	 * both arms fall through to the curated cross-reactivity groups, which is the one class statement
	 * this module makes from data a clinician curated rather than from a code.
	 *
	 * <p><b>And how strong an assertion each ARM needs</b> (issues #183/#184). {@code crossReactivity}
	 * decides only that, and nothing else: the preference between the surviving candidates — systemic
	 * over locally applied, and sorted so the answer is a function of the two code SETS — is the same
	 * either way and stays here, in one method, which is what issue #171 asked for and is why the arm
	 * is a parameter rather than a second scan.
	 *
	 * <p><b>But the two arms CAN now name different classes for one pair, and that is not #171
	 * returning.</b> #171 was two independent scans that could disagree about which of the same
	 * candidates to prefer. Here the preference is identical and the CANDIDATE SETS differ, because
	 * the arms are making different claims: where a pair shares a purpose-named subgroup and a
	 * chemically named one, "duplicate therapy" is honestly about the first and "cross-reactivity"
	 * honestly about the second, so naming them alike would make one of the two sentences false.
	 * Measured over the shipped KB by calling THIS METHOD both ways on each of the 5550 substance
	 * pairs it relates — a pair base, not the claim base the two lists' own figures use, which counts
	 * what {@code validate} emits and so differs by the handful of claims a question's extra
	 * resolutions add (2026-08-13; re-measure before relying on a figure): 3693 pairs get an answer on
	 * both arms and 4 of them differ — {@code A01AB} against {@code D01AC}/{@code G01AF} for the
	 * imidazoles, {@code B05XA} against {@code G04BA}. Both chips are reachable in one response for a
	 * patient allergic to a drug they are also on; both take the drug being CHECKED as their subject,
	 * so this is the two in-play joins disagreeing, not the order-driven arm.
	 *
	 * <p>A subgroup may justify a claim only as strong as what its own published name asserts. Naming
	 * a purpose is enough to say two drugs duplicate one another and is not enough to say they
	 * cross-react, so the cross-reactivity arm requires a subgroup that
	 * {@link DrugReference#isPurposeOnlyAtcCode} does not recognise and the duplicate-therapy arm only
	 * the weaker {@link DrugReference#isUnclassifyingAtcCode}. Refusing a subgroup does not drop the
	 * claim: the scan continues, so a pair sharing both a purpose-headed and a chemically named
	 * subgroup keeps its cross-reactivity claim under the second — which is why this narrowing costs
	 * only the pairs that share nothing better. The impact of each list is measured on the list
	 * itself.
	 *
	 * <p>{@code otherSubgroups} must be level-4 SUBGROUPS, not full codes — everything here is compared
	 * against {@code refClasses}, which holds subgroups, so a full code would silently match nothing
	 * and the method would report no relationship rather than fail. Both entries satisfy that
	 * differently and neither may stop doing so: {@link #sharedTherapyClass}'s callers reduce first
	 * through {@link DrugReference#atcSubgroups(Set)}, while {@link #sharedCrossReactivityClass}
	 * reduces internally off the entry it is handed.

	 * once per row of {@code inPlay}, so a substance filed as several rows produced one dose warning
	 * per row for a single stated dose, each named after its own row — and, since issue #110, one
	 * near-identical citable safety-finding record per warning in the prompt as well. No bundled

	 * does not set. An operator authoring a file with both — which
	 * {@link DrugReference#getSubstanceName()} explicitly permits — reaches it immediately, so it is
	 * guarded while the pattern is being swept rather than waited for.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Every row is still tried, and that is the point of the shape.</b> A collapse that
	 * simply read the canonical row would DROP a warning whenever the band sits on a sibling — the
	 * one direction a non-blocking advisory must never take. So the SUBJECT row is tried first and the
	 * rest after it, and the first warning found is the one raised — which keeps the quoted band the
	 * named row's own wherever that row's own ceiling is the one exceeded. (Subject-first, not
	 * canonical-first: this paragraph predates issue #206, which made every arm name the row the chart
	 * records, and the row tried first has followed that choice ever since — including through issue
	 * #238, which moved the subject to the row the QUESTION and the patient's own orders name and so
	 * moved the ceiling quoted with it. Over a fixture publishing 3000 mg/day for a route-qualified row
	 * and 2000 for its unqualified sibling, a stated 4000 mg/day is reported against the named row's own
	 * 3000 where it used to be reported against the answer-widened subject's 2000. That is this ordering
	 * working rather than a regression — the alternative leaves the dose arm naming a substance
	 * differently from the other two arms, which is what {@link SubstanceSubjects} exists to prevent —
	 * and it costs no warning, for the reason the next sentence gives. Both directions are pinned by
	 * {@code PerRequestSubstanceSubjectTest}.) What the collapse gives up
	 * is the ability to report two different published ceilings for one substance, which is not a thing
	 * a clinician can act on: nothing here knows which formulation is in play (see
	 * {@link DrugReference#namesNoRoute()}), so a second ceiling is a second guess, not a second
	 * fact.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Issue #208 item 1 — and the quoted ceiling therefore SAYS which row published it.</b> The
	 * two halves above are independent choices (the name is the subject's, the number is the tripping
	 * row's) and where they land on different rows the sentence read as though the number were the
	 * named row's: a patient on {@code Amoxicillin (suspension)}, whose own published ceiling is 2000
	 * mg/day, was told a stated 4000 mg/day exceeded "the 3000 mg/day maximum" — the unqualified
	 * sibling's number. Preferring the subject's own band instead would drop the warning wherever it
	 * publishes none, which is the direction the paragraph above rules out, so the number stays and
	 * {@link #ceilingAttribution} states its provenance. Note what that does NOT change: which row is
	 * chosen, and what the chip CALLS the substance ({@link SubstanceSubjects}, issue #206) — the
	 * attribution names a second row inside one sentence, and it is worded as a contrast precisely so
	 * that it cannot be read as a second claim about the patient.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Issue #245 — and the dose is read for the SUBSTANCE, which is what makes the stricter
	 * sibling ceiling reachable at all.</b> The walk above tries every row, but it used to re-READ the
	 * answer once per row, and the read was gated on that row's own aliases
	 * ({@link #attributedDoses}). So a row whose alias the answer's wording did not happen to use was
	 * handed no dose to compare, and its band — however strict — could not trip: over those same two
	 * rows, a stated 2500 mg/day was attributed to the unqualified row alone, cleared its 3000 ceiling,
	 * and raised NOTHING, though the presentation the patient is actually on publishes 2000. That is
	 * this layer's one forbidden direction (a missing warning) reached through the same row/subject
	 * split #208 reported as a mis-naming, and it leaves no trace at all — no chip, no log line,
	 * nothing separating "within the ceiling" from "compared against the wrong ceiling".
	 *
	 * <p>The read is therefore hoisted out of the loop and scoped to the substance: rows of one
	 * substance are not competitors for a dose, they are one drug, so "which row's alias sits nearest"
	 * was never the question. One answer, read once, compared against every row's band. Note what that
	 * does and does not settle about WHICH ceiling gets quoted — the order is unchanged and still
	 * first-to-trip, not strictest: the subject is tried first and now genuinely has a dose to compare,
	 * so its own ceiling is quoted wherever the stated dose EXCEEDS it, while a dose that clears the
	 * subject's band and exceeds a sibling's is reported against the sibling's, with
	 * {@link #ceilingAttribution} saying whose it is (#208). That fallback is the whole reason #208
	 * rejected "prefer the subject's band" outright, and it is what keeps a band published only by a
	 * sibling from becoming a lost warning. What this cannot do is warn where the data does not: the
	 * widening is over the rows of ONE substance, and {@link #substanceOwnsDose} still lets any OTHER
	 * substance's nearer alias take the dose away.

	 * substance's aliases is the nearest drug name to it (no OTHER substance's alias sits strictly

	 * a neighbouring sentence is never applied.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Scoped to the substance, not to the row (issue #245).</b> This took a single {@code ref} and

	 * stricter ceiling was never compared against — a missing warning, silently. Rows of one substance
	 * publish one substance's dosing; which of them a clinician's sentence happened to name is not
	 * information about the dose.
	 *
	 * <p><b>One rule for what a clause names, at both steps (issue #260).</b> The gate and the
	 * nearest-name comparison now ask {@link DrugReference} the same question — the PROSE rule, symmetric
	 * word boundaries over a diacritic fold — where the comparison used to search for a raw substring.
	 * The two disagreed in both directions and both were silent: {@code penicillin} inside the plural
	 * {@code penicillins} located a rival the gate says the clause does not name, which vetoed a real
	 * dose, and {@code paracetamol} written {@code paracétamol} located nothing at all, so a subject the
	 * gate had just accepted could not claim its own.
	 *
	 * <p><b>And it moves a warning the other way too</b>, which is worth stating because this layer's
	 * standing rule is that nothing firing today may stop. Applying the fold to the whole clause applies
	 * it to RIVALS as well: an answer writing another drug's name with diacritics now locates that rival,
	 * so it can take a dose the raw search left with the subject. That is the accented case above read
	 * from the other side, and it is what the arm's contract asks for — the number was stated nearer the
	 * other drug's name. The boundary half moves toward more warnings except in one case — where the
	 * occurrence NEAREST the dose was a substring one. Then the substance's nearest distance grows, and the
	 * dose can fall outside {@link #MAX_ALIAS_TO_DOSE_DISTANCE} or a rival can become strictly nearer. That case is the
	 * defect itself: a substring is not a naming, so that dose was never this substance's to claim.
	 *
	 * <p>Known limitation (v1): only the literal unit {@code mg} is recognised; doses written in
	 * grams ("1 g"), "mgs", or "milligrams" are not parsed and will not be flagged. That is the
	 * conservative (miss, never false-positive) direction.
	 *
	 * <p>Nesting no longer double-attributes (issue #270). Where two substances' published names nest,
	 * their occurrences can sit at the same distance from the dose — a prefix pair does when the dose
	 * PRECEDES them (shared start), a suffix pair when it FOLLOWS them (shared end), and neither ties in
	 * the other arrangement — so neither was strictly nearer and BOTH claimed the number. The
	 * boundary rule never touched it, because {@code estrone} is a whole word inside {@code estrone
	 * sulfate} and the prose rule finds it exactly where a substring search does; what closed it was
	 * giving {@link #substanceOwnsDose} the occurrence's SPAN, so a tie can be settled by containment.
	 * Two equally-near names neither of which contains the other remain ambiguous and both still claim.

	 *         <p><b>That sentence is about #245's two edits and no longer about the predicate as a
	 *         whole</b> (issue #270). The containment filter below deliberately DOES cost a warning the

	 *         NEAREST the number is a strict sub-span of a rival's name.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Its plainest form is also the case it exists for, and it belongs here because the
	 *         veto scoping below refuses the very same silence.</b> Where the substance's ONLY mention is
	 *         nested it is not named in that clause at all, so it claims nothing — and where the
	 *         container publishes no band, which is the ordinary case for a combination product, the
	 *         number is then warned about by NOBODY ({@code Dexamethasone and framycetin 2.5 mg daily}
	 *         against framycetin's 1 mg/day ceiling). Accepted, and what separates it from the case below
	 *         is which question produced the silence. This filter answers whether the clause NAMES this
	 *         substance; where it does not there is nothing to hang the number on, exactly as if the
	 *         knowledge base carried no row for the combination. The veto answers which of two NAMED
	 *         claimants owns the number, and silence there means the arm found a claimant standing beside
	 *         the number and then discarded it. So "unwarned by anybody" is decisive in the second place
	 *         and not the first — read as an absolute it would forbid the filter too.
	 *
	 *         <p>Beyond that, the loss is not confined to a substance whose only mention was nested. One
	 *         named elsewhere too rests its claim on the surviving mentions and meets the ordinary rule
	 *         from there, so a survivor can fall outside {@link #MAX_ALIAS_TO_DOSE_DISTANCE}, or can lose
	 *         to an independent rival the nested mention would have out-ranked
	 *         ({@code Amoxicillin and clavulanate 2.5 mg, estrone too, clavulanate later} attributes to
	 *         the combination and no longer also to Clavulanate, because Estrone sits between the number
	 *         and Clavulanate's surviving mention). Measured through the real {@code validate} over
	 *         {@code drug-reference-nested-name-dose-tie.json}: this arm and the per-row form differ on
	 *         six of the fifteen clauses {@code NestedNameDoseTieTest} carries, all six removals, and
	 *         each of the three shapes is a case there rather than a sentence here. The scalar minimum
	 *         lives in the local {@code nearest}, computed AFTER that filter; {@code mine} is the list of
	 *         occurrences, and nothing here has a magnitude until the filter has run.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Which is narrower than the filter alone would make it, and deliberately</b> (round-1
	 *         review of #270). Dropping the nested occurrence RAISES {@code nearest}, so on its own the
	 *         filter also handed the container an ordinary strictly-nearer veto over a mention that is
	 *         not nested at all: on {@code Amoxicillin and clavulanate ok, 2.5 mg clavulanate daily} the
	 *         combination's name ends 5 characters before the number while the surviving standalone
	 *         mention starts 7 after it, so the substance the clause doses BY NAME lost its warning — and
	 *         where the container publishes no band of its own, the number went unwarned by anybody.
	 *         That is the silence the paragraph above says this predicate may not produce — a claimant the
	 *         clause names beside the number, found and then discarded — so a rival whose nearness is
	 *         INHERITED from one of {@code mine} does not veto ({@link #nearnessInheritedFrom}). Scoped to
	 *         inherited nearness and not to containment, because a container can be nearer by a word of
	 *         its OWN — measured, and barring those too would add an attribution the per-row form never
	 *         made, which is the bound that method's javadoc states.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>And barring the container is not enough where THREE names nest</b> (rounds 2 and 3 of
	 *         #270). The seam was asymmetric: the filter judged {@code mine} for being mere sub-spans
	 *         while the veto walked every rival regardless. So a rival the clause names ONLY inside a
	 *         longer name still vetoed the substance the clause doses BY NAME — the standalone
	 *         {@code potassium} at the tail of {@code Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium ok, 2.5 mg
	 *         clavulanate potassium daily}, and the leading constituent {@code dexamethasone} of
	 *         {@code Dexamethasone and framycetin ok, 2.5 mg was given and then framycetin later}, which
	 *         at distance 20 took the number from the surviving mention at 26. Measured through the real
	 *         {@code validate}: nothing else in either clause publishes a ceiling, so each raised no
	 *         warning of any kind, which the per-row form does not do. Closed by asking a rival the same
	 *         containment question the filter asks the subject, against the same UNFILTERED
	 *         {@code rivals}.
	 *
	 *         <p>One-directional by arithmetic, and this half needs stating because barring a
	 *         veto is the permissive direction. Containment bounds a container to no farther than what it
	 *         contains, so a barred rival {@code R} lies inside some rival {@code C} with
	 *         {@code distance(C) <= distance(R)}, and the chain of containers ends at a rival contained by
	 *         no rival — which this bar never touches, so it vetoes in {@code R}'s place. The only chain
	 *         that ends barred ends at a container barred as INHERITED, i.e. at
	 *         {@code distance(C) == distance(m)} for some {@code m} in {@code mine}; the per-row form's
	 *         minimum is then no greater than {@code distance(m)}, which is {@code <= distance(R)}, so
	 *         {@code R} was not strictly nearer THERE either and never vetoed in that form. Re-measured
	 *         over the enlarged fixture: still six of the fifteen clauses, still all six removals, and
	 *         the round-3 clause itself is not one of them — this arm and the per-row form agree on it.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>What that skip gives up, since it is not free either.</b> Where the container's
	 *         dose-facing edge IS this substance's name, the surviving mention faces no rival at all from
	 *         that quarter — so a mention on the far side of the number keeps a dose the container
	 *         states: on {@code Amoxicillin and clavulanate 2.5 mg daily was fine,
	 *         clavulanate is renally cleared} Clavulanate claims the combination's 2.5 mg from 23
	 *         characters away. Measured, that is what the per-row form does too — the choice neither
	 *         introduces that attribution nor removes it — so it is a case this issue leaves open rather
	 *         than one the fix creates. Closing it means a rule about the
	 *         number's IMMEDIATE neighbour ({@code N mg <name>} outranking a nearer name before it),
	 *         which is a different rule needing its own measurement. Pinned in both directions by
	 *         {@code NestedNameDoseTieTest} so neither can move in silence.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>The two edits do not cover the same case, and it is worth being exact about which
	 *         does the work.</b> The defect issue #245 was filed for — {@code Amoxicillin} sitting
	 *         closer to a dose than {@code Amoxicillin (suspension)} and taking it from a row of the
	 *         same drug — is repaired entirely by pooling the rows: the veto below walks
	 *         DIFFERENT-substance rivals only, so no row of this substance can take its own substance's
	 *         dose however near it lands. The exclusion below covers only a row of this substance that this pass did NOT
	 *         resolve (neither in play nor named by an active order) whose alias happens to land nearer
	 *         the dose. That is a narrower case and no bundled fixture poses it, so nothing here pins the
	 *         exclusion — it stays because it is the same defect one step out, not because a test reaches
	 *         it, and trimming it to what the tests happen to reach would reintroduce that defect.
	 *
	 *         <p>That exclusion is the veto's IDENTITY test and nothing more, because the two lists are
	 *         drawn from different universes: {@code mine} from the rows this pass resolved,
	 *         {@code rivals} from {@code allEntries}. An unresolved row of this substance is therefore
	 *         absent from BOTH, so its longer name neither disqualifies a nested occurrence of the
	 *         subject nor bars a rival nested inside it — pre-existing, and shared with the per-row
	 *         form.
	 *
	 *         <p>Identity is {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()}, the module's one answer to "are
	 *         these rows one substance?", so this arm cannot merge a set of rows that the chip's subject
	 *         chooser and the contraindication ledger would split. For a dataset publishing no substance
	 *         name that key is the row itself, which reproduces the per-row behaviour exactly — the case
	 *         every bundled dataset is in.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>"Named" here means what it means everywhere else</b>
	 *         ({@link DrugReference#namedOccurrences}, the prose rule), which it did not until issue
	 *         #260: the walk below asked every entry in the knowledge base a RAW SUBSTRING question,
	 *         which the clause gate above would have answered no to. The walk itself is unchanged — what
	 *         changed is the question. An entry the clause does not name could take a dose away from one
	 *         it does, and, the same disagreement reversed, a subject the gate had just accepted could
	 *         fail to locate itself.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>That second one is now closed structurally, and how it used to fail is worth
	 *         keeping.</b> The gate re-folded the clause ({@link DrugReference#matchesText} folds its
	 *         own operands) while this reads the clause exactly as {@link #attributedDoses} established
	 *         it, and {@link DrugReference#foldedLower} is not idempotent — see there. Measured
	 *         2026-08-14 through both production methods: an entry whose alias is {@code a}, U+1D165,
	 *         U+1D16D was matched by the gate in a clause folded from {@code a}, U+1D16D, U+0E31,
	 *         U+1D165 and was NOT located here, so that substance had no occurrence at all for a clause
	 *         that passed. Unreachable from any dataset or chart string — it needs musical combining
	 *         marks in a drug name — and this paragraph used to end "closing it means changing which
	 *         accessor {@link #namesSubstance} calls, which CLAUDE.md governs. Reported rather than
	 *         taken." Issue #330 built that accessor ({@link DrugReference#matchesFoldedText}) and
	 *         {@link #namesSubstance} calls it, so the gate and the locator read one string. Pinned by a
	 *         source guard rather than by the compiler, and the difference matters: the prose operand is
	 *         a bare {@code String} by design, so handing this one to the unfolded arity COMPILES — a
	 *         review reverted the call with the whole api suite green before
	 *         {@code FoldedOperandTest.theDoseArmsClauseGateReadsTheClauseTheArmFolded} existed.
