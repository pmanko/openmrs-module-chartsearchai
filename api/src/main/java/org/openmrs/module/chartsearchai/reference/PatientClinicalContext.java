 * The slice of a patient's clinical state the drug-reference feature needs:

 * weight-aware per-dose overdose check; {@code null} = unknown, check skipped),
 * the names/ATC codes of active drug orders (for interaction checks and
 * order-driven injection), the active drug orders themselves — names and codes attributed to the
 * order they came from, both for reconciling the safety layer's read against the serialized chart
 * (see {@link DrugReferenceInjector#unrepresentedActiveOrders}) and so the interaction screen can
 * exclude a subject's own order from witnessing it, each also carrying what the chart records about
 * where the drug is APPLIED (issue #234 — see
 * {@link ActiveDrugOrder#getAdministrationTerms()}) — lowercased text tokens
 * from active allergies and conditions (for contraindication checks), and the names the loaded
 * reference data gives those same active drugs (issue #136 — see
 * {@link #getActiveDrugReferenceNames()}).
 *
 * <p>This is a pure value object so the injector and validator can be unit-tested
 * with hand-built contexts, while production builds one from a {@code Patient} via
 * {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder}. Keeping the OpenMRS-{@code Context} reads in
 * a separate builder is what lets the matching/validation logic run without a
 * live OpenMRS context. The reference names are the one field the builder cannot fill, since they
 * come from the drug dataset rather than from the patient; they are attached afterwards by
 * {@link DrugReferenceService#withReferenceNames}, and a context without them behaves exactly as
 * every context did before #136.

	 *         difference is not cosmetic: an entry's alias list carries combination-product names, so
	 *         {@code salicylic acid / urea} is an alias of the Urea entry as well as of the Salicylic
	 *         acid one, and scanning a rule's token across those names would report a patient on urea

	 *         Identity asks the same question {@code DrugSafetyValidator.identifies} asks of the
	 *         reference side, so the two agree about when a rule names a given drug, and over the
	 *         order-NAME leg it makes this arm provably equal to resolving the rule's token to its
	 *         partner entries and matching THEIR names against the order name — the formulation issue
	 *         #136 proposed, at one dataset sweep per pass instead of one per rule. (Equal, not merely
	 *         equal in measurement: an entry supplies a name here exactly when the order name resolves
	 *         it, which is the same predicate that formulation applies to the partner. Where the two
	 *         differ is the ATC leg, which this one also reaches — an order mapped to an entry's exact
	 *         level-5 code is that substance, so the entry's names are the patient's names too.)
	 *
	 *         <p><b>The reference-name arm is asked FIRST</b> since issue #330, though which of the two
	 *         answers comes back is immaterial — both return true — and the order is not part of the

	 * which both boundary rules refuse), so a boundary rule here would silently stop matching
	 * the rules that exist. <b>Two other examples stood here until 2026-09-03 and were deleted rather
	 * than reworded, because measurement refuted them</b>: {@code peptic ulcer} inside "history of
	 * peptic ulcer disease" is ACCEPTED by {@link DrugReference#containsWord} and by
	 * {@link DrugReference#matchesOrderName} alike, and {@code nsaid} inside "NSAIDs" is accepted by
	 * the order-name rule (its two-letter tail allowance covers the plural) and refused only by
	 * {@code containsWord}. Neither is a case for bare containment; the one above is, and it is
	 * #223's own measured witness below. The nesting risk is the same in principle ({@code opium} against an
	 * allergen recorded as "Tiotropium") and this javadoc used to ask for its own measurement over
	 * allergy text rather than the order-name corpus that settled #86.
	 *
	 * <p><b>That measurement was made (issue #223)</b>, and it is why this stayed as it is. Over the
	 * shipped 19 MB KB's 5169 published names as the allergen corpus, of the ten rules the bundled
	 * curated file publishes, moving this match to the drug-NAME rule loses 5 real allergen names and
	 * every one is on the CLASS token {@code penicillin} ({@code benzylpenicillin},
	 * {@code phenoxymethylpenicillin}, {@code procaine benzylpenicillin} …); the three tokens that name
	 * their own entry lose nothing. So the token shapes really do want different rules, and what moved
	 * instead are the two decisions the nesting risk had made dangerous — which chip sentence a
	 * self-named rule may speak in ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.contraindicationRank}, issue #223) and
	 * whether an injected record may state its clause as the chart's own reading
	 * ({@code DrugReferenceInjector.corroborated}, issue #269). Both read
	 * {@link #allergensMatching} for the witnesses this method does not report.
	 *
	 * <p>What that corpus bounds, stated rather than implied: published reference NAMES, the shape a
	 * coded allergen carries. It is not the localized dictionary {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder}
	 * actually reads a coded allergen's name out of (unreachable when this was measured), and not free
	 * text at all, which is what a {@code nonCodedAllergen} is. It bounds the CLASS-token loss, which is
	 * what the decision turned on; re-measure on the dictionary before reopening it.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The CONDITION list was measured too (issue #309), and it did NOT stay as it is.</b> The
	 * question the ticket asked was whether a plausible curated condition token nests inside a plausible
	 * recorded condition the way {@code opium} nests inside {@code Tiotropium}. It does, and the false
	 * matches are clinical. Measured over the OpenMRS 3.7.1 reference-application demo dictionary,
	 * through this method and the real {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder} normalization, against two
	 * corpora: the 704 distinct concepts actually RECORDED in that database's {@code conditions} table
	 * (853 rows), and the 2581 Diagnosis/Finding/Symptom concepts that table's {@code condition_coded}
	 * CAN hold. Both are {@code en} locale-preferred concept names, which is what
	 * {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder.addConceptName} reads through {@code Concept.getName()} — so
	 * these bound an {@code en} deployment, and #141's {@code Pénicilline G} paragraph above is the
	 * standing reminder that a francophone one reads different strings for the same concepts.
	 *
	 * <p>The hazard, over the candidate corpus, as (values matched / matched only inside a longer word),
	 * under {@link DrugReference#containsWord}: {@code liver} 30/20, every one of the twenty a
	 * deliver/delivery form ({@code Status Post Cesarean Delivery}, {@code Preterm Delivery});
	 * {@code deficiency} 14/7, every one an immunoDEFICIENCY; {@code mania} 8/6
	 * ({@code Leishmaniasis}, {@code Kleptomania}); {@code psoriasis} 4/2 ({@code Large plaque
	 * parapsoriasis}, a different disease); {@code renal} 7/1 ({@code Malignant tumor of adrenal
	 * gland}); {@code gi} 112/111. A hepatic or renal contraindication is the most
	 * ordinary curated condition rule there is, so this is not an exotic shape.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What the fix could NOT be, and this is the part worth keeping.</b> The ticket proposed a
	 * token-shape validity rule — "a condition token too short or too generic to be safe". No threshold
	 * over the TOKEN separates safe from unsafe: taking every contiguous word run of a corpus value as a
	 * plausible token (13908 distinct over the candidate corpus, 4968 over the recorded one), the
	 * hazardous ones occur at 35 distinct character lengths spanning 1 to 46 and at every word count
	 * from 1 to 6, and the longest — {@code traumatic intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage} — nests
	 * inside {@code Nontraumatic intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage}, which is to say inside its own
	 * NEGATION. Hazard is a property of the (token, recorded value) PAIR, and the loader holds no
	 * condition corpus to pair against. A length rule is still defensible as a REPORTED loader finding
	 * (at one to three characters a single-word token is hazardous 61-100% of the time on both corpora),
	 * and it was declined because it warns rather than fixes, is silent on five of the six witnesses
	 * above (every one but {@code gi} is five characters or more), and is silent by construction on
	 * every shipped dataset — ADR Decision 73 carries the three together.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What the fix IS: a boundary, asked of the match rather than of the token.</b>
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.aMatchedConditionCarriesTheToken} — the third leg of
	 * {@code corroboratedByTheChart}, carrying its own residue. The ticket's premise, that a condition
	 * has no corroborating question because no arm resolves it to a reference substance, is true of the
	 * two ALLERGY legs and does not settle the matter: what redeems a condition match is whether the
	 * token reached the record as a WORD of it. This match itself is untouched and stays bare, for the
	 * reason the paragraph above gives.
	 *
	 * <p>The LOSS of that boundary rule over the two corpora above is ZERO, and <b>what that zero is a
	 * loss OF is ONE token, whose matches are counted per corpus and never summed into a total</b> —
	 * 5 of the 2581 candidate values and 1 of the 704 recorded ones. State it that way wherever it is
	 * published, because "all four tokens verified" reads as four confirmations and it is one, and a
	 * single total reads as a larger evidence base than either corpus supplies (issue #243's rule; the
	 * unbounded form had reached every document carrying this claim before it was measured, and the
	 * summed form that replaced it then reached every one of them too).
	 * "The curated condition population" below means the one this repo SHIPS; an
	 * operator's own file is by definition unmeasured, which is what the loader-rule paragraph is about.
	 * The four condition tokens the bundled seed publishes ({@code gi bleed}, {@code peptic
	 * ulcer}, {@code severe hepatic}, {@code renal impairment} — the TOKENS, and not the four strings
	 * #309's own body names in their place: two of those are these rules' {@code note} fields
	 * ({@code active gastrointestinal bleeding}, {@code active peptic ulcer disease}) and the other two
	 * ({@code avoid in CKD stage 4 or worse}, {@code avoid in severe hepatic impairment}) are neither a
	 * token nor a note of any rule the seed ships, so a token set re-derived from the ticket finds two
	 * of its four strings nowhere) match 1 value over the recorded corpus and 5 over the
	 * candidate one, and every one of those matched values carries its token as a whole word.
	 * Per token, and this is the part the aggregate hides: {@code peptic ulcer} accounts for ALL of
	 * them — 5 candidate, 1 recorded, none mid-word — while {@code gi bleed}, {@code severe hepatic}
	 * and {@code renal impairment} match nothing at all in either corpus, so the claim is vacuously
	 * true for three of the four and neither corpus says anything about what the boundary rule would
	 * do to them. Not a total of six: the recorded
	 * concepts are a subset of the candidate ones, so those counts overlap and must not be summed. That
	 * is the proxy issue #223 used to settle the allergy side, run for conditions — with the same
	 * weakness that proxy always had, three of these four tokens being as unmeasured against a coded
	 * corpus as an operator's own file is. Measured 2026-09-03 by driving each corpus value through
	 * {@link #hasConditionToken} and then through
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.aMatchedConditionCarriesTheToken}, over the rules
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.isConditionRule} selects from the shipped curated seed.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Both corpora are CODED concept names, and the rule DOES cost the free-text half — including
	 * on the shipped seed's own tokens.</b> A condition a clinician types as {@code GI bleeding} is
	 * hedged against {@code gi bleed}, and {@code peptic ulceration} against {@code peptic ulcer}: an
	 * INFLECTION, the commonest shape in free text and one neither corpus can exhibit. Neither of the
	 * module's two allowances reaches them — 0 letters for prose and 2 for an order name, against tails
	 * of three and five — and inventing a third at a call site is what issue #260 forbids, so what
	 * would actually close this is morphology rather than a wider tail. The other shape is a prefix or
	 * suffix compound that is clinically the same finding: {@code edema} 13/7, {@code carcinoma} 8/2
	 * ({@code Adenocarcinoma}), {@code arthritis} 10/3 ({@code Osteoarthritis of knee}),
	 * {@code cerebral} 10/2, {@code ulcer} 21/2. Both are hedged rather than dropped — the section
	 * asserts nothing and denies nothing, the contraindication is still listed and the chip still fires
	 * — and both are cases rather than sentences:
	 * {@code ConditionRuleBoundaryCorroborationTest.anInflectionOfAShippedTokenIsHedged} and
	 * {@code .aClinicallyRightCompoundIsHedgedToo}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>That the chip survives is a residue as well as a mitigation, and it must not be cited as
	 * only the second.</b> On the HAZARD case the surviving chip's SENTENCE is the false claim: for a
	 * patient whose one recorded condition is {@code Status Post Cesarean Delivery}, the injected record
	 * and the {@code safety_finding} hedge, and the chip still reads
	 * "… is contraindicated by an active condition: acute hepatitis or liver failure" — an unqualified
	 * assertion about the chart. Measured 2026-09-03 by driving
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.validate} over
	 * {@code chartsearchai-test/drug-reference-condition-token-nesting.json}. #309 fixed the
	 * model-facing half only, and issue #374 publishes the chip's own answer as
	 * {@code restsOnAnUncorroboratedChartMatch}, so the surface no longer WITHHOLDS it. Tightening
	 * this match was never the remedy and still is not (it is fail-open — see the boundary rule's
	 * free-text cost above). ADR Decisions 73 and 92.
	 *
	 * <p>That the corpora cannot reach free text is a property of the source: that database's
	 * {@code condition_non_coded} column holds ONE placeholder string across all 853 rows, so a
	 * condition recorded in the clinician's own wording — the shape the fragment rationale above is
	 * really about — is unmeasured on both sides of this rule, and the two inflections above are
	 * reasoned from the rule rather than counted. This repo does not carry that dictionary, so none of
	 * these figures is re-derivable here; what is stated is which population each is over. What CAN be
	 * pinned here is the token set the zero-cost claim is ABOUT, and it is:
	 * {@code ConditionRuleBoundaryCorroborationTest.theShippedSeedPublishesExactlyTheFourConditionTokensTheMeasurementWasOver}.
	 *
	 * <p>Exposure today is confined to hand-authored
	 * contraindication rules: neither the {@code ddinter} nor the {@code atc} source emits any, and the
	 * allergy contraindication arm ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.addAllergyContraindications}) resolves
	 * allergens through {@link DrugReferenceService#findImpliedSubstances}, and so through
	 * {@link DrugReferenceService#lookupByToken} beneath it, which is boundary-aware.
	 * Boundary-aware is not the same as correct, though, and this is not a clean contrast: since issue
	 * #176 that resolver prefers an entry the allergen NAMES over one whose alias merely occurs inside the
	 * allergen, which settles the fragment case for every name the KB itself publishes, but an allergen
	 * recorded as free text that names no entry at all still resolves by containment or not at all.
	 * What it does rule out is this method's failure mode — a token matching mid-word.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Diacritics are folded on both sides (issue #141)</b>, through the one shared
	 * {@link DrugReference#foldDiacritics}. This was the matcher #129/#138 did not reach: that work
	 * folded {@link DrugReference#containsBoundedToken}, the order-name scan, and scoped itself there,
	 * leaving this one comparing raw code points. On the SHIPPED DEFAULT source format
	 * ({@code sourceFormat=json}) the curated Amoxicillin entry's {@code penicillin} allergy token
	 * therefore missed an allergen recorded as {@code Pénicilline G} — a real fr locale-preferred name
	 * in the 3.7.1 dictionary, and {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder} reads the concept name in the
	 * CURRENT locale, so a francophone deployment reaches it by default. Measured 2026-08-05 over that
	 * dictionary's 1219 allergen-candidate names: 11 gained, 0 lost, all of them
	 * {@code penicillin}/{@code paracetamol} spellings. Folding is the WHOLE change — containment
	 * already tolerates the trailing {@code -e}/{@code -s} of {@code Pénicillines}, so no boundary or
	 * inflection rule comes with it, and the fragment matching above is untouched.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Not the allergen's comment or reactions.</b> This javadoc used to say the allergy haystack
	 * was "an allergen name plus its comments"; it never was —
	 * {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder} reads {@code codedAllergen}'s name and
	 * {@code nonCodedAllergen} and never calls {@code Allergy.getComment()} or
	 * {@code getReactions()}. Reading the comment is not a free widening either, which is why the claim
	 * was corrected rather than made true: a comment can NEGATE ("tolerated penicillin, no reaction"),
	 * and the same strings feed {@code lookupByToken}, so a comment would be read as the allergen
	 * itself and fabricate an allergy. A reaction is a symptom, not a drug. The fragment rationale
	 * above survives on {@code nonCodedAllergen}, which is genuinely free text.
	 *

	 * One of the patient's active drug orders, identified well enough to be reconciled against the

	 * under, so the two reads can be matched exactly), the display name, and every name that
	 * identifies the order in record text.
	 *
	 * <p>Also carries the ATC codes the order's own concept maps to, so a code can be attributed back
	 * to the order that contributed it (issue #132). Without that, {@link #getActiveDrugAtcCodes()} is
	 * the only place codes live and "one order carrying two codes" is indistinguishable from "two
	 * orders each carrying one" — which let a single order witness an interaction between the two
	 * reference entries its own codes resolve to (see
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.activeOrdersOtherThan}). Kept as an association rather than gathered
	 * separately: {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder} already reads these codes off the order's
	 * concept in the same single {@code getActiveOrders} pass that fills the names.
	 *
	 * <p>Deliberately carries no dosing. The whole point of the reconciliation is that this module
	 * must not hold one fact and present it two ways, and a second dose-rendering path beside
	 * querystore's is exactly that. The display name already carries the strength in real data
	 * ("Simvastatin Co 20mg"), and the citation resolves to the order itself for the rest.
	 *
	 * <p><b>One class of order is identified LESS well than the above, deliberately</b> (issue #290):
	 * {@link #namedByCodesOnly} stands in for an order no name could be read for, so its display is a
	 * list of its own ATC codes and it has no names at all. Of the identity described above it carries
	 * only the uuid: no name identifies it in record text, so the reconciliation can match it by uuid
	 * alone, and its display carries no strength because it is not a drug name. Ask
	 * {@link #hasKnownName()} before letting the display DISPLACE a name some other source supplied;
	 * labelling something that has no other name is what the display is for. It is still far
	 * better than the alternative it replaced: such an order used to be omitted entirely while its codes
	 * still reached {@link #getActiveDrugAtcCodes()}, which made one prescription look like one partner
	 * per code the loaded dataset could not name — a covered code is keyed on its substance either way,
	 * so that half is unchanged and deliberate.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Beside its identity it carries one thing about the prescription itself</b> (issue #234):
	 * where the chart says the drug is applied, as {@link #getAdministrationTerms()}. It is on every
	 * rung including the code-only one, and it is read by exactly one arm — see that accessor and
	 * {@link #namedByCodesOnly(String, String, Set, Set)}, which records why the rung it cannot reach
	 * carries it anyway.
