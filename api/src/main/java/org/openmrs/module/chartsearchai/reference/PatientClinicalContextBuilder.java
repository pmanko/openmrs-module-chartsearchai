				// per covered substance before and after, which is deliberate (see OrderPartner.substances
				// — two covered codes must stay two partners). Measured through the real validate over the

				// falls back to the first fully-specified name in ANY locale, then to any synonym. What
				// reaches this branch is a name that could not be READ — addConceptName swallowing a
				// RuntimeException from a detached or lazy-init proxy while addAtcCodes succeeds in a
				// separate try, voided names, or a blank recorded name (addRaw drops it, so getName()
				// need not be null at all).
				//
				// The name set stays EMPTY because it is matched against chart prose, so a code in it
				// would match free text; the cost of that is in the ADR. The display is built from the
				// normalized codes rather than the raw ones so that the label, the test below and the
				// codes ActiveDrugOrder stores cannot disagree — NOT as a defence against a blank code,
				// which addRaw already dropped. An order with no name and no code is still skipped:
				// nothing can name it and no chip can be raised for it, which is what the old skip was
				// right about. The WARN is the only trace that a chip is speaking for an order the module
				// could not name; it does not distinguish a name that could not be read from a concept
				// that has none, because no consumer behaves differently on that today. It REPEATS, and
				// that is accepted rather than overlooked: build() is called once by
				// DrugReferenceInjector.inject and once by DrugSafetyValidator.validate, so one such
				// order emits two identical lines per /search for as long as the dictionary defect
				// stands. Not deduped, because the only dedup available here is a JVM-lifetime set of
				// order uuids — unbounded on per-patient keys, and it would answer for whoever asked
				// first, so an operator who turns to the log later would find no trace at all. The

	 * Shared by every catch in {@link #build} that degrades a read to an empty value, so their
	 * wording, their level and the rule below cannot drift apart. Every one of those, and not only
	 * the three the published verdict is built from: a stamp decides whether a failure reaches
	 * {@code ChartSearchService.ChartAnswer.getChartReadForSafety()}, and has never been what
	 * decides whether an operator is told. Age and weight carry no stamp and each has a residue of
	 * its own, recorded at their catches.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The per-concept reads those catches enclose are deliberately NOT shared with this and
	 * stay at {@code log.debug}</b> — {@link #conceptUuid}, {@link #addConceptName},
	 * {@link #addConceptNames} and {@link #addAtcCodes}. Each reads a lazy association off a
	 * {@code Concept} the enclosing service call has already returned, so it is an entity property
	 * read and not a service call: core's {@code AuthorizationAdvice} advises the service layer and
	 * never sees it, no {@code @Authorized} privilege gates it, and the sentence this method exists
	 * to write — the privileges to grant — would have nothing to name. What reaches those catches is
	 * a store fault or an association that cannot be initialised, not the missing-privilege cause.
	 * Their residue is one record's worth of one read — the tokens, names or uuid of the single
	 * allergy, condition or order being walked — where a catch here abandons the whole read, the
	 * records not yet walked included. Raising them is a change to how loud a HEALTHY install is per
	 * record, which issue #247 measured nothing about; {@link #conceptUuid}'s own javadoc carries
	 * what its failure costs.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The stack trace is kept for every cause but the expected one.</b> An
	 * {@code APIAuthenticationException} is a role missing one of {@code privileges} and nothing
	 * else; the message already names the privileges to grant, the top frame of its trace is only
	 * core's own {@code AuthorizationAdvice}, and the condition persists until someone acts on it —
	 * so on {@code GET /chartsearchai/chartalerts}, which {@code README.md} documents as applying no
	 * rate limit, the trace would repeat for the life of the misconfiguration and say nothing new.
	 * Every other {@code RuntimeException} — a fault in the store underneath the service call, most
	 * of all — keeps its trace, because there the trace IS the diagnosis. Deliberately not a
	 * throttle: {@code DrugSafetyValidator.standingChartAlerts} records why one would hide the line
	 * a diagnosis needs.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The drop is conditional on there BEING a privilege to name</b>, which is why it is not
	 * written as a bare {@code instanceof}. A read that names none — the age read, which makes no
	 * service call — would otherwise answer an authorization failure with neither a privilege nor a
	 * trace, which is a line carrying no diagnosis at all. The justification for dropping the trace
	 * is the naming; where there is no naming there is no justification.
	 *
	 * <p><b>So {@code privileges} must be the ones gating the caller's OWN read</b> — all of them,
	 * since a read making two service calls can fail on either — and that is pinned rather than left
	 * to the copy-paste: each call sits in a case of {@code ChartReadFailureLoudnessContextTest} that
	 * refuses exactly one of its privileges and asserts the resulting line names that one. Swap one
	 * call's constant for a neighbour's and read the failure — the level assertions cannot see it,
	 * and on the trace-dropped cause the message is all an operator gets.
	 *
	 * @param privileges the core privileges gating this read, in the order the sentence should name

	/**
	 * The names one active drug order is identified by, in the order they are collected — which is also
	 * their rank, because the caller takes the FIRST of them as the order's display.
	 *
	 * <p>Three sources since issue #293, and the middle one is that issue. A drug order the clinician
	 * recorded as free text normally carries no coded {@code Drug} but does carry a concept, so wherever
	 * that concept's name could be read it was not NAMELESS — it arrived carrying the WRONG name, which
	 * is a state issue #290's code-only rung is not about.
	 * {@code OrderServiceImpl.ensureConceptIsSet} assigns such an order
	 * {@code OrderService.getNonCodedDrugConcept()} — the concept the {@code drugOrder.drugOther} global
	 * property names ("the concept which represents drug other non coded") — whenever it reaches
	 * {@code saveOrder} with no concept of its own, and {@code DrugOrderValidator} treats exactly that
	 * concept as the non-coded shape. So the concept of a free-text order is the platform's own
	 * placeholder wherever the client supplied none; a client MAY supply one and keep it, which is the
	 * shape the cost paragraphs below turn on. Either way it is not the drug, while
	 * {@code getDrugNonCoded()} holds what the clinician actually typed — and that field had no
	 * production caller in this module at all. The asymmetry is the tell: {@code build} above already
	 * reads the free-text half of the two other records it collects, {@code getNonCodedAllergen()} and
	 * a condition's {@code getNonCoded()}, through this same {@code addRaw}. Orders were the one
	 * record type read coded-only.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Additive, and ranked between the two existing sources.</b> Nothing is removed: the concept
	 * name stays, so the set of names an order carries only GROWS, and what it grows by is the name the
	 * record itself gives for the drug the clinician recorded. (That is a statement about this method
	 * alone. The whitespace collapse on {@link #addRaw} is a separate change and does move matches in
	 * both directions — its own javadoc has the two measured cases.) It leads the concept name because for a
	 * non-coded order the concept is not the drug, so the display must be the recorded text. It follows
	 * the coded drug's name because a coded identity outranks free text — and that rank is REACHABLE
	 * rather than a legacy concern: {@code DrugOrderValidator} rejects a row carrying both
	 * ({@code DrugOrder.error.onlyOneOfDrugOrNonCodedShouldBeSet}) only inside
	 * {@code validateForRequireDrug}, which returns immediately unless the {@code drugOrder.requireDrug}
	 * global property is true — and that property is {@code false} on a stock install (read off the
	 * 3.7.1 reference-application demo database). So a coded order's display is untouched by this
	 * change under either setting, and
	 * {@code NonCodedDrugOrderNameTest.aCodedDrugsNameStillLeadsWhenARowCarriesFreeTextBesideIt}
	 * pins that.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What being additive costs, pinned rather than argued.</b> Every name of an order is
	 * resolved on its own, so where a client supplies a concept naming one drug and the clinician
	 * types another, one prescription now reports both instead of only the concept's —
	 * {@code NonCodedDrugOrderNameTest.anOrderWhoseConceptAndTextNameDifferentDrugsReportsBoth} is
	 * that case, and it is the right answer rather than something to tune away: the record itself
	 * says two things, and choosing between them would be guessing. The alternative — dropping the
	 * concept name whenever {@code drugNonCoded} is set — loses a real match on an order whose text is
	 * unusable and whose concept is not, a silent fail-CLOSED, which is the failure mode issues #193
	 * and #195 exist to prevent. On the placeholder shape it costs nothing, and that was measured
	 * rather than reasoned: driven through the production accessor
	 * {@code DrugReferenceService.findImpliedByDrugName} over
	 * {@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.shippedEntries()}, generic {@code drugOrder.drugOther} spellings
	 * — {@code Other}, {@code Other non-coded}, {@code Drug other non coded}, {@code Unknown drug},
	 * {@code Medication} among those tried — each put NO entries in play. Try another spelling the same
	 * way rather than trusting that list.
	 *
	 * <p><b>And the largest cost is that this set now contains PROSE.</b> Both earlier sources were
	 * dictionary-controlled single drug names; {@code drugNonCoded} is 255 characters a clinician may
	 * write anything into, and {@code PatientClinicalContext.hasActiveDrug}'s order-name arm is
	 * boundary-matched CONTAINMENT ({@code DrugReference.matchesOrderName}), which is what lets it find
	 * {@code aspirin} inside {@code Aspirine Co 81mg}. So every drug name occurring anywhere in that
	 * text is read as a drug the patient is on — including one the same sentence says was STOPPED.
	 * Measured through the real builder and the real {@code validate} over the pinned DDInter excerpt,
	 * a free text of {@code "Aspirin 81mg - warfarin stopped 2024"} raises a MAJOR
	 * ibuprofen-versus-warfarin chip, which {@code DrugSafetyValidator.licensesWithholding} grades as a
	 * reason to withhold, beside an injected order record rendering that same text verbatim — two
	 * citable records of one prescription in contradiction. It is the failure class issue #317 exists
	 * to prevent, reached by a channel neither {@code SerializedRecord.getOrderActive()} nor
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.describesEndedOrder} can see, because the carrying prescription
	 * really is active. Not closable by refusing free text on suspicion — that is the fix — and not
	 * closable by parsing it, which is the reading-clinical-prose problem this module does not solve
	 * here. Pinned AS WRONG by
	 * {@code NonCodedDrugOrderNameTest.freeTextNamingADrugTheSameSentenceSaysWasStoppedStillRaisesAChip},
	 * so a change that closes it reddens a test.
	 *
	 * <p><b>And prose reaching the DISPLAY costs a legible sentence, which this module has already
	 * decided is worth fixing for the sibling field and does not fix here.</b> The display is printed
	 * unquoted into a chip detail whose own delimiters are em dashes
	 * ({@code … as active order <display> — possible duplicate therapy}) and thence, through
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.renderFinding}, into a citable {@code safety_finding}. Measured
	 * through the real pipeline, a free text of {@code "Naproxen 500mg — hold from 1 Jan. Restart
	 * later"} renders as one sentence carrying two em-dashed clauses and a full stop inside the order
	 * name, with nothing telling a reader which punctuation is the chart's. That is verbatim the hazard
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.quotedToken()} records for {@code nonCodedAllergen} and closes by
	 * quoting the value. It is NOT closed here, and the reason is scope rather than disagreement:
	 * quoting every order display would move what every existing chip naming a coded order says, and
	 * quoting only a free-text one needs {@code ActiveDrugOrder} to carry which source its display came
	 * from, a second flag on that value object. That is a scope choice and nothing standing forbids it
	 * — an earlier wording cited ADR Decision 40 here, which governs {@code OrderPartner}'s flags and
	 * says nothing about this class. If we ship without it, a clinician reads a chip whose sentence boundaries are partly the chart's and the
	 * model reads the same string as evidence; nothing is asserted falsely, and legibility is what is
	 * lost. Pinned by
	 * {@code NonCodedDrugOrderNameTest.aFreeTextDisplayIsPrintedIntoTheChipUnquoted}, so whoever closes
	 * it reddens a test.
	 *
	 * <p>The same divergence reaches the CLASS arm, and there it costs a true sentence rather than an
	 * extra one: that arm labels a co-medication from the order's display while citing a subgroup taken
	 * from the order's CONCEPT, so where the two disagree the chip states a class relationship about a
	 * drug the cited subgroup does not classify. Recorded on {@code DrugSafetyValidator.nameByOrder},
	 * whose premise it weakens, and on ADR Decision 38, which already accepts the same shape for a
	 * nameless order; pinned AS WRONG by
	 * {@code NonCodedDrugOrderNameTest.aClassChipCanNameAnOrderAfterTextTheCitedSubgroupDoesNotClassify}.
	 * The folded chip's RULE sentence is guarded against it by
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.namesNamingOrder}; the class sentence has no such gate available,
	 * because the branch is entered precisely when no code resolved an entry.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It also moves orders OFF issue #290's code-only rung</b>, which is a rung migration and not
	 * merely a relabel: that rung takes an order no name could be READ for (the block in {@code build}
	 * above enumerates the shapes), and free text is now enough to keep such an order on the named rung
	 * — {@code hasKnownName()} true where it was false, so {@code OrderPartner.nameByOrder} and
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.displayNamesADrug} are handed a real name where they had an
	 * {@code [ATC …]} stand-in. The direction is the safe one, since that stand-in is the ABSENCE of a
	 * name; what shrinks is the population issue #290 and ADR Decision 38 reason about.
	 *
	 * <p>A second cost has no test because its subject is chart prose this module does not author:
	 * these names are also matched against that prose by {@code ActiveDrugOrder.namedIn}, so free text
	 * that is a common word rather than a drug name can substantiate an order against unrelated text
	 * and suppress the issue #118 WARN. Nothing here can tell a drug name from junk, and refusing free
	 * text on suspicion would cost the fix.
	 *
	 * <p>Read through {@code addRaw} rather than behind an {@code isNonCodedDrug()} gate: that method IS
	 * {@code StringUtils.isNotBlank(drugNonCoded)}, and {@code addRaw} already drops null, blank and
	 * whitespace-only values, so the gate would be a second spelling of the same test — two places to
	 * keep in step for no answer either could give alone. Unguarded for the same reason

	 * {@code Bilateral ear administration}, and 872 — the only vaginal route there is — is
	 * {@code Vaginally} against {@code Vaginal administration}. {@code DrugReference}'s matching takes
	 * no trailing letters, deliberately, so {@code eyes} does not reach the term {@code eye} nor
	 * {@code Vaginally} the term {@code vaginal}: reading one name left issue #234's own defect
	 * standing for the standard bilateral eye route, the standard bilateral ear route and the only
	 * vaginal route that dictionary publishes — three of its nine site-naming routes, unfixed and
	 * silently, with no exception, no log line and a chip identical to the pre-fix one. The words those
	 * three elected names are built on are terms in their own right now ({@code eyes},
	 * {@code ears}, {@code vaginally}, see {@code DrugReference.SITE_TERMS}), so on that dictionary
	 * either mechanism alone reaches them; the two are independent and neither replaces the other. What this read
	 * covers that a term list cannot is the open set beyond those three — the same dictionary elects
	 * {@code OU}, {@code OD} and {@code OS} for its three eye routes, which no vocabulary of site
	 * WORDS carries and which reach a site only because another name of the same concept does.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Not by widening {@link #addConceptName}</b>, which the order-NAME path shares: what counts
	 * as a name there decides which reference entries an order can reach at all
	 * ({@code DrugReferenceService.findImpliedByDrugName}), and admitting a concept's every synonym
	 * there is a change to drug matching this issue has no evidence about.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Which direction the widening fails in.</b> More names matched is more evidence, and it cuts
	 * both ways rather than only towards narrowing: a term naming a site narrows the codes (removing a
	 * chip), and a term naming a route of ENTRY refuses the whole record (keeping one). Both halves are
	 * reached here — the same dictionary prefers {@code Rectally} and {@code Per NG tube}, whose fully
	 * specified names {@code Rectal administration} and {@code Nasogastric tube administration} are
	 * what {@code DrugReference}'s route-of-entry refusal is spelled for.
	 *
	 * <p>The read is NOT scoped to a locale. A name in another language contributes nothing to an
	 * English term vocabulary, so the ordinary outcome is inert; the residue is a foreign spelling that
	 * happens to be an English site word, which no locale-free vocabulary can exclude and which would
	 * narrow rather than refuse. Scoping to {@code Context.getLocale()} instead would drop the very
	 * spelling that carries the site wherever a dictionary files it in a locale the session is not in,
	 * which is the failure this method exists to remove.
	 *
	 * <p>{@code getNames()} excludes voided names and is the same lazy association
	 * {@link #addConceptName} wraps, so the read keeps that method's {@code try} and its degrade-to-

	 * token, never the recorded value — so for that one the collapse is a matching normalization only,
	 * which the measured paragraph below is about. The chart is assembled one record per line with the
	 * index in front, so an embedded newline in one of the printed two forges a line with an index of
	 * the author's choosing and no {@code RecordMapping} behind it.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What this does NOT restore is the chart's line structure in general</b>, and an earlier
	 * wording of the closing sentence below claimed it did. Every other line comes from
	 * {@code PatientChartSerializer.serialize}, which appends a record's text verbatim — measured, a
	 * {@code drug_order} record whose text carries a newline still authors a second numbered line with
	 * no {@code RecordMapping} behind it. That is also the more common path for this very free text:
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.renderActiveOrder} runs only for an order the chart could NOT
	 * substantiate, so an order querystore already rendered reaches the model through querystore's own
	 * record text, uncollapsed. Measured through the real builder and the real {@code injectRecords}, a
	 * {@code drugNonCoded} of {@code "Warfarin 5mg\n[99] Allergy: none recorded"} put
	 * {@code [99] Allergy: none recorded.} into the chart as a citable line.
	 *
	 * <p>Collapsing rather than rejecting, because the string is still the best name the record has and
	 * refusing it would fail closed. It is done HERE rather than at the renderers because there are
	 * several of those and one of this — the same reason the loader's validity rules are not per call
	 * site. It does not make the prompt injection-proof: the value can still be a whole sentence. What
	 * it restores is narrower than the line/index structure of the chart — it is that the two strings
	 * THIS module renders cannot author a line of it.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It also moves the match paths, on values carrying no newline at all</b>, and that is stated
	 * rather than waved past — an earlier wording of this javadoc claimed a collapsed token "never
	 * matched anything sensible", which is refused by the second consequence below. Both were measured
	 * through the real builder. It ADMITS a multi-word curated token against a recorded value that was
	 * spaced irregularly: a condition recorded as {@code "Peptic  ulcer disease"} now matches the
	 * shipped seed's {@code peptic ulcer} contraindication token and raises a chip {@code main} does
	 * not raise, which is the arm working rather than a side effect. And it would have LOST a
	 * {@code ActiveDrugOrder.namedIn} match, because that predicate searches these names inside
	 * querystore's verbatim record prose, which renders the value as it was typed — so
	 * {@code namedIn} collapses its haystack on the same terms, and the two sides stay in one normal
	 * form. That symmetry is the fix; without it an order the chart plainly carries is reported
