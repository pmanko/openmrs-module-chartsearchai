/**
 * The one dataset resolution the drug-reference data files use: prefer the file the GP points at
 * (relative to the OpenMRS application data directory), and degrade every failure to an empty list —
 * the drug-reference feature is an additive net that must never break the answer path. Shared so the
 * origin vocabulary, the logging, the exception contract and the {@link DrugReferenceValidity} rule
 * the resolution itself can raise cannot drift between these datasets.
 *
 * <p>Two entry points, differing in ONE thing — whether there is a bundled dataset to take when the
 * operator's file cannot be read. {@link #loadWithClasspathFallback} is for the datasets the module
 * ships one of ({@link JsonDrugReferenceSource}, {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource} and
 * {@link CrossReactivityGroupsLoader}); {@link #loadOperatorFile} is for the one that has none
 * ({@link AtcDrugReferenceSource} — the operator must point at an ATC export they obtained).
 *
 * <p>Until issue #266 the ATC source stayed out of this class altogether and resolved its own file,
 * which is how it came to have no validity channel at all: there was no collector for a rule to be
 * raised into, so issue #156's <em>"the file you configured was not read"</em> was unreachable on the
 * one format most dependent on the operator's own file. The FALLBACK is what it stays out of; the
 * resolution and the rule are shared. The two methods are not expressed in terms of each other on
 * purpose — {@link #loadWithClasspathFallback}'s single collector spans two read attempts and carries a
 * documented misattribution trade that a shared body would have to re-derive, while
 * {@link #loadOperatorFile} has one attempt, so its own window is narrower — see that method, which
 * states what remains of it rather than claiming there is none.

	 * keeps that comment where the two attempts are.
	 *
	 * <p><b>A blank path is skipped SILENTLY</b>, and the guard lives here rather than at each call site
	 * for the reason review found the hard way: extracting this helper first put the guard at one of the

	 *
	 * <p><b>Two states, and only one of them was ever noisy — stated because the first version of this
	 * paragraph said "every untouched install" and that is measurably false.</b> An INSTALLED module
	 * reads the non-blank {@code config.xml} defaults for both path properties, so the resolution is
	 * entered with that path and logs {@code file 'chartsearchai/…' not available}, which
	 * {@link #loadWithClasspathFallback} logged before this helper existed too — unchanged, not new
	 * noise. Blank is what a context carrying no row for the property produces, and what an
	 * administrator who clears the value produces; that is the state this guard is for, and it is the
	 * state {@code CrossReactivityStatusContextTest} drives. The guard is worth keeping on the narrower
	 * claim rather than defended by the broader one, because a rule defended by a false reason is one
	 * measurement away from being deleted along with it.
