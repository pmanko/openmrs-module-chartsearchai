	 * and the bundled curated seed rates none of its rules; ADR Decision 62 carries that census and
	 * the production method that produced it, and is not restated here.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Read this field; do not fall back to parsing {@link #getDetail()}.</b> On the bundled

	 * rating need not be in the detail at all: note and severity are independently authored fields
	 * there, so a rule may carry no note, in which case {@code interactionWarning} appends none, or
	 * carry one whose leading word is a different rating.
	 * {@code ChartSearchAiSafetyWarningSeverityWireTest.theRatingIsPublishedEvenWhereTheProseNamesItNowhere}
	 * drives both of those.

	 * {@link #carriesUnratedRelationship()} for the whole finding, and
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.renderFinding} states the answer in the record the model reads — so
	 * how strongly a safety answer opens now rests on this field, for an INTERACTION finding — and on
	 * it for EVERY such finding the answer addresses rather than for one: where several name the drug
	 * and their clauses disagree, the prompt ranks withholding above a caution, so one Major among
	 * Minors still decides the lead. Only for one TYPE, though: a CONTRAINDICATION states withholding
	 * unconditionally and never consults this value (it carries none — the arms that raise one use the
	 * three-argument constructor), because a recorded allergy is not a caution at any rating. The null
	 * rule above is what carries the most weight where the value IS read: unrated is not low-rated,
	 * and reading it as a caution would soften a curated rule an implementation authored deliberately.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Since issue #337's third round there is a further reader whose answer reaches a
	 * clinician-facing published key</b> — not the only one, this value having reached the wire as
	 * each chip's own {@code severity} since issue #340 — #207 exposed the field for the api-side

	 * reader trims:
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.statableRating},
	 * through {@code DrugReferenceInjector.ratingThisRecordStates}, which carries the rating onto the

	 * ({@code unstatedFindingSeverities}). It asks a different question from every reader above —
	 * whether there is a WORD whose absence means something, rather than how strongly the finding
	 * licenses a call — so do not fold it into the withholding split. Note what the paragraph above

	 * named as the reference data names them. So a finding about a current medication routinely
	 * carries no bridge at all. See {@code DrugSafetyValidator.chartOrderBridges} for what it
	 * withholds and why — it has more than one silence, and since issue #353 more than it had when
	 * this paragraph was written — rather than any summary of it here.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Prompt-facing only.</b> Nothing on the wire moves and the chip's own detail is untouched,
	 * so {@code DrugSafetyValidator.StatedInteractionChips} deliberately does NOT key on it — for the
	 * reason stated at {@link #chartOrderBridges()}, which is NOT that this is unpublished: that key
	 * decides which chips are EMITTED and, through {@code ChartSearchAiUtils.resourceKey}, whether two
	 * injected findings share one resource uuid, so a fact like this must not be able to change which
	 * chips exist, whether or not a client can read it. The published-versus-prompt-facing reading of
	 * it was falsified by issue #347 and again by #374, and the key's own membership contradicts it in
	 * both directions — {@code carriesUnratedRelationship()} is in the key and unpublished, while
	 * {@link #restsOnAnUncorroboratedChartMatch()} is in it and published. That membership says what the
	 * key is NOT sorted by and nothing about this ledger's behaviour: every chip it sees comes from
	 * {@link #interaction}, which hardcodes that flag false, so the term is constant there. Leaving it out costs nothing
	 * observable, and that is worth saying rather than leaving to be re-derived: the flag is constant
	 * within an arm, and where the two interaction arms can both run in one pass — the POST-answer
	 * pass, where a drug the ANSWER named is in play beside a screening question —
	 * {@code InteractionPairs.alreadyReported} already stops the screening arm restating a pair the
	 * drug-in-play arm reported, before this ledger sees it. So no two chips of one pass can differ by
	 * this flag alone.

	 *
	 *         <p>Read by {@code DrugReferenceInjector}, which resolves each uuid to the number of the

	 *         SENTENCE is printed ({@code ContraindicationChips}, issue #146), so the records named here
	 *         have to be evidence for the sentence this finding actually states rather than for one that

	 *         allergen — {@code RecordedAllergen.alsoRecordedIn} being what carries the records across

	 *         {@link #chartOrderBridges()} — that one is prose the model reads and so needs a
	 *         deterministic wire home of its own, while this is a pointer the citation list publishes.
	 *         ADR Decision 80 carries that argument.

	/**
	 * One substance this chip names, and one active order of this patient's that the module resolved it
	 * from — the pair {@code DrugReferenceInjector.FINDING_CHART_ORDER_LEAD}'s items are rendered from.
	 *
	 * <p>A value class with {@link #equals} and {@link #hashCode}. <b>{@code equals} has TWO readers,
	 * both exercised.</b> The first is {@code DrugSafetyValidator.addChartOrderBridge}'s
	 * {@code out.contains(bridge)} — an {@code ArrayList}, so that resolves to {@code equals} and never
	 * to {@code hashCode}. Since issue #347 published this list there is a SECOND exercised reader,
	 * {@code ChartSearchAiSafetyWarningSeverityWireTest}'s accessor-versus-key comparison, whose
	 * {@code Objects.equals} falls through to {@code AbstractList.equals} and walks the elements of
	 * that fixture's bridged chip. It was not exercised when this list was first published — every
	 * chip in that fixture bridged nothing, so two empty lists compared equal without touching an
	 * element — and the chip that closed it was added for exactly that reason; ADR Decision 70 is the
	 * record. {@code hashCode} has NO reader (Jackson serializes
	 * through the getters below, not through either) and is here only to hold the contract with
	 * {@code equals}. The first of those two readers is the
	 * de-duplication that makes two orders of one display state their substance once, pinned by
	 * {@code InteractionFindingChartOrderBridgeTest.twoOrdersOfTheSameDisplayAreNamedOnce}. Said
	 * precisely because an earlier draft named the chip COLLAPSE as the reason and that is false (it
	 * does not key on this list): a maintainer checking that reason, finding it false and deleting these
	 * methods would leave the list identity-compared and print one substance twice inside a citable
	 * record. That is also NOT a licence to give {@link SafetyWarning} itself an {@code equals}: it has
	 * none so that nothing DOWNSTREAM can collapse chips this module meant to keep apart
	 * ({@code InteractionRouteVariantTest}).
	 *
	 * <p>Both fields are strings a record PRINTS. {@code substance} is the name the chip already
	 * says — never a second answer to which name to print — and {@code orderDisplay} is the order's own
	 * display, which is the string a chart record of that order carries wherever the order has a drug
	 * row WITH A NON-BLANK NAME — querystore falls back to the concept where it does not, and
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.displaysANameOfAny} records the shapes that diverge there.
	 *
	 * <p><b>{@link #toString()} is the only reader that PRINTS them as one string</b>, and the
	 * PROMPT-side renderer must keep taking that spelling, so that the pair a debug dump prints and
	 * the pair a model reads cannot differ. <b>Since issue #379 the model can read one thing MORE</b>: on an
	 * install that sets {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.citeOrderRecords},
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.chartOrderClause} appends the number of the chart record the order
	 * is, to this string rather than into it, which is why that issue changed nothing here. So there the
	 * two agree about the PAIR and no longer about the whole item — do not close that gap by moving the
	 * number in, which would put a prompt-side index on the wire keys issue #347 fixed. The two getters beside it are the WIRE's (issue #347) and
	 * exist so that a client is handed two fields rather than a sentence to parse — the same reason
	 * issue #340 publishes {@code severity} instead of leaving a client to substring-match
	 * {@link SafetyWarning#getDetail()}. They are named {@code getSubstance} rather than
	 * {@code getSubstanceName} deliberately: the latter would shadow
	 * {@link DrugReference#getSubstanceName()}, which means the dataset's substance-name FIELD and not
	 * a printed label.
