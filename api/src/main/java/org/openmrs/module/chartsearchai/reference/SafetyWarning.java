	 * An INTERACTION chip's warning, and the only shape that can carry
	 * {@link #reconciledPartnerNoteName} (issue #297). A FACTORY rather than a wider PUBLIC
	 * constructor, for the reason {@link #contraindication} states of its own flag: these facts travel
	 * together only for an interaction chip, and a constructor offering them beside
	 * {@code uncorroboratedChartMatch} would offer a caller a combination that has no meaning. No
	 * ordinal is given for the argument it replaces — the private constructor's width moves whenever a
	 * fact is added (it did at issue #349), and the point is which SHAPE may set what. They are
	 * not the same fact and do not arrive together: only the drug-in-play arm can FOLD, so only its
	 * chips carry {@code unratedRelationship}, while since issue #339 both active-order arms set a
	 * reconciled name. Only the drug-in-play arm's is READ today — {@code DrugReferenceInjector}
	 * reaches this accessor from the loop over the entries a question put in play, and a screening
	 * question puts none in play by its own gate — so the screening arm's is set for the shape rather
	 * than for a consumer, which is what stops a later reader having to remember to set it.
	 *
	 * <p>Package-private, matching the accessors: a caller may set only what it may read back. The
	 * public constructors above are public because the wire-facing shape is, and
	 * neither of these two facts is part of it — public here would offer an outside caller a way to
	 * govern the injected record's strength, and the name of a partner in it, with no way to observe
	 * either assertion from where it was made. The one caller is
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.interactionWarning} — which is <b>not</b> the only place an interaction
	 * chip is built, and saying so would be false: the class-only chip inside
	 * {@code addInteractionWarnings} itself is built by {@link #classOnlyInteraction}, and
	 * {@code addQuestionPairInteractions} builds one from a public constructor. Neither can fold, so
	 * neither has either of these facts to carry, and both
	 * answer false/null by construction rather than by remembering to — the same argument
	 * {@link #contraindication} makes for the allergen arm's three sentences. This factory replaced a
	 * five-argument package-private CONSTRUCTOR that carried {@code unratedRelationship} alone; that
	 * constructor is gone rather than left unreachable beside this, because a second way in is a second
	 * way for the two facts to be set apart.
	 *
	 * @param unratedRelationship whether this warning also asserts a relationship the source rates
	 *        nothing for — see {@link #carriesUnratedRelationship()}
	 * @param reconciledRule the rule this chip's partner was reconciled on, or null when nothing
	 *        reconciled
	 * @param reconciledNoteName see {@link #reconciledPartnerNoteName} — null when the reconciliation

	 * {@code putSafetyChips} payload writer, and since issue #280 the {@code alerts} array of
	 * {@code GET /chartsearchai/chartalerts}, which reaches that same serializer WITHOUT
	 * {@code putSafetyChips} because it carries no answer to state an interaction extent about.
	 * The field is therefore read the same way on every surface — always present, {@code null} on a
	 * contraindication, which is what every standing alert is. Verbatim and UNNORMALIZED, which is
	 * deliberate rather than lazy: the field is the dataset's rating, and coercing it would put the
	 * wire at odds with the very prose a client is being told to stop parsing. What it publishes is the
	 * SOURCE's rating, not this module's judgment about what may be done — which is the separate thing
	 * issue #283 keeps off the wire ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.licensesWithholding} and the
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.STRENGTH_*} clauses are prompt-facing only).
	 *
	 * <p><b>A non-null value is NOT a guarantee the module recognises it, so it does not mean "the
	 * source rated this".</b> {@code DrugSafetyValidator.severityRank} trims and lower-cases, and maps
	 * every value it does not recognise — including null — to the same answer, UNRATED: exempt from
	 * {@code clearsSeverityFloor}, sorted above {@code Major} by {@code severityPriority}, and
	 * licensing withholding in {@code ratingLicensesWithholding}. So there are three classes on the

	 * plain Jackson-bound string with no vocabulary check and no {@code DrugReferenceValidity} rule
	 * over it, so an operator's {@code json} dataset supplies its own words. A reader comparing this
	 * value should trim and case-fold as {@code severityRank} does, and treat anything it does not
	 * recognise as unrated rather than as a floor. The shipped DDInter dataset publishes exactly
	 * {@code Major}, {@code Moderate}, {@code Minor} and {@code Unknown}, none null and none blank,
	 * and the bundled curated seed rates none of its rules; ADR Decision 62 carries that census and
	 * the production method that produced it, and is not restated here.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Read this field; do not fall back to parsing {@link #getDetail()}.</b> On the bundled
	 * DDInter dataset the rating is somewhere in that prose: {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource.noteFor}
	 * builds every note as {@code severity + ". " + mechanism}, or as
	 * {@code severity + " severity interaction (… no mechanism description on file)."} where the row
	 * has none, and {@code DrugSafetyValidator.interactionWarning} appends that note. Measured
	 * 2026-08-30 over the shipped KB's 590,312 links: no note is null or blank, no rated rule carries
	 * none, and none fails to start with its own severity word.
	 *
	 * <p><b>That measurement is about the NOTE, and no claim about where the rating sits in the
	 * rendered detail follows from it.</b> Three attempts to state one have been refuted, which is why
	 * none is made here. The detail is assembled from chart text as well as dataset text, and the
	 * chart's half goes in unquoted — a free-text prescription display can carry the very delimiter
	 * the chip appends its note after, which
	 * {@code NonCodedDrugOrderNameTest.aFreeTextDisplayIsPrintedIntoTheChipUnquoted} pins as current
	 * behaviour. What is left, and is enough, is that {@code detail} is prose this module rewords
	 * freely and holds out as no contract. And on an operator {@code sourceFormat=json} dataset the
	 * rating need not be in the detail at all: note and severity are independently authored fields
	 * there, so a rule may carry no note, in which case {@code interactionWarning} appends none, or
	 * carry one whose leading word is a different rating.
	 * {@code ChartSearchAiSafetyWarningSeverityWireTest.theRatingIsPublishedEvenWhereTheProseNamesItNowhere}
	 * drives both of those.
	 *
	 * <p>Since issue #283 this value has a second reader, and it decides more than an order:
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.ratingLicensesWithholding} splits it into "a reason to withhold" and
	 * "a caution to note", {@code licensesWithholding(SafetyWarning)} composes that with
	 * {@link #carriesUnratedRelationship()} for the whole finding, and
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.renderFinding} states the answer in the record the model reads — so
	 * how strongly a safety answer opens now rests on this field, for an INTERACTION finding — and on
	 * it for EVERY such finding the answer addresses rather than for one: where several name the drug
	 * and their clauses disagree, the prompt ranks withholding above a caution, so one Major among
	 * Minors still decides the lead. Only for one TYPE, though: a CONTRAINDICATION states withholding
	 * unconditionally and never consults this value (it carries none — the arms that raise one use the
	 * three-argument constructor), because a recorded allergy is not a caution at any rating. The null
	 * rule above is what carries the most weight where the value IS read: unrated is not low-rated,
	 * and reading it as a caution would soften a curated rule an implementation authored deliberately.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Since issue #337's third round there is a further reader whose answer reaches a
	 * clinician-facing published key</b> — not the only one, this value having reached the wire as
	 * each chip's own {@code severity} since issue #340 — #207 exposed the field for the api-side
	 * ordering and scoped itself to that, as the paragraph above says — raw and untrimmed where that
	 * reader trims:
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.statableRating},
	 * through {@code DrugReferenceInjector.ratingThisRecordStates}, which carries the rating onto the
	 * injected record's mapping so a check can ask whether the ANSWER stated it
	 * ({@code unstatedFindingSeverities}). It asks a different question from every reader above —
	 * whether there is a WORD whose absence means something, rather than how strongly the finding
	 * licenses a call — so do not fold it into the withholding split. Note what the paragraph above
	 * refuses to claim about WHERE the rating sits in the rendered detail: that reader is exactly the

	 * on this flag; <b>ADR Decision 44 is canonical for what that costs</b> and the measurements are
	 * not restated here, because three copies of a rejected-alternative argument is how this repo has
	 * come to contradict itself before.

	 * #309 — for a CONDITION rule whose matched record carries the token only inside a longer word
	 * ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.aMatchedConditionCarriesTheToken}). A class-token rule and every
	 * allergen-arm sentence still answer false.
	 *
	 * <p><b>So this is no longer scoped as the chip's own demotion is, and the divergence is
	 * deliberate</b>: {@code DrugSafetyValidator.contraindicationRank} stays allergy-typed, because
	 * issue #223 scoped it to the fold whose premise is that a self-named rule reports the allergen
	 * arm's fact — a premise a condition rule has no part in. Stated here because this accessor is
	 * where a reader would come to learn the two scopes had parted. ADR Decision 73's trade-offs carry
	 * the reproduction and why tightening the match is not the remedy.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Published VERBATIM since issue #374, as each chip's {@code restsOnAnUncorroboratedChartMatch}
	 * wire key — so this accessor's name IS the key</b>, the rule {@link #chartOrderBridges()} carries
	 * for its own. Public for that reason and no other: the wire-facing shape is public, and since #374
	 * this fact is part of it. The SETTER is not: {@link #contraindication} is the only caller that may
	 * set it, and it stays package-private, since a provenance answer is a measurement this module made
	 * and not a value an outside caller may assert. The class's setter/accessor symmetry rule is
	 * one-directional, so a public read over a package-private write does not breach it.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What the published {@code false} does NOT say is that the chart corroborates the finding.</b>
	 * This is the ONE home of what it covers, and no count of those readings is published — it was, and
	 * the count went stale inside two cycles. A {@code false} arises from: either fold above; a chip
	 * that answers by construction, never having had a rule to match (each interaction, class-only and
	 * overdose chip, and the allergen arm's own three sentences); and — the reading easiest to miss,
	 * because it is a curated contraindication chip like the corroborated one —
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.corroboratedByTheChart} answering true UNCONDITIONALLY for a curated
	 * allergy rule that is not self-named, so a CLASS-token rule's chip publishes false without the
	 * chart having been asked. That last is reachable on the module's own bundled seed, whose
	 * class-token rules are {@code nsaid}, {@code penicillin} and {@code aminoglycoside} — one
	 * {@code sourceFormat=json} flip away, and not only on an operator's file. No ranking of these
	 * readings against each other is offered: nothing has measured one. {@code README.md} carries this
	 * for a client.
	 * Before #374 this read "not serialized; the wire shape is unchanged", and the hazard case was the
	 * chip asserting the contraindication while the two records beside it hedged — the chip now states

	 * property {@code CLAUDE.md} states {@code partnerLabel} exists to hold. The name travels HERE, on
	 * the chip that decided it, rather than being re-derived by the injector, because
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.injectRecords} already runs the whole fold once through
	 * {@code preAnswerFindings}: a second walk is the two-resolutions-that-agree shape issue #151
	 * forbids, and its failure mode is silent and one-directional.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It is the RECORD's own vocabulary</b> — the dataset's {@code getName()} where the dataset has
	 * a name for the partner it has PROVED is the rule's, the rule's own token everywhere else — and never
	 * {@link DrugReference#displayLabel()}. On the rung where the ladder found no name the two surfaces
	 * do end up on one string, which is not a counterexample: they agree there because both take the
	 * rule's token, not because this one took the chip's. The chip's name can be
	 * {@code displayLabel()}, which may not enter this record's prose
	 * ({@code DrugSafetyChipLabelTest.displayLabelNeverLeaksIntoTheRenderedRecordText}), so the two
	 * surfaces name one SUBSTANCE in each one's own vocabulary rather than sharing one string —
	 * {@code Acetylsalicylic acid} in the note beside {@code Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin)} in the
	 * chip. Which name that is, per reconciliation outcome, is stated on
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.reconciledPartnerName} — which since issue #339 answers for every rule
	 * chip and not only for a folded one, so this field is non-null on chips that carry no class
	 * sentence at all.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The rule is an argument and not a convenience.</b> A note may take this name only where it
	 * is about the very rule the fold was decided on: the record collapses its notes to one per partner
	 * over ONE row ({@code DrugReferenceInjector.onePerPartner}) while the chip chose its rule across
	 * every row of the substance ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.bestRulePerPartner}), so the two can elect
	 * different rules for one partner. Answering null there leaves the note exactly where it was, so
	 * this can only REMOVE a divergence and never create one. Asked here rather than left to the
	 * caller for the reason issue #298 gives of {@code OrderPartner.recordNameSource}: a reader that
	 * had to remember the check is a reader that can forget it.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It does TWO jobs and only the second is a fail-safe.</b> Its first is to scope the name to
	 * the note it was decided for at all: {@code DrugReferenceInjector.reconciledPartnerNoteName} is a
	 * linear scan that asks every finding of this response, so weakened to {@code rule != null} the
	 * FIRST reconciled name in that list answers for every note in the record. The ticket's own
	 * reproducer then renders lisinopril's Moderate interaction as
	 * {@code Acetylsalicylic acid (Moderate)} — one partner's interaction under another's name, in text
	 * the prompt carries as a citable record, with nothing thrown and no count changed.
	 * {@code OneNameAcrossChipAndInjectedRecordTest.aReconciledNameReachesOnlyTheNoteItWasDecidedFor}
	 * pins it, and was the one api case to redden on that weakening when it was made — mutate the
	 * conjunct and read the failures rather than trusting this sentence.
	 *
	 * <p>Its second job is the fail-safe, and THAT is what nothing pins: the record collapses over ONE
	 * row while the chip chose across every row of the substance, so where the two elect different
	 * rules for one partner this answers null and the note stays where it was. No fixture reaches that
	 * shape ({@code ddinter} writes every rule's token and ATC from one partner row, so a label group's
	 * rows do not differ on either field — the same premise
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.onePerPartner} records) and a hand-authored {@code json} dataset
	 * reaches it immediately. Whoever fixtures it should assert this condition, not assume it.
	 *
	 * <p>Not serialized — the note name is the injected record's, and no key
	 * {@code ChartSearchAiRestController.serializeSafetyWarnings} writes carries it; the chip's own

	 *
	 * <p><b>It is a RESOLUTION and not an identity</b>, which is what keeps it clear of #339's reverted
	 * rounds 5-6: {@code DrugReferenceInjector.FINDING_CHART_ORDER_LEAD} carries that argument, and the

	 * <p><b>Established by the arm that raised the warning, never re-derived.</b> The two

	 * is a current-medication finding beside the drug-in-play arm's proposal findings where the drug in
	 * play is not hers, which the issue's decision accepted (ADR Decision 116). The DRUG-IN-PLAY arm

	 * she takes — a recorded name of hers names its substance, or puts it in play alone; a code of hers the
	 * data files under it alone; or a concept of hers the dataset's bridge files it under by a name naming
	 * it — and false where they do not (issue #402, ADR Decision 123). That includes a substance her orders
	 * resolve to only as one of several readings: her {@code Nexium 40mg} resolves to omeprazole and

	 * the dose check's {@link #overdose} included: one finding in the other column beside the rest is the
	 * one-site shape issue #402 recorded and reverted. A drug her
	 * chart holds only as an ended order is not in that resolution, so it answers false and carries
	 * {@link #isAboutAnEndedOrder()}'s referent instead (issue #472). The QUESTION-PAIR arm answers false
	 * by construction: both its drugs are ones the question named.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It can answer differently in the two {@code validate} passes of one request, and the wire
	 * publishes the second.</b> The pre-answer pass validates with an EMPTY answer, so the drugs in play
	 * there are the QUESTION's — the base for the record the model reads before it answers, and the only
	 * pass a clause is rendered from ({@code DrugReferenceInjector.renderFinding} has one caller,
	 * {@code injectRecords}, and it uses the pre-answer findings). The chips an answer carries come from
	 * the second pass, which is not the same on every path. {@code LlmInferenceService.search} and
	 * {@code searchStreaming} hand it the MODEL's answer, and a drug the answer names is in play there
	 * beside the question's unless a record the answer is attributable to already names it
	 * ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.isEchoOfAttributableRecord}); the injected record of every finding the
	 * first pass raised names that finding's drug, and the attributable records include the module's own
	 * reference records, cited or not. {@code answerFromTheModule} hands it the EMPTY answer, as the pass
	 * that raised the findings had. The ways the two passes' answers can still differ are not listed here:
	 * two lists written here were each found incomplete. Nothing compares the two passes' warnings; ADR
	 * Decision 118 records the divergence as a residue.
	 * Said here because a reader checking for pass-stability will look for it.
	 *
	 * <p>It is not derivable from anything else the warning carries, which is why it travels. In
	 * particular it is NOT {@link #chartOrderBridges()}, which answers a RESOLUTION question — which of
	 * the patient's own orders each named substance was resolved from, and whether the sentence naming
	 * one may be printed at all. Do not read the two as near-neighbours on the strength of both being
	 * about active orders: that list is empty wherever the order's own recorded names reach the
	 * substance, which is the common case and is this issue's own reproduction, where both orders are
	 * named as the reference data names them. So a finding about a current medication routinely
	 * carries no bridge at all. See {@code DrugSafetyValidator.chartOrderBridges} for what it
	 * withholds and why — it has more than one silence, and since issue #353 more than it had when
	 * this paragraph was written — rather than any summary of it here.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Published VERBATIM since issue #527, as each chip's {@code aboutACurrentMedication} wire key

	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.StatedInteractionChips} still does NOT key on it — for the reason stated
	 * at {@link #chartOrderBridges()}, which is NOT that this is unpublished: that key decides which
	 * chips are EMITTED and, through {@code ChartSearchAiUtils.resourceKey}, whether two
	 * injected findings share one resource uuid, so a fact like this must not be able to change which
	 * chips exist, whether or not a client can read it. The published-versus-prompt-facing reading of
	 * it was falsified by issue #347 and again by #374, and the key's own membership contradicts it in
	 * both directions — {@code carriesUnratedRelationship()} is in the key and unpublished, while
	 * {@link #restsOnAnUncorroboratedChartMatch()} is in it and published. That membership says what the
	 * key is NOT sorted by and nothing about this ledger's behaviour: every chip it sees comes from
	 * {@link #interaction}, which hardcodes that flag false, so the term is constant there. Leaving it out costs nothing
	 * observable, and that is worth saying rather than leaving to be re-derived: the flag is constant
	 * within an arm for one subject, and where the two interaction arms can both run in one pass — the POST-answer

	 *         #379 attributes on its own path), the context states no provenance, or the module could
	 *         read no allergy or condition rows — and the injector's own refusals add more. The whole
	 *         list is enumerated in one place, {@code RecordMapping.getDerivedFrom()}; a non-empty
	 *         answer here does NOT mean a non-empty one there.
	 *
	 *         <p>Read by {@code DrugReferenceInjector}, which resolves each uuid to the number of the
	 *         chart record it IS and puts those numbers on the injected {@code safety_finding} mapping,
	 *         so a client reaches the source record whether or not the model cited it.
	 *
	 *         <p><b>Fixed when the warning is built, and deliberately NOT unioned over the collapsed
	 *         contraindication key.</b> A key can collapse two rules and only the ledger's rank winner's
	 *         SENTENCE is printed ({@code ContraindicationChips}, issue #146), so the records named here
	 *         have to be evidence for the sentence this finding actually states rather than for one that
	 *         was discarded. What IS unioned is the other direction — two chart rows spelling one
	 *         allergy, which {@code DrugSafetyValidator.resolvedAlike} folds into one recorded
	 *         allergen — {@code RecordedAllergen.alsoRecordedIn} being what carries the records across
	 *         that fold, as {@code alsoNames} carries the naming — and either row is a record of the
	 *         fact the surviving sentence states.
	 *
	 *         <p>Package-private, matching the two factories that set it: a caller may set only what it
	 *         may read back. Not part of the wire-facing chip shape, unlike
	 *         {@link #chartOrderBridges()} — that one is prose the model reads and so needs a
	 *         deterministic wire home of its own, while this is a pointer the citation list publishes.
	 *         ADR Decision 80 carries that argument.

	/**
	 * One substance this chip names, and one active order of this patient's that the module resolved it
	 * from — the pair {@code DrugReferenceInjector.FINDING_CHART_ORDER_LEAD}'s items are rendered from.
	 *
	 * <p>A value class with {@link #equals} and {@link #hashCode}. <b>{@code equals} has TWO readers,
	 * both exercised.</b> The first is {@code DrugSafetyValidator.addChartOrderBridge}'s
	 * {@code out.contains(bridge)} — an {@code ArrayList}, so that resolves to {@code equals} and never
	 * to {@code hashCode}. Since issue #347 published this list there is a SECOND exercised reader,
	 * {@code ChartSearchAiSafetyWarningSeverityWireTest}'s accessor-versus-key comparison, whose
	 * {@code Objects.equals} falls through to {@code AbstractList.equals} and walks the elements of
	 * that fixture's bridged chip. It was not exercised when this list was first published — every
	 * chip in that fixture bridged nothing, so two empty lists compared equal without touching an
	 * element — and the chip that closed it was added for exactly that reason; ADR Decision 70 is the
	 * record. {@code hashCode} has NO reader (Jackson serializes
	 * through the getters below, not through either) and is here only to hold the contract with
	 * {@code equals}. The first of those two readers is the
	 * de-duplication that makes two orders of one display state their substance once, pinned by
	 * {@code InteractionFindingChartOrderBridgeTest.twoOrdersOfTheSameDisplayAreNamedOnce}. Said
	 * precisely because an earlier draft named the chip COLLAPSE as the reason and that is false (it
	 * does not key on this list): a maintainer checking that reason, finding it false and deleting these
	 * methods would leave the list identity-compared and print one substance twice inside a citable
	 * record. That is also NOT a licence to give {@link SafetyWarning} itself an {@code equals}: it has
	 * none so that nothing DOWNSTREAM can collapse chips this module meant to keep apart
	 * ({@code InteractionRouteVariantTest}).
	 *
	 * <p>Both fields are strings a record PRINTS. {@code substance} is the name the chip already
	 * says — never a second answer to which name to print — and {@code orderDisplay} is the order's own
	 * display, which is the string a chart record of that order carries wherever the order has a drug
	 * row WITH A NON-BLANK NAME — querystore falls back to the concept where it does not, and
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.displaysANameOfAny} records the shapes that diverge there.
	 *
	 * <p><b>{@link #toString()} is the only reader that PRINTS them as one string</b>, and the
	 * PROMPT-side renderer must keep taking that spelling, so that the pair a debug dump prints and
	 * the pair a model reads cannot differ. <b>Since issue #379 the model can read one thing MORE</b>: on an
	 * install that sets {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.citeOrderRecords},
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.chartOrderClause} appends the number of the chart record the order
	 * is, to this string rather than into it, which is why that issue changed nothing here. So there the
	 * two agree about the PAIR and no longer about the whole item — do not close that gap by moving the
	 * number in, which would put a prompt-side index on the wire keys issue #347 fixed. The two getters beside it are the WIRE's (issue #347) and
	 * exist so that a client is handed two fields rather than a sentence to parse — the same reason
	 * issue #340 publishes {@code severity} instead of leaving a client to substring-match
	 * {@link SafetyWarning#getDetail()}. They are named {@code getSubstance} rather than
	 * {@code getSubstanceName} deliberately: the latter would shadow
	 * {@link DrugReference#getSubstanceName()}, which means the dataset's substance-name FIELD and not
	 * a printed label.
