/**
 * Serializes an entire patient chart into numbered records for direct LLM inference.
 * Each record is prefixed with a sequential number (e.g. [1]) to minimize
 * token usage. The mapping from number back to resource type and ID is returned
 * alongside the text.
 *
 * <p>This class adds record timestamps as parenthetical citation labels
 * (e.g. {@code "(2024-01-15)"}) to the record text supplied by the caller
 * (querystore's serialized documents) — metadata for the LLM to reason about
 * chronology. Every dated record carries its own date on its own line, by default (issue #528).
 * Run-length compression — the date rendered on the first record of each consecutive same-date
 * run and dropped on the rest (#66) — is still available through
 * {@link #serialize(Patient, List, Set, boolean, boolean)}, but no production path asks for it:
 * a same-date follow-on line looks exactly like a record that has no date, and the model reads
 * it that way (ADR Decision 122). The {@link RecordMapping} text always retains the inline date
 * either way, so the grounding verifier can still resolve a cited date.
 *
 * <p>It also states, on a drug-order record whose order the chart builder could resolve, whether
 * that order is in force ({@link #ACTIVE_ORDER_LABEL} / {@link #INACTIVE_ORDER_LABEL}, issue #317).
 * querystore's rendered text cannot say: it renders no marker at all for an order that lapsed by its
 * {@code auto_expire_date}, so such a prescription would otherwise reach the model byte-shaped
 * exactly like one still being taken.
 *
 * <p>It also appends an obs-group label (e.g. {@code "(part of: Basic metabolic panel)"})
 * after the body of any record that carries obs-group metadata, so the LLM can cluster
 * the atomic members of a lab panel / vital-signs set — see {@link #groupMembershipLabel}.
 *
 * <p>Finally, the trailing {@code ".0"} OpenMRS adds to whole-number obs values is trimmed
 * (e.g. {@code "988.0"} → {@code "988"}) to save further prompt tokens — value-lossless and
 * scoped so a {@code ".0"} inside a code or version (e.g. ICD-10 {@code "E11.0"},
 * {@code "1.0.0"}) is preserved. See {@link #trimTrailingZeroDecimals}.

	 * What a drug-order record's line says when the module has read the patient's orders and this
	 * one is among the active ones, and when it is not (issue #317).
	 *
	 * <p><strong>The wording is a measured decision, and the measurement is why these two strings and
	 * not the obvious ones.</strong> Five wordings were run on the host standalone
	 * ({@code chartMode=fullChart}, drug reference on), n=3 per cell, each sample separated by a
	 * question on another patient so it re-prefills instead of measuring llama's KV prefix cache
	 * (issue #315's methodology finding). The cell: patient {@code a7090f70}, whose Simvastatin order
	 * lapsed by its {@code auto_expire_date} while a Bupivacaine and a Lidocaine order are live,
	 * asked <em>"what medications is the patient taking?"</em>. Every arm was stable 3/3.
	 *
	 * <p>{@code ". Active order: yes/no"} (this feature's first wording), {@code ". Active: yes/no"},
	 * {@code ". Status: active/inactive"} and {@code ". Order status: active/not active"} all answered
	 * <em>"No active medications are recorded"</em> — a denial of two live prescriptions, which is a
	 * false negative in the dangerous direction and the issue #118 self-contradiction sentence
	 * verbatim, since the same payload carries two safety chips naming those very two drugs. These
	 * two strings answered <em>"The patient is currently taking Bupivacaine [3] and Lidocaine [4]"</em>,
	 * citing both.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>The last two arms are the discriminator, and they are why this is a diagnosis rather
	 * than a lucky string.</strong> They share the field name, the frame and the position, and differ
	 * only in the value token — and it is the arm whose value is "active" that denies. The negative
	 * mark's own word was being lifted into the model's absent-data sentence, whose template
	 * ({@code LlmProvider}: "name what is missing", "No alcohol use is recorded.") has nothing to
	 * borrow from "not in force". That is issue #110's failure class reaching a FIELD, which is what
	 * this javadoc used to argue a field was safe from. What the wording does NOT decide is whether
	 * the model reads the two live records at all: base — no mark anywhere — answers this same cell
	 * <em>"The patient is taking Simvastatin Co 20mg [8]"</em> 3/3, naming the lapsed drug and citing
	 * neither live one. The model overlooks those two records on this question shape either way; the
	 * wording decides what it then says about the record it does read.
	 *
	 * <p>What did not move across the five, and what this wording costs. <em>"is he currently taking
	 * any medications?"</em> on the same patient is answered correctly by every one of them
	 * (Bupivacaine and Lidocaine, the lapsed Simvastatin excluded, 3/3 each) where base includes the
	 * lapsed drug — so no arm was chosen at that cell's expense. The cost is on the
	 * one-stopped-order patient ({@code 21580018}) asked the same "what medications" question:
	 * {@code ". Active order: no"} answered <em>"No active medications are recorded. The record for
	 * Nevirapine shows it was stopped on 2026-08-24 [1]"</em> and this wording answers <em>"No active
	 * medications are recorded."</em> — the same verdict, without the cited record behind it.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>Since issue #315 the negative string has a SECOND consumer: the system prompt.</strong>
	 * {@code LlmProvider.DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT} composes {@link #INACTIVE_ORDER_LABEL} into the rule
	 * telling the model that an answer naming a drug from such a record must say the order is no
	 * longer in force. It composes the CONSTANT, so a rename carries into the prompt automatically and
	 * cannot leave it teaching a token no record carries. A rename is NOT silent — the case named
	 * below reddens on it — but what that case shows is a changed MARK, not a changed prompt rule, and
	 * nothing can show the latter: both sides of {@code prompt.contains(INACTIVE_ORDER_LABEL)} are the
	 * same inlined constant and move together. So the red is the signal to re-run BOTH A/Bs; the one
	 * in this javadoc and Decision 47's are separate ledgers and neither transfers to the other.
	 *
	 * <p>A change to either string is a change to what every chart says to the model, and needs its
	 * own interleaved A/B before it ships; the measurement above is what one looks like, and issue
	 * #315's five-wording attempt at a prompt rule is the other reason to expect one word to matter.
	 * {@code DrugOrderCurrencyMarkTest.theTwoMarksAreSpelledExactlyAsMeasured} pins both as literals,
	 * so such a change has to redden a test rather than being made by accident; every other assertion
	 * compares the constant to itself and cannot see a rename. ADR Decision 46 carries this same
	 * ledger in the durable record, beside what the mark costs the {@code fullChart} KV-reuse
	 * invariant and the one end-to-end effect nobody has measured.
	 *
	 * <p>Three things it says on purpose. It reports {@code Order.isActive()} and nothing more — the
	 * module's own authoritative predicate, and the same question the drug-safety layer asks of the
	 * same data — except for an order that has not started, which since issue #553 carries
	 * {@link #SCHEDULED_ORDER_LABEL} instead of either value. Not, however, through the same call: the safety layer screens on
	 * {@code getActiveOrders}, which evaluates the predicate in SQL. They agree on every leg checked
	 * and differ where {@code Order.isActive()} throws and the SQL answers, which
	 * {@code QueryStoreChartBuilder.readingOf} handles per order — so "the chart and the chips cannot
	 * disagree" is a claim about the two predicates, and it is not enforced by their sharing a call
	 * site, because they do not share one. It is enforced by a case:
	 * {@code DrugOrderCurrencyMarkTest.theTwoPredicatesTheModuleAsksAgreeOnEveryOrderEitherCanEvaluate}
	 * drives both over one patient's whole drug-order list and asserts they classify each order
	 * alike, excluding — and asserting — the throwing row. It says "not in force"
	 * rather than "ended" or "stopped", because absence from the active set is not a claim about a
	 * stop date — an order whose {@code dateActivated} is in the future is not in force either — and
	 * is not a claim about whether the patient is taking anything. It deliberately does NOT borrow the
	 * noun {@code DrugReferenceInjector.renderActiveOrder} uses ("Active drug order:"), which the
	 * first wording did, on the reasoning that one vocabulary per axis beats two. That reasoning is
	 * still sound and it lost to the measurement above. So the model can see a trailing
	 * {@code ". Order status: not in force"} field on one record and a leading "Active drug order:"
	 * record type on another, and nothing here makes the prompt uniform on that axis. And it is a
	 * plain field in querystore's own
	 * {@code ". Label: value"} idiom rather than a sentence, because issue #110 measured that prose
	 * inside a record gets recited into the answer as though it were clinical content — necessary,
	 * and now known not to be sufficient: a field's VALUE gets recited too.
	 *
	 * <p>Being recited is the POINT here, which is what separates this from issue #117 and the rule
	 * {@code README} draws from it — that a field belongs beside the citation rather than inside the
	 * record, because everything in a record's text is quotable. What #117 forbids in the text is the
	 * module's own BOOKKEEPING (a truncation counter, a dataset attribution), which a clinician-facing
	 * answer should never carry. Whether a prescription is in force is a fact about the patient's
	 * record, and an answer that repeats it is doing the right thing — repeating it about the record it
	 * is on. What the measurement above adds is that the same readability lets a negative value be
	 * repeated about the WHOLE chart, which is why the value's own words are part of the decision and
	 * not only the field's. The same answer also rides
	 * structurally on {@link RecordMapping#getOrderActive()}, for the consumer that needs to branch on
	 * it rather than read it. That field is deliberately not published on the wire — not because a
	 * client could derive it (the wire carries no record text at all, only the citation's index, type,
	 * uuid, date, grounding verdict, group, source and withheld count), but because a client
	 * navigates to the order itself by {@code resourceUuid} and reads its status from the chart, which
	 * is authoritative and current in a way a copy taken at answer time would not be.
