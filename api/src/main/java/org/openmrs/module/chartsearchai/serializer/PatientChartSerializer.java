/**
 * Serializes an entire patient chart into numbered records for direct LLM inference.
 * Each record is prefixed with a sequential number (e.g. [1]) to minimize
 * token usage. The mapping from number back to resource type and ID is returned
 * alongside the text.
 *
 * <p>This class adds record timestamps as parenthetical citation labels
 * (e.g. {@code "(2024-01-15)"}) to the record text supplied by the caller
 * (querystore's serialized documents) — metadata for the LLM to reason about
 * chronology. The timestamp is not repeated on every line; see the compression below.
 * To save prompt tokens on charts that cluster many records per encounter date,
 * the date is <strong>run-length compressed</strong>: it is rendered on the first
 * record of each consecutive same-date run and dropped on the rest (and re-shown
 * after any undated record, which resets the run). The chart stays a flat numbered
 * list — a same-date follow-on line looks exactly like a legacy undated line — so
 * no information is lost and the model's per-record view is unchanged in shape. The
 * {@link RecordMapping} text, by contrast, always retains the inline date so the
 * grounding verifier can still resolve a cited date.
 *
 * <p>It also appends an obs-group label (e.g. {@code "(part of: Basic metabolic panel)"})
 * after the body of any record that carries obs-group metadata, so the LLM can cluster
 * the atomic members of a lab panel / vital-signs set — see {@link #groupMembershipLabel}.
 *
 * <p>Finally, the trailing {@code ".0"} OpenMRS adds to whole-number obs values is trimmed
 * (e.g. {@code "988.0"} → {@code "988"}) to save further prompt tokens — value-lossless and
 * scoped so a {@code ".0"} inside a code or version (e.g. ICD-10 {@code "E11.0"},
 * {@code "1.0.0"}) is preserved. See {@link #trimTrailingZeroDecimals}.
