	 * a chart of stopped prescriptions, and neither is one order it could not evaluate a stopped
	 * prescription.

	/**
	 * When the {@code Order} this record was serialized from stopped being in force, or {@code null}

	 *
	 * <p>It is core's own {@code Order.getEffectiveStopDate()} and nothing derived beyond it — the
	 * order's {@code dateStopped} where it has one, else its {@code autoExpireDate}. Never read off
	 * {@link #getText()}: that is {@link #orderActive}'s rule (issue #317) and it binds here for the
	 * same reason, sharpened by the fact that querystore renders no {@code auto_expire_date} into a
	 * record's TEXT — it carries it in the document's metadata — so a duration-lapsed prescription's
	 * end is in no rendered text to read.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>Non-null implies {@link #orderActive} is {@code FALSE}. {@code FALSE} does NOT
	 * imply non-null, and that asymmetry is the contract rather than a gap.</strong>
	 * {@code Order.isActive()} answers false for a voided order and for one whose action is
	 * {@code DISCONTINUE} before it consults any date, so a record can be marked not-in-force while
	 * this field states nothing. {@code null} here therefore never means "still in force" —
	 * {@link #orderActive} is the only thing that answers that question.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>Which real orders that reaches is a question two successive attempts to characterise
	 * got wrong, so what is recorded here is the measurement and not a rule about the population.</strong>
	 * Driving {@code OrderService.discontinueOrder} leaves BOTH records of the discontinuation
	 * carrying an effective stop date: the prescription through {@code dateStopped}, and the
	 * {@code DISCONTINUE} record core creates beside it through {@code autoExpireDate}. So an ordinary
	 * discontinuation is served rather than skipped — and that is asserted rather than remembered, by
	 * {@code DrugOrderCurrencyMarkTest.aRealDiscontinuationLeavesThePrescriptionCarryingItsStopDate},
	 * which drives the real service and checks both halves.
	 * {@code DrugOrder.cloneForDiscontinuing()} on its own sets neither date, and a row in that state
	 * states no date here — {@code DrugOrderCurrencyTestData.xml}'s order 9320 is one, written
	 * directly. Through {@code OrderService} it is not: {@code saveOrder} stamps
	 * {@code autoExpireDate = dateActivated} on every {@code DISCONTINUE} order it saves. The
	 * API-reachable instance of this cell is the VOIDED order named above.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>That paragraph is the third attempt at describing this population and the first two
	 * were measured false, so it is deliberately a measurement and a mechanism rather than a rule
	 * about which flows produce what.</strong> This is its ONE home: {@code docs/adr.md} Decision 98,
	 * {@code README.md} and the tests point here rather than restating it, because a claim that has
	 * needed correcting twice is the last one that should exist in five files.
	 *
	 * <p>Where an order does carry no date of its own, the module does not go looking for one on
	 * {@code getPreviousOrder()}: that would be a second implementation of core's discontinuation
	 * semantics, which is the re-derivation {@link #orderActive} exists to avoid.
	 *
	 * <p>Set only by {@code QueryStoreChartBuilder.toSerializedRecords}, beside
	 * {@link #orderActive} and off the same one authoritative order read.
