	 * note): it would be published as chart evidence about the patient, with no error anywhere —
	 * the provenance disclosure silently inverts.
	 *
	 * <p>The compiler cannot check this, so this test pins it: every declared
	 * {@code RESOURCE_TYPE_*} constant must have an explicitly recorded expected group. Adding a
	 * constant without deciding its group fails here.
	 *
	 * <p>If that is you, decide on PROVENANCE, not on whether the module injects it — "injected"
	 * is not the test, and using it as one is how this classification gets inverted. Ask whose
	 * record it is. {@code chart} when it is evidence about this patient, whether querystore
	 * retrieved it or the module read it from a patient-data service and injected it — that is why
	 * {@code RESOURCE_TYPE_ACTIVE_DRUG_ORDER} is {@code chart} below despite being injected.
	 * {@code reference} only when the content is module-supplied material rather than the
	 * patient's record, in which case {@code referenceGroup} needs updating too, since its fallback
	 * will not get you there.
	 *
	 * <p>Recording {@code reference} has a second consequence since issue #122, so decide knowing it:
	 * the type becomes demote-only for citation grounding, i.e. its citations can be flagged but never
	 * verified. That follows from the same provenance judgement — a cosine pass cannot check
	 * module-rendered prose against itself — and it is asserted by the guard below. Since issue #201
	 * that flag is module-internal: the wire serializes {@code grounded: null} for every
	 * {@code reference}-group citation, so recording a type here removes its citations from the
	 * grounding signal a client sees at all.

	 * <p>Why this exists. Grounding treats module-supplied material as demote-only: a cosine pass
	 * renders {@code null} (unverified), never {@code true}, because an answer sentence citing
	 * module-rendered reference prose is typically a recitation of it and embeds near-identically to
	 * its source whether or not it swaps subject roles (#106, measured). That carve-out named
	 * {@code drug_reference} alone, so when #110 added {@code safety_finding} — duly recorded above as
	 * reference material — the module's own deterministic findings were graded as if they were
	 * retrieved chart evidence, and published unstable {@code grounded} verdicts to clinicians for two
	 * releases. Nothing failed, because only the group registry was guarded.
	 *
	 * <p>So the rule is now derived from the group ({@link ChartSearchAiUtils#isGroundingDemoteOnly}),
	 * and this test asserts it against the group each constant is RECORDED as rather than against
	 * {@code referenceGroup}'s answer — otherwise a classifier bug would satisfy both registries at
	 * once and this guard would agree with it.
	 *
	 * <p>That the verifier actually honours the rule — no {@code true} verdict, no Tier-2 call, no
	 * entailment-cap slot — is asserted through the real verifier in
	 * {@code CitationGroundingVerifierTest.everyDeclaredResourceTypeConstant_isGradedAccordingToItsReferenceGroup};
