/**
 * What {@code backend-init.sh}'s {@code configure_retrieval_gps} leaves in the database when the
 * start it runs in has verified no embedder — the composition {@link ModelDownloadIntegrityTest}'s
 * ledger cases and {@link ModelDownloadPinningGuardTest}'s source checks each see only one half of.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a third channel exists.</b> The ledger answers what THIS shell verified and
 * {@code gp_set_if_blank} preserves a row an earlier start wrote; both are right on their own, and
 * the state they compose to was not. On the shipped entrypoint the embedder goes through
 * {@code fetch_or_degrade}, whose refusal now leaves the start RUNNING, so this wiring is reached
 * with an empty ledger by an ordinary refusal as well as by the subshell residue ADR Decision 106
 * names. The row the last good start wrote is still standing either way, and what it names depends
 * on WHICH refusal: the library's own code table gives codes 1, 2 and 6 a deletion and codes 3, 4
 * and 5 none — code 4, an artifact no manifest row resolves, never opens the target at all. So a
 * safety keyed on reading that property back finds it non-blank in both, and leaves
 * {@code querystore.bootstrap.autostart} on: the per-record exception flood that function's own
 * comment exists to prevent where the file is gone, and querystore embedding clinical questions
 * with bytes this start did not check where it is not. Neither existing channel can see either:
 * one drives the library without a database, the other reads source. Only running the wiring
 * against a store that REMEMBERS an earlier start does.
 *
 * <p><b>It runs the entrypoint's own functions, not a retelling of them.</b> Each function below is
 * taken verbatim out of {@code backend-init.sh} by name — a definition that moves or changes shape
 * fails this loudly rather than leaving it testing a stale copy — and sourced alongside the real
 * {@code scripts/model-manifest.sh}, so {@code require_verified} answers from a ledger real fetches
 * wrote. The test supplies two things and no logic: the variables the surrounding script assigns,
 * and a stand-in for the {@code mariadb} client, which is the database boundary the way
 * {@code ModelDownloadIntegrityTest}'s loopback server is the network one.
 *
 * <p><b>Most cases here drive the wiring function; some drive the whole file.</b>
 * {@link #theEntrypointsOwnStatementsLeaveTheStartRunningWhenTheEmbedderIsRefused} runs every
 * top-level statement of {@code backend-init.sh}, with the edges that reach outside a test
 * redirected, because what a refusal does to the START is not a property of the function the rest of
 * these cases call. The weights-status cases (#467) run the whole file for the same kind of reason:
 * what records the weights' outcome is split between the fetches, forked above the demo seed, and
 * the one writer started below it, and only the file composes the two. Where a fetch SITS relative to the wiring call is still
 * {@code ModelDownloadPinningGuardTest}'s question, and what the library itself returns is
 * {@code ModelDownloadIntegrityTest}'s.
 *
 * <p><b>The residue, named rather than claimed away.</b> The stand-in understands only the
 * statements these starts issue and REFUSES anything else, so a statement it cannot answer fails a
 * case instead of being silently accepted — but it is not MariaDB, and a defect that needs real
 * server semantics is outside it. Nothing here reaches the network: the manifest rows and the demo
 * dump url both name a file nothing serves.
