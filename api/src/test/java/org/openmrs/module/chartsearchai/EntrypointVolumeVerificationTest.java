/**
 * A weights file ALREADY on the volume still reaches the library's verification — the guarantee
 * #444 turns on, because {@code /openmrs/data} outlives the container and the deployments this fix
 * most needs to reach are the ones provisioned before it existed. ADR Decision 106 records that
 * removing {@code backend-init.sh}'s "the target exists, so return" early exit is the point of the
 * decision; this is what says it is still gone.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a behavioural channel, and not a source one.</b> Six rounds of source-position and
 * source-text guards on this change were each defeated by a plausible restructure, and this
 * property was defeated by the plainest of them: re-inserting {@code if [ -f "$target" ]; then
 * return; fi} at either fetch site left {@link ModelDownloadPinningGuardTest} — which asks whether a
 * fetch is NAMED and POSITIONED, never whether REACHING it is conditioned on the file's absence —
 * {@link ModelDownloadIntegrityTest}, {@code sh -n} and {@code shellcheck} all green. So this asks
 * what the entrypoint DOES: the library is the real one, the bytes on the volume are real bytes, and
 * the question is whether they get hashed.
 *
 * <p><b>It runs the entrypoint's own functions and its own call, not a retelling of them.</b> The
 * functions below are taken verbatim out of {@code backend-init.sh} by name through {@link
 * EntrypointSource}, the fetches are the entrypoint's own {@code fetch_llm_in_background} calls
 * pasted as written, and the library is {@code scripts/model-manifest.sh} itself. The test supplies
 * only {@code LLM_DIR}, the directory the fetches record their state in for the weights' status
 * (#467), a fixture manifest, and the bytes on the volume.
 *
 * <p><b>The residue, named rather than claimed away.</b> This reaches the LLM weights, whose fetch
 * the entrypoint wraps in a function it can paste. The embedder's two fetches are top-level
 * statements with no function to extract, so that half is
 * {@code ModelDownloadPinningGuardTest.everyArtifactTheEntrypointProvisionsIsFetchedUnconditionally}
 * — a source channel, and one that reads nesting rather than behaviour. Nor does this run the
 * entrypoint end to end: it cannot see a skip written anywhere but inside the functions it
 * pastes.
