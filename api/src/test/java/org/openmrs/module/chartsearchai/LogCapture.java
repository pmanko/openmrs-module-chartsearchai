/**
 * Captures what production code actually logs, so a test can assert the LEVEL an outcome is
 * reported at rather than only its return value.
 *
 * <p>Why this exists: a configured drug-reference source that resolves to zero entries used to be
 * reported exactly as a successful load — {@code log.info("Loaded {} ...", 0)} — which turned the
 * whole drug-safety feature off with nothing at default log levels to say so (issue #149). The
 * return value alone cannot pin that fix: an empty list is the correct fail-safe return in BOTH the
 * healthy-but-empty and the misconfigured case, so the only observable difference is the level. A
 * test that asserts on the WARN's message text instead would let a re-wording silently drop the
 * guard.
 *
 * <p>Attaches a collecting appender to the named logger and, because log4j2 appenders are inherited
 * by descendant loggers, sees everything logged under that name — pass a package name to capture a
 * whole package. The level is raised to {@code INFO} for the duration (via {@link Configurator}, so
 * the change lands on the shared logger CONFIG and therefore reaches descendant loggers —
 * {@code Logger.setLevel} would only affect the one instance) and is restored on {@link #close()}.
 * Capturing INFO as well as WARN matters for more than an INFO assertion: a capture that silently
 * received nothing at all would make "no WARN was logged" pass vacuously.
 *
 * <p>Use with try-with-resources; it is not thread-safe against a concurrent
 * {@link #close()} but the collected event list is.

	 * — reach over every OTHER logger in the package, given up only for the ones the caller says are
