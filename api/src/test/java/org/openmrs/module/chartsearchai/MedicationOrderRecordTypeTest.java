/**
 * The forcing function for {@link ChartSearchAiUtils#mayDescribeAMedicationOrder} (issue #377) — the
 * same one {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroupTest} provides for the reference-group predicates, and
 * for the same reason: a type-keyed classification with no sweep is one a later declared type falls
 * out of silently.
 *
 * <p>Here it falls out LOUDLY rather than silently — an unadmitted type is a type the check
 * REPORTS — which is the direction the ticket forced, since the two types its measurement caught
 * ({@code visit}, {@code encounter}) are querystore contract strings this module never declares and
 * a deny-list could not have named them. That is exactly why the sweep is worth having: adding a
 * declared type without deciding this question turns every active-order sentence citing one into a
 * WARN and a wire entry, and nothing else in the suite would say so.
