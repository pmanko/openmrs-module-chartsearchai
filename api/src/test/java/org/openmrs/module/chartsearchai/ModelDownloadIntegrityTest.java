/**
 * The behavioural half of issues #444 and #449: model files the module executes are fetched under a
 * digest committed in this repository, and bytes that do not match it never reach the filename the
 * module loads.
 *
 * <p><b>This drives the real shell.</b> {@code scripts/model-manifest.sh} is production code — it is
 * sourced by {@code backend-init.sh} (the published backend image's ENTRYPOINT) and by
 * {@code .github/workflows/build-standalone.yml} (the release pipeline for the README's download) —
 * and every case here executes it with {@link EntrypointSource#shell()}, dash where it is installed,
 * rather than restating what it ought to do.
 * The composed step {@code fetch_and_verify_url} is what both call sites reach, through the id and
 * override forms above it, so that is what is tested: calling a download helper and a digest helper in sequence from Java would test an assembly
 * no call site uses, which is the failure the project instructions' composed-method rule names.
 *
 * <p><b>The bad bytes are SERVED, not simulated.</b> Both findings state their acceptance the same
 * way — "verify by serving a file with a differing digest and observing the entrypoint reject it" —
 * so the cases here stand up a loopback {@link HttpServer} and let curl fetch from it over the
 * network stack the entrypoint really uses. A test that wrote a bad file into place and called only
 * the digest comparison would skip the fetch, the {@code .partial} and the rename, which is where
 * the defect lived.
 *
 * <p><b>Both controls are measured.</b> A verification test that only shows a rejection cannot tell
 * a working check from one that rejects everything, so each rejection case has a counterpart that
 * differs in the one thing being rejected — the same served bytes accepted under their own digest,
 * the same fetch accepted at the recorded size — and the counterpart asserts the file is placed.
 *
 * @see ModelDownloadPinningGuardTest for the structural half — that each call site still routes
 *      through this library and still pins its revision, which no behaviour of this library can show
 * @see EntrypointRetrievalWiringTest for what the entrypoint composes the ledger INTO: the global
 *      properties left behind by a start that reaches the wiring having verified no embedder, which
 *      needs a database that remembers an earlier start and so is neither this suite's question nor
 *      the guard's
