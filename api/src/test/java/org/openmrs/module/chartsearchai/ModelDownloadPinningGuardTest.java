/**
 * The structural half of issues #444 and #449: the two sites that fetch a MODEL — the container
 * entrypoint and the standalone release pipeline — name an immutable revision and an id in
 * {@code model-manifest.tsv}, and spell no Hugging Face URL of their own.
 *
 * <p>Those two sites are the scope both findings draw, and it is narrower than "everything this
 * project downloads" — ADR Decision 106 names what is left out and why.
 *
 * <p><b>This reads the SOURCE, and that is the point.</b> {@link ModelDownloadIntegrityTest} shows
 * that the shared library refuses substituted bytes; it cannot show that the two call sites still
 * ASK it to. A {@code curl} added beside a retained {@code fetch_and_verify} call, a revision
 * relaxed back to {@code resolve/main}, or a verification moved to after the rename all leave that
 * suite green and reopen the finding. This module pins that class of rule structurally — the same
 * argument {@code ActiveOrderInteractionPhraseTest} makes for reading source, and the same
 * two-channel split: one channel asks whether the right thing is named, the other whether it is
 * named in the right PLACE, because a site that named the library and then renamed the file anyway
 * would satisfy the first alone.
 *
 * <p><b>Naming and placing a fetch is not the same as REACHING it.</b> Every check here about the
 * entrypoint once answered only the first two, and a three-line test of the target's own presence in
 * front of a retained call satisfied both — the early return #444 removed, put back. {@link
 * #everyArtifactTheEntrypointProvisionsIsFetchedUnconditionally} is the third question, and it is
 * the entrypoint's LAYOUT half; the weights fetch's own behaviour is
 * {@link EntrypointVolumeVerificationTest}, which runs it against a target already on the volume.
 *
 * <p><b>Every scan asserts it found something.</b> A guard that walks looking for violations reports
 * none when it has scanned nothing at all, and passing for that reason is indistinguishable from
 * passing because the code is right. Each check here ends by asserting what it actually read.

	 * <b>The guarantee the check above is only a second channel for.</b> A model file's path reaches a

	 * what the running shell DID rather than where a fetch is written. Rearranging the entrypoint then
	 * leaves no path standing — the fail-closed direction — instead of pointing querystore at bytes
	 * this start never checked, and the same decline both WITHDRAWS a path an earlier good start
	 * wrote and turns the bootstrap sweep off. A refused fetch and one taken in a subshell both
	 * reach the wiring with an empty ledger, and the gate declines for either. What that composes to
	 * in a database that remembers an earlier start is {@link EntrypointRetrievalWiringTest}'s
	 * question, not this one's; source cannot answer it.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Two questions, and the second is asked the other way round.</b> The first ties a write to
	 * an ARTIFACT by the VARIABLE the fetch targets: {@code $ONNX_FILE} is what
	 * {@code fetch_or_degrade embedder-e5-base-v2-onnx} writes and what the property's value is built
	 * from. That reading alone is one intermediate assignment wide — copy {@code $ONNX_FILE} into a
	 * fresh name on one line and publish a third {@code querystore.embedding.*} property from that
	 * name on the next, and the write itself mentions no fetch target at all, which is the same
	 * alias that defeated the fetch deny-list {@link #DECLARED_NON_MODEL_FETCHES} replaced. So the
	 * second question inverts
	 * it: EVERY global-property write in the entrypoint must sit behind the ledger's gate unless the
	 * property is declared in {@link #DECLARED_NON_MODEL_PROPERTIES} as carrying no model path or
	 * the write {@link #withdrawsAPath}, and a write whose property name is not a literal this guard
	 * can read is itself a violation. A new path property then costs an entry there, which is the
	 * point at which someone asks whether it is a model's.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The residue, named rather than claimed away.</b> Both questions read THIS file, and only
	 * for the two write forms it uses: a statement assembled from fragments so that no line spells
	 * {@code INSERT INTO global_property}, or a property set from outside this file entirely, is
	 * outside both. And the artifact tie is asked only for
	 * {@link #CHART_SEARCH_NEEDS}, so a third must-have artifact's path sitting behind the ledger
	 * entry for a DIFFERENT one satisfies the inverted question. What {@code require_verified}
	 * answers at runtime is {@code ModelDownloadIntegrityTest}'s question, driven against the real
	 * library.

	 * <p><b>What this reads, and the residue.</b> It reads the logical command such an artifact is
	 * named on, and asks two things of it: that the command IS a {@code fetch_or_degrade} rather

	 * inside a multi-line {@code ( … ) &} group — and closing that would mean the library detecting
	 * its own subshell, which it has no portable way to do.
	 *
	 * <p>The second of those is not outside every channel any more. A multi-line {@code ( … ) &}
	 * around this entrypoint's own two fetches reddens
	 * {@link EntrypointRetrievalWiringTest#theEntrypointsOwnStatementsLeaveTheStartRunningWhenTheEmbedderIsRefused},

	 * <p>Measured 2026-09-22 in the image the demo was serving

	 * directory the base image ships — is {@code drwxr-xr-x}. {@code /usr/local/bin} is shipped too,
	 * which is why the library COPYed there was readable and only the manifest was not. The
	 * entrypoint's {@code exec runuser -u openmrs} runs before every fetch, so {@code _mm_field}'s
	 * {@code [ ! -f "$MODEL_MANIFEST_FILE" ]} answers "no manifest" and every fetch resolves nothing.
	 * The embedder's two codes are the part that is RECORDED — that start's
	 * {@code chartsearchai.models.embedderStatus} read
	 * {@code not verified in this start: embedder-e5-base-v2-onnx:4 embedder-e5-base-v2-vocab:4} —

	 * that record nothing. What was MEASURED of them is the absence: the demo's own
	 * {@code ModelFileResolver} reported {@code Model file not found} for both GGUF names, and for
	 * the three older names this project has used.
	 *
	 * <p>So the rule is that a mode-setting COPY may not be what CREATES the directory it lands in.
	 * It is deliberately unconditional rather than exempting the directories the base image ships:
	 * which those are is the fact that changed silently here, {@code /usr/local/bin} having covered
	 * for this line shape for as long as nothing was added beside it. {@code mkdir -p} over a
	 * directory that already exists leaves its mode alone, so obeying it costs nothing.
	 *
	 * <p>What this cannot see is a mode named on the {@code mkdir} itself ({@code mkdir -m 700}), and
	 * it says nothing about the FILE's mode, which is what {@code --chmod} is there to set.
	 * → #466; ADR Decision 106. The weights' half of that outage — the same failure, recorded
	 * nowhere a deployment can read — is #467.
