/**
 * Build-time guard on the project instructions — the root {@code CLAUDE.md} every session
 * reads, and every nested one named in {@link #SIZE_BUDGETS}.
 *
 * <p>It exists because that file rotted once, measurably. It grew from 5 KB to 159 KB in
 * twenty-six days by accreting rejected alternatives, measured ratios and review-round
 * narrative, until 94% of it was one subsystem and a single bullet ran to 39,603 characters
 * — while {@code docs/adr.md} and the javadoc already held the same reasoning. Nothing
 * noticed, because prose has no compiler. The 2026-08-31 trim cut it to 70 KB and added a
 * "Documenting a decision" section saying where a rule goes and where its evidence goes;
 * this test is what stops that section from being the only thing standing against a repeat.
 * It had regrown to its cap within six days of that trim, which is what prompted the
 * 2026-09-06 split: the drug-safety rules were 77% of it and now sit beside their own code.
 *
 * <p>Every check here corresponds to a defect actually found during that trim's review
 * rounds, and each one is a defect that no human reading catches reliably: a pointer that
 * no longer resolves, an identifier elided into ungreppable form, a suite total that went
 * stale the next time someone added a test. The checks are deliberately mechanical. What
 * they cannot see is whether the prose is TRUE — only that its pointers land and its
 * figures are not of the kind that rot.
 *
 * <p>None of these is a style preference. If one fires, the fix is to correct the file, not
 * to relax the rule — except the two that guard a quantity,
 * {@link #theProjectInstructionsStayWithinTheirSizeBudget} and
 * {@link #noBulletCarriesMoreProseThanItsBudget}, whose budgets are tripwires that may be
 * moved deliberately, in this file, with a reason.

	/**
	 * Every instruction file this guard binds, with its own size budget in bytes.
	 *
	 * <p>Trip points for unexplained growth, not targets. Before the 2026-09-06 split there was
	 * one file and one budget, and the budget had been raised twice to keep up with a file that
	 * had regrown to its cap within six days of a trim. Splitting it changed which number matters:
	 * the ROOT budget is the one paid by every session, and it is the one to defend. The reference
	 * budget is paid only by sessions that open that package.
	 *
	 * <p>So do not read the two together as a raise on the old 86,000. The per-session cost of the
	 * instructions fell by roughly three quarters at the split; what these two numbers do is keep
	 * each file from growing back independently.
	 *
	 * <p>Raising either is legitimate and expected eventually. Doing it in the same commit as the
	 * prose that overflowed it is not — that is the accretion, with the tripwire moved out of its
	 * way. Measure with {@code wc -c} on the file itself rather than differencing a figure quoted
	 * in a previous commit; every such figure written here has gone stale.
	 *
	 * <p>These are BYTES; the cost they stand in for is TOKENS, and the ratio here is not the
	 * usual one. Measured on the pre-split file through the harness's own context accounting,
	 * 85,984 bytes were 31.6k tokens — about 2.7 bytes per token, where ordinary prose runs
	 * nearer 4. Backticked identifiers, camelCase method names and em-dashes are why. So price a
	 * kilobyte here at roughly 370 tokens rather than 250 before deciding a budget is generous.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The reference budget was raised from 72,000 to 75,000 on 2026-09-07, and the raise is
	 * recorded rather than quietly taken.</b> The paragraph above calls a raise in the same commit as
	 * the prose that overflowed it illegitimate, and this is the state it did not cover: two branches
	 * each added one rule, and the first to merge (#379) left the file 19 bytes under the cap, so the
	 * second (#280) could not record a rule of any size. Trimming came first and is what makes the
	 * number honest — #280 folded its own new sub-bullet into the one above it, which framed the same
	 * decision twice, and cut its amendment to the chart-read bullet — and the residue that would not
	 * fit was a directive, not evidence. What 75,000 buys is the couple of ordinary rules the
	 * principle below asks for; it is a ratchet still, and the direction to move it is down.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Raised again, from 75,000 to 76,000, on 2026-09-09 — and it is the same state, which is
	 * the useful part.</b> #388's contraindication-lead sub-bullet and #395's finding-extent bullet
	 * were each written to fit, on branches that did not see each other; merging them left the file
	 * 300 bytes over, having added no prose in the merge at all. Trimming came first here too, and
	 * only on the newer of the two: #395's bullet gave up the gloss on what its two numbers assert
	 * (its own decision already names {@code ChartSearchService.FindingCitationExtent} as canonical
	 * for that) and the "three populations" reason for its never-derive rule, which ADR Decision 83
	 * carries. That recovered 155 bytes and left 145 of residue that is two directives, which is
	 * what the raise buys. It does not buy the couple of ordinary rules the principle below asks
	 * for — #397's own directive went in behind it and the file sits close to the cap again — and
	 * that is stated rather than left to be discovered by the next ticket to trip this.
	 * <b>Twice in three days is the signal, and it is not that the number is too small</b> — it is
	 * that two branches adding one rule each cannot both land, and the answer stays trimming rather
	 * than a bigger number, because the direction is still down.
	 *
	 * <p>One principle sets both: headroom of roughly a tenth — a couple of ordinary rules, not a
	 * section. Both were set at the split, a little under a tenth above what each file measured once
	 * {@link #noBulletCarriesMoreProseThanItsBudget} had been satisfied — room for a few rules, not
	 * for a section. Deliberately not tighter, and the first draft of this split got that wrong: the
	 * drug-safety file is where this module's active work adds rules, so a budget tripping on an
	 * ordinary ticket would be raised in the same commit as the prose that overflowed it, which is
	 * the one move the paragraph above calls illegitimate. A tripwire nobody respects catches
	 * nothing. They are ratchets even so: the direction to move them is down, and the root one —
	 * the only one every session pays for — is where that is worth the effort.
