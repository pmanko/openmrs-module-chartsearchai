/**
 * Eval suite for absent-data detection: asked about a topic the chart carries nothing on, the system
 * must produce a clear "no records" answer that names what was asked about, and must not answer about
 * some other topic instead.
 *
 * <p><b>What this file used to do (issue #203).</b> Its {@code @MethodSource} filtered on
 * {@code !isExpectedAbsent()}, so all 19 {@code expectedAbsent} cases of the 29-case dataset were
 * dropped — silently, since a filtered case is not a skipped case: the build reported <b>10 tests, 0
 * skipped</b> and nothing looked wrong. The 10 that ran asserted only that a stopword-stripped
 * question was non-empty, i.e. a property of {@link QueryPreprocessor#stripQueryStopwords} (which
 * {@code LlmInferenceServiceTest} owns, with six cases including the all-stopwords one), under a class
 * name and javadoc claiming to test absent-data behaviour. The dataset's
 * {@code expectedAnswerContains}/{@code expectedAnswerNotContains} held exactly the claimed
 * expectations, {@link EvalCase} exposed them, and nothing read them.
 *
 * <p><b>How it is split now, and why.</b> Naming an absent topic requires a real answer, and a real
 * answer requires the LLM — there is no deterministic path in this module that writes "no records of
 * cancer"; the module's part is to put the chart and the question in front of the model, and the model
 * writes the sentence. Retrieval's part — which records an absent-topic query retrieves — belongs to
 * openmrs-module-querystore (issue #51) and is not assertable here at all. So:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #absentTopicAnswerNamesWhatWasAskedAbout} runs all 19 absent cases against a real
 *       endpoint and asserts the dataset's expectations, joining the repo's opt-in convention
 *       ({@code PromptInjectionEvalTest}, {@code LlmAnswerQualityTest}) — <b>skipped, but visibly
 *       skipped</b>, which is the one thing the old filter was not.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #everyAbsentCaseIsRunAndEveryExpectationDiscriminates} runs unconditionally and is the
 *       guard against this defect recurring: it proves no absent case is filtered out of the run, and
 *       proves every single expectation of every case is one the assertion above would FAIL on. The
 *       same role the prompt-variation guard plays in {@code LlmAnswerQualityTest} — "the instrument
 *       has to assert it did something", and it has to do so in CI, where the LLM is not
 *       available.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #theEmptyChartPromptAsksTheModelToNameWhatIsMissing} runs unconditionally and asserts
 *       the deterministic half against real production code: the exact bytes
 *       {@link LlmProvider#buildUserMessage} sends when the chart yields no records.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #anAnswerNamingNoTopicFailsEveryCaseThatNamesOne} runs unconditionally and holds the
 *       oracle to the one thing it must never do: pass an answer that names nothing. It is what keeps
 *       {@code expectedAnswerContainsAny}'s OR lists (issue #216) from drifting into a grab-bag.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The 10 {@code expectedAbsent: false} cases are deliberately not run here — see
 * {@link #everyAbsentCaseIsRunAndEveryExpectationDiscriminates}, which asserts that they carry no
 * answer expectations, so their being unused is a checked property rather than a silent one.
 *
 * <p>Run the LLM-gated case with {@code -Dchartsearchai.absent.data.test=true} and optionally
 * {@code -Dchartsearchai.absent.data.endpoint=http://localhost:18085/v1/chat/completions}.
