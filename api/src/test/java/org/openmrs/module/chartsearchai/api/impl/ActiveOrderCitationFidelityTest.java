/**
 * Issue #377: an answer sentence reproducing this module's own finding — <em>"X interacts with
 * active order Y"</em> — attaches a CHART citation to it that points at a record which is not that
 * order. Measured on a real standalone, three of five such sentences in one answer cited a
 * condition, a visit and an encounter; a clinician following the citation behind <em>"interacts
 * with active order Methylprednisolone"</em> was shown <em>Benign neoplasm of thyroid gland</em>.
 *
 * <p>Nothing could see it. Every citation in that response serialized {@code grounded: null},
 * because a chart citation whose sentence also rests on a {@code safety_finding} has its entailment
 * negative withheld (issue #284) — a carve-out {@link CitationGroundingVerifier}'s own javadoc
 * names, along with the residue it accepts. The two exact comparisons that ran before this one
 * compare what the answer states about the REFERENCE records it cites, not which CHART record a
 * sentence was attached to.
 *
 * <p>What this file pins is the deterministic check that closes the reported class: where the
 * answer states the module's own active-order phrase, the chart citations offered for that claim
 * must point at records that can describe a medication order at all, and must not point at an order
 * the chart itself marks as no longer in force. It reports; it never rewrites; and its answer is
 * published so a client can tell a good citation from a bad one, which the wire could not before.
 *
 * <p>Everything here runs the real {@link LlmInferenceService#search}/{@code searchStreaming}
 * orchestration over a chart the real {@link PatientChartSerializer} rendered and the real
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator} → {@code injectRecords} → {@code renderFinding} chain injected
 * findings into, off the SHIPPED knowledge base — which carries the ticket's own pairs, so the
 * arrangement is the reported one rather than an imitation of it. Only the model is stubbed: answer
 * prose is not reproducible on a live engine, and the answer is the one variable this check is
 * about.
