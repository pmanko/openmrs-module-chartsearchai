/**
 * A question asking only for the patient's allergies states, in the answer, which of her active orders
 * conflict with them, rather than leaving that to a drug-safety chip beside a list the clinician asked
 * for.
 *
 * <p><b>The case.</b> <em>"any allergies?"</em>, asked of a patient prescribed two drugs she is recorded
 * as allergic to, came back with a complete allergy list and two red contraindication chips repeating it,
 * each tagged "About a current medication", and a note about what the safety checks covered. The one fact
 * the chips carried that the list did not — that two of the allergens are drugs she is prescribed — was
 * stated nowhere a clinician reading the answer would read it.
 *
 * <p><b>Everything but the model is real</b>: patient 7 of the standard dataset, her aspirin order 111
 * read through the real {@code OrderService}, a free-text aspirin allergy recorded on her; the real
 * injector and validator over a verbatim slice of the shipped knowledge base; and the real
 * {@link LlmInferenceService#search} and {@code searchStreaming}. The model is a recorder.
