	/**
	 * The constructor that can carry a provenance list is invoked from exactly one class in THIS
	 * module, which is all this walk can see (issue #305).
	 *
	 * <p><b>The api module is the scope, and it is not the whole of production.</b> The walk reads
	 * {@code api/target/classes}; {@code ModuleSourceRoot} exposes {@code apiRoot()} and no omod root,
	 * and api's test phase runs before omod is built in any case. So a construction in omod — where
	 * {@code RecordMapping}'s widest constructor is public and reachable — would leave {@code callers}
	 * equal to the expected singleton and this case green. The omod builds no mappings today.
	 *
	 * <p>Judgements elsewhere rest on this and none of them could see it — how many is not a count
	 * kept here, since each states its own dependence where it is written. The residue
	 * disclosure on {@code CitationGroundingVerifier.AnswerCitations.unanchored} and
	 * {@code ReferenceProseFidelityCheck}'s "needs no filter" note both argue from "an attached index
	 * is always chart-group", which holds only because the sole writer of {@code derivedFrom} is
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector}'s findings loop — allergy and condition uuids resolve to chart
	 * records, and the {@code safety_finding} mappings are appended after the uuid index is built, so
	 * a finding cannot attach a finding. Let another class construct a mapping with a derivation and
	 * both break silently and in opposite directions: the prose check would examine, and could
	 * publish an {@code unfaithfullyRenderedCitations} index for, a reference record the answer never
	 * cited, and {@code restsOnReferenceMaterial} would find a demote-only member in EVERY claim's
	 * rests-on set, withholding issue #284's negative for every chart citation in the answer.
	 * {@code SafetyFindingSeverityFidelityCheck}'s note of its own exemption argues from the last
	 * clause of that property rather than from the group — an attached index is never a
	 * {@code safety_finding} record, so it carries no rating for that check to require — and a rated
	 * mapping built with a derivation would have it publish an {@code unstatedFindingSeverities}
	 * entry against a citation the model never made.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Asked of the BYTECODE, and the earlier source-text form is gone rather than patched.</b>
	 * That form matched the literal {@code "new RecordMapping("} and counted commas, and review
	 * defeated it twice, measured: a fully-qualified {@code new
	 * …PatientChartSerializer.RecordMapping(} was invisible to the literal, and the
	 * comment-stripping added to fix an inline-comment miscount ate the tail of
	 * any line holding a {@code //} inside a STRING — an argument such as a URL — which dropped the
	 * counted arity and skipped the construction with no signal at all. That is the fail-open
	 * direction, and it was claimed to fail closed. What ends that sequence is a different KIND of
	 * question rather than another spelling on the list: the constant pool records the descriptor a
	 * call site actually invokes, so qualification, whitespace, comments and string literals are all
	 * out of the picture.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it cannot answer, and what does — both halves measured.</b> The pool says which
	 * CLASS invokes the wide constructor, not which of that class's four mapping constructions passes
	 * a non-empty list. A second caller reddens THIS case; giving the injector's own
	 * {@code drug_reference} construction a one-element derivation leaves it green and reddens
	 * {@code FindingChartRecordProvenanceContextTest.aChartRecordNamesNoProvenanceOfItsOwn} instead,
	 * over a real arrangement that injects such a record. The two halves are different kinds of
	 * question on purpose; neither alone is the property those three judgements need.
	 *
	 * <p>Every canary here fails on an empty discovery, because a guard that finds nothing forbids
	 * nothing: the classes directory, the mapping's own class file, more than one constructor arity,
	 * exactly one that takes a list, and at least one caller.

	 * two character-for-character copies of that selection into
	 * {@code ChartSearchAiUtils.safetyFindingMappings}, and until this rule existed the coupling was
	 * held by a javadoc sentence alone: a third site re-inlining the type test breaks nothing the
	 * day it is written — the spellings are equal — which is the hazard
	 * {@code ActiveOrderInteractionPhraseTest} records for
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.ACTIVE_ORDER_INTERACTION_PHRASE}. The divergence arrives later, as
	 * a prompt asking for an enumeration of one population while {@code findingCitations} counts
	 * another.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Two homes, not one, and the second is a different question.</b>
	 * {@code safetyFindingMappings} SELECTS the population; {@code referenceGroup} asks which
	 * of three types is reference material, off a bare type string with no mapping in sight, and
	 * {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroupTest} is what binds it. Naming both is what lets this rule
	 * be spelled as "nowhere else" rather than as a file exclusion.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it catches, measured by writing each shape into a third class in
	 * {@code api/src/main} and reading this case's own failures (2026-09-09, twelve shapes, all
	 * twelve reported):</b> the constant or its literal value {@code "safety_finding"} as the
	 * receiver of {@code equals} or {@code equalsIgnoreCase} — including the arrangement the
	 * production spellings themselves use, one of which wraps across a line — and the same token
	 * ANYWHERE in such a call's argument list. The rule keys on the METHOD NAME, so whatever
	 * qualifies it is out of the picture: the shapes measured were {@code java.util.Objects.equals}
	 * in BOTH argument orders, a {@code StringUtils.equals}-shaped two-argument helper, a fully
	 * qualified constant as the sole argument, and
	 * {@code Objects.equals(mapping.getResourceType(), CONST)} — an argument carrying parentheses of
	 * its own, which is what a positional pattern cannot read past. The
	 * null-safe respellings are the ones worth reaching, because a maintainer writing a third
	 * selection site reaches for them rather than for the constant-first receiver trick production
	 * uses, and this module already writes {@code Objects.equals} in {@code api/src/main}. It does
	 * not matter whether the comparison reads {@code getResourceType()} directly, so a re-inline
	 * through a local holding the type is caught too.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it does NOT catch. This list is not exhaustive and the shapes on it are UNCAUGHT
	 * rather than covered elsewhere</b> — measured in the same run: {@code contains},
	 * {@code startsWith}, a reference comparison ({@code type == CONST}) against the interned
	 * constant, a {@code switch} whose {@code case} label is the constant, and a comparison moved
	 * into a helper of another name ({@code sameType(type, CONST)}) all pass this rule silently. A
	 * re-collection through {@code referenceGroup} against {@code REFERENCE_GROUP_REFERENCE} passes
	 * too, and that one is out of reach by design — it selects THREE types and is a wider
	 * population, not this one respelled.
	 *
	 * <p><b>And the scope is {@code api/src/main/java}.</b> The omod is unreached (it builds no
	 * mappings today, the same disclosure
	 * {@link #theProvenanceCarryingMappingConstructorHasOneCaller} carries). The test tree is out of
	 * scope because a copy there cannot move the coupling this rule protects — a test file selects
	 * findings for its own assertion and reaches neither the prompt nor {@code findingCitations}.
	 * <b>That is not the same as saying the tree is funnelled through one matcher: it is not.</b>
	 * {@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.injectedFindings} is the matcher the tree is MEANT to use, and
	 * several test files besides it still spell the type test themselves; its own javadoc names that
	 * residue and the different hazard it carries, in the shape
	 * {@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.injectedActiveOrders} uses for its own.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It reads COMMENTS as well as code</b>, so a javadoc that quotes the predicate outside
	 * those two bodies reddens this case. That direction is a false positive rather than a silent
	 * pass, and it is the deliberate choice: comment-stripping is what defeated the earlier
	 * source-text form of {@link #theProvenanceCarryingMappingConstructorHasOneCaller}, eating the
	 * tail of any line holding {@code //} inside a string literal.
	 *
	 * <p>Both canaries fail on an empty discovery, because a rule that finds nothing forbids
	 * nothing: the walk must have read {@code ChartSearchAiUtils.java}, both named signatures must
	 * still be declared there, and <b>each of the two bodies must itself contain a match</b> — that
	 * last is what stops a rewrite of a production spelling from disarming the rule instead of
	 * reddening it. Measured: narrowing the receiver arm off the production spelling reddens on that
	 * precondition, and dropping either name from the allow-list reddens with the named method's own
	 * spelling reported as the violation.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What the two bodies keep honest is ONE alternative of ONE shape, and that is stated at
	 * the granularity it was measured at rather than as "the receiver shape".</b> Both spell
	 * {@code ChartSearchAiConstants.RESOURCE_TYPE_SAFETY_FINDING.equals(}, so the precondition above
	 * holds the reading to the QUALIFIED-CONSTANT receiver and to nothing else, and <b>any narrowing
	 * the two bodies still satisfy passes both preconditions</b>. Measured 2026-09-09, one mutation
	 * per run, each leaving this case GREEN: deleting the {@code "safety_finding"} literal arm from
	 * {@link #FINDING_TYPE_TOKEN}, the one home both readings are built from; replacing
	 * {@code equals(?:IgnoreCase)?} with {@code equals} in the receiver pattern and in
	 * {@link #EQUALS_CALL}, which are two copies of THAT fragment; and
	 * narrowing the receiver pattern to require the {@code ChartSearchAiConstants.} qualifier, after
	 * which the reading sees neither a static-imported
	 * {@code RESOURCE_TYPE_SAFETY_FINDING.equals(t)} nor {@code "safety_finding".equals(t)}. The
	 * literal arm is the live one of the three: the root {@code CLAUDE.md} carries a rule against
	 * testing a {@code resourceType} against a named type at all (issue #122), which exists because
	 * such tests do get written. Deleting the {@link #EQUALS_CALL} half of
	 * {@link #findingTypeTests} leaves this green too — neither production spelling puts the constant
	 * in an {@code equals} ARGUMENT list — and silently gives up every argument-side shape above, the

	/**
	 * Every answer this module builds carries the condition-rule coverage (issue
	 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/378">#378</a>) — asked
	 * of the CLASS FILES rather than of the source.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The source form of this guard kept being walked past, and what ended it was changing the
	 * question rather than widening the needle again.</b> Fresh reviewers got a coverage-less answer
	 * past successive versions of it with a qualified {@code new ChartSearchService.ChartAnswer(},
	 * with a COMMENT naming the construction (whose unbalanced bracket made a raw-text depth walk
	 * swallow every real construction after it), with a line wrap inside the qualifier, with a
	 * unicode escape ({@code new \u0043hartAnswer(}), and with a generic witness
	 * ({@code new <String> ChartAnswer(}). Do not read that as the list. Every one of them is a fact
	 * about TYPING, and none survives compilation: javac writes the same constructor descriptor into
	 * the calling class's constant pool for all of them, which is why the question moved here rather
	 * than the pattern getting another alternative.
	 *
	 * <p>So this reads {@code ChartAnswer}'s own constructor descriptors out of its class file, and
	 * then asserts that no other production class references any of them except the widest — the one
	 * ending in {@code DrugReferenceLoad$Coverage}. The descriptors come from the type's own METHOD
	 * TABLE, so every constructor it declares is in the forbidden set whatever its signature: a
	 * review agent added an arity opening on different parameter types and got a coverage-less answer
	 * past an earlier version of this that picked constructors out of the pool by a hardcoded
	 * descriptor PREFIX. It also closes what the source form conceded, that it could only see answers
	 * built in one FILE; this sees every class under {@code api/target/classes}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it actually proves is that every answer is built through the WIDEST constructor</b>,
	 * which is not the same as carrying a value: passing a literal {@code null} for that last argument
	 * satisfies this completely. A review round measured it — a fourth answer site calling the widest
	 * constructor with a {@code null} coverage leaves this green — and named it the likeliest escape
	 * of all, since {@code ChartAnswer}'s own telescoping constructors do exactly that. Closing it
	 * means reading the CALLER's bytecode for an {@code aconst_null} in that argument slot, which is a
	 * real instruction walk rather than a constant-pool read; this stops at the descriptor
	 * deliberately. So do not read a green run here as "every answer states a verdict" — it says no
	 * answer was built through a constructor that CANNOT state one.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The rest of the residue, named rather than claimed away.</b> It reads api's output only, because omod
	 * is not compiled when api's tests run — no {@code omod/src/main} class constructs an answer
	 * today, and one that did would be invisible here. It excludes {@code ChartAnswer} itself, whose
	 * telescoping constructors legitimately name every arity. And a class that builds an answer
	 * through a factory rather than a constructor is outside it, and so is one built REFLECTIVELY —
	 * {@code ChartAnswer.class.getConstructor(...).newInstance(...)} names no descriptor in the
	 * caller's pool, and a review agent confirmed it passes. No such factory or reflective
	 * construction exists.
	 *
	 * <p>And it reads BUILD OUTPUT, so it describes what was last compiled — which is why the module's
	 * own rule to measure with {@code mvn -o clean install} from the root binds this guard as much as
	 * any test. Reading compiled output is this repo's own idiom for a rule no behavioural case can
	 * see, rather than a departure from it: {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroundingWithholdingTest}
	 * reads every class file the controller compiles to and fails the build on a hardcoded
	 * resource-type name, and ADR Decision 40 cites it as the precedent for pinning a behaviour-neutral
	 * rule structurally. What that one needs from the pool is a NAME; what this one needs is a
	 * DESCRIPTOR. Neither needs a bytecode parser.
