	/**
	 * The constructor that can carry a provenance list is invoked from exactly one class in THIS
	 * module, which is all this walk can see (issue #305).
	 *
	 * <p><b>The api module is the scope, and it is not the whole of production</b> — said once, on
	 * {@link #assertSoleInjectorCallerOfMappingConstructor}, which is where the walk lives. The omod
	 * builds no mappings today.
	 *
	 * <p>Judgements elsewhere rest on this and none of them could see it — how many is not a count
	 * kept here, since each states its own dependence where it is written. The residue
	 * disclosure on {@code CitationGroundingVerifier.AnswerCitations.unanchored} and
	 * {@code ReferenceProseFidelityCheck}'s "needs no filter" note both argue from "an attached index
	 * is always chart-group", which holds only because the sole writer of {@code derivedFrom} is
	 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector}'s findings loop — allergy and condition uuids resolve to chart
	 * records, and the {@code safety_finding} mappings are appended after the uuid index is built, so
	 * a finding cannot attach a finding. Let another class construct a mapping with a derivation and
	 * both break silently and in opposite directions: the prose check would examine, and could
	 * publish an {@code unfaithfullyRenderedCitations} index for, a reference record the answer never
	 * cited, and {@code restsOnReferenceMaterial} would find a demote-only member in EVERY claim's
	 * rests-on set, withholding issue #284's negative for every chart citation in the answer.
	 * {@code SafetyFindingSeverityFidelityCheck} used to argue its own exemption from the last clause
	 * of that property — an attached index is never a {@code safety_finding} record, so it carries no
	 * rating for that check to require. Since issue #409 round two it takes the question from
	 * {@code SafetyFindingCitationExtentCheck.citedFindingIndexes} instead, which applies the #305
	 * filter itself, so a rated mapping built with a derivation no longer reaches that key's
	 * accusation walk. The hazard named here is the GROUP one above; that check is no longer a second
	 * one resting on this property.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Asked of the BYTECODE, and the earlier source-text form is gone rather than patched.</b>
	 * That form matched the literal {@code "new RecordMapping("} and counted commas, and review
	 * defeated it twice, measured: a fully-qualified {@code new
	 * …PatientChartSerializer.RecordMapping(} was invisible to the literal, and the
	 * comment-stripping added to fix an inline-comment miscount ate the tail of
	 * any line holding a {@code //} inside a STRING — an argument such as a URL — which dropped the
	 * counted arity and skipped the construction with no signal at all. That is the fail-open
	 * direction, and it was claimed to fail closed. What ends that sequence is a different KIND of
	 * question rather than another spelling on the list: the constant pool records the descriptor a
	 * call site actually invokes, so qualification, whitespace, comments and string literals are all
	 * out of the picture.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it cannot answer, and what does — both halves measured.</b> The pool says which
	 * CLASS invokes the wide constructor, not which of that class's five mapping constructions passes
	 * a non-empty list. A second caller reddens THIS case; giving the injector's own
	 * {@code drug_reference} construction a one-element derivation leaves it green and reddens
	 * {@code FindingChartRecordProvenanceContextTest.aChartRecordNamesNoProvenanceOfItsOwn} instead,
	 * over a real arrangement that injects such a record. The two halves are different kinds of
	 * question on purpose; neither alone is the property those three judgements need.
	 *
	 * <p>The canaries that stop this forbidding nothing are enumerated once, on
	 * {@link #assertSoleInjectorCallerOfMappingConstructor}, which holds them. A copy of that list
	 * stood here until the two cases were unified.

	 * because per line a wrapped {@code BodyHandlers\n.ofString(} was measured passing silently.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It also asks that each {@code response.body()} sit behind a named bounded reader, and
	 * that half is DEFENCE IN DEPTH rather than the answer.</b> As the answer it failed: a rule
	 * matching the reader's name in front of the call was defeated six ways. Reading the file
	 * dense and walking the whole tree closed two of them, measured — a wrapped read and a
	 * helper in another file both redden now. The other four do not close: a renamed reference,
	 * the exempt file hosting the read, a same-named production method
	 * ({@code LlmResponseParser.parseStreamingResponse} satisfies "preceded by
	 * {@code parseStreamingResponse(}" while removing the ceiling), and a ceiling left in place
	 * with its limit set to {@code Long.MAX_VALUE}, which no text match of any kind can see.
	 * {@link RemoteLlmEngineResponseSizeBoundTest} catches every one of those, by driving each
	 * entry point against a real hostile peer — measured, one at a time. What it cannot catch is
	 * a read on a path it does not drive, and that is the one thing this half adds: a NEW read
	 * site, spelled plainly, before any test exists for it. Read it as "a new read must sit
	 * behind a named reader", never as an answer to where the bytes actually go.</p>
	 *
	 * <p><b>Residue.</b> A buffering reader spelled in a way this list does not carry passes,
	 * and so does a new read reached through a reference named anything but {@code response};
	 * the behavioural suite is what catches those, on every path that suite drives. A new read
	 * that is BOTH differently named AND on a path nobody drives is covered by neither. The
	 * scan is keyed on the simple file name, so two production classes sharing one would leave
	 * a file unread — there are none today — and it

	 * two character-for-character copies of that selection into
	 * {@code ChartSearchAiUtils.safetyFindingMappings}, and until this rule existed the coupling was
	 * held by a javadoc sentence alone: a third site re-inlining the type test breaks nothing the
	 * day it is written — the spellings are equal — which is the hazard
	 * {@code ActiveOrderInteractionPhraseTest} records for
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.ACTIVE_ORDER_INTERACTION_PHRASE}. The divergence arrives later, as
	 * a prompt asking for an enumeration of one population while {@code findingCitations} counts
	 * another.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Two homes, not one, and the second is a different question.</b>
	 * {@code safetyFindingMappings} SELECTS the population; {@code referenceGroup} asks which
	 * of three types is reference material, off a bare type string with no mapping in sight, and
	 * {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroupTest} is what binds it. Naming both is what lets this rule
	 * be spelled as "nowhere else" rather than as a file exclusion.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it catches, measured by writing each shape into a third class in
	 * {@code api/src/main} and reading this case's own failures (2026-09-09, twelve shapes, all
	 * twelve reported):</b> the constant or its literal value {@code "safety_finding"} as the
	 * receiver of {@code equals} or {@code equalsIgnoreCase} — including the arrangement the
	 * production spellings themselves use, one of which wraps across a line — and the same token
	 * ANYWHERE in such a call's argument list. The rule keys on the METHOD NAME, so whatever
	 * qualifies it is out of the picture: the shapes measured were {@code java.util.Objects.equals}
	 * in BOTH argument orders, a {@code StringUtils.equals}-shaped two-argument helper, a fully
	 * qualified constant as the sole argument, and
	 * {@code Objects.equals(mapping.getResourceType(), CONST)} — an argument carrying parentheses of
	 * its own, which is what a positional pattern cannot read past. The
	 * null-safe respellings are the ones worth reaching, because a maintainer writing a third
	 * selection site reaches for them rather than for the constant-first receiver trick production
	 * uses, and this module already writes {@code Objects.equals} in {@code api/src/main}. It does
	 * not matter whether the comparison reads {@code getResourceType()} directly, so a re-inline
	 * through a local holding the type is caught too.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it does NOT catch. This list is not exhaustive and the shapes on it are UNCAUGHT
	 * rather than covered elsewhere</b> — measured in the same run: {@code contains},
	 * {@code startsWith}, a reference comparison ({@code type == CONST}) against the interned
	 * constant, a {@code switch} whose {@code case} label is the constant, and a comparison moved
	 * into a helper of another name ({@code sameType(type, CONST)}) all pass this rule silently. A
	 * re-collection through {@code referenceGroup} against {@code REFERENCE_GROUP_REFERENCE} passes
	 * too, and that one is out of reach by design — it selects THREE types and is a wider
	 * population, not this one respelled.
	 *
	 * <p><b>And the scope is {@code api/src/main/java}.</b> The omod is unreached (it builds no
	 * mappings today, the same disclosure
	 * {@link #theProvenanceCarryingMappingConstructorHasOneCaller} carries). The test tree is out of
	 * scope because a copy there cannot move the coupling this rule protects — a test file selects
	 * findings for its own assertion and reaches neither the prompt nor {@code findingCitations}.
	 * <b>That is not the same as saying the tree is funnelled through one matcher: it is not.</b>
	 * {@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.injectedFindings} is the matcher the tree is MEANT to use, and
	 * several test files besides it still spell the type test themselves; its own javadoc names that
	 * residue and the different hazard it carries, in the shape
	 * {@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.injectedActiveOrders} uses for its own.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It reads COMMENTS as well as code</b>, so a javadoc that quotes the predicate outside
	 * those two bodies reddens this case. That direction is a false positive rather than a silent
	 * pass, and it is the deliberate choice: comment-stripping is what defeated the earlier
	 * source-text form of {@link #theProvenanceCarryingMappingConstructorHasOneCaller}, eating the
	 * tail of any line holding {@code //} inside a string literal.
	 *
	 * <p>Both canaries fail on an empty discovery, because a rule that finds nothing forbids
	 * nothing: the walk must have read {@code ChartSearchAiUtils.java}, both named signatures must
	 * still be declared there, and <b>each of the two bodies must itself contain a match</b> — that
	 * last is what stops a rewrite of a production spelling from disarming the rule instead of
	 * reddening it. Measured: narrowing the receiver arm off the production spelling reddens on that
	 * precondition, and dropping either name from the allow-list reddens with the named method's own
	 * spelling reported as the violation.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What the two bodies keep honest is ONE alternative of ONE shape, and that is stated at
	 * the granularity it was measured at rather than as "the receiver shape".</b> Both spell
	 * {@code ChartSearchAiConstants.RESOURCE_TYPE_SAFETY_FINDING.equals(}, so the precondition above
	 * holds the reading to the QUALIFIED-CONSTANT receiver and to nothing else, and <b>any narrowing
	 * the two bodies still satisfy passes both preconditions</b>. Measured 2026-09-09, one mutation
	 * per run, each leaving this case GREEN: deleting the {@code "safety_finding"} literal arm from
	 * {@link #FINDING_TYPE_TOKEN}, the one home both readings are built from; replacing
	 * {@code equals(?:IgnoreCase)?} with {@code equals} in the receiver pattern and in
	 * {@link #EQUALS_CALL}, which are two copies of THAT fragment; and
	 * narrowing the receiver pattern to require the {@code ChartSearchAiConstants.} qualifier, after
	 * which the reading sees neither a static-imported
	 * {@code RESOURCE_TYPE_SAFETY_FINDING.equals(t)} nor {@code "safety_finding".equals(t)}. The
	 * literal arm is the live one of the three: the root {@code CLAUDE.md} carries a rule against
	 * testing a {@code resourceType} against a named type at all (issue #122), which exists because
	 * such tests do get written. Deleting the {@link #EQUALS_CALL} half of
	 * {@link #findingTypeTests} leaves this green too — neither production spelling puts the constant
	 * in an {@code equals} ARGUMENT list — and silently gives up every argument-side shape above, the
	 * {@code Objects.equals} ones included. <b>Trim nothing here on the strength of the build staying

	 *
	 * <p><b>The paren count is naive in the same way {@link #endOfBody}'s brace count is</b> — it

	 * silent. A {@code )} inside a literal ahead of the token ends the list early and truncates the

	 * real end, and in the ordinary case that means past the end of the FILE: {@link #endOfArguments}
	 * returns -1 and {@link #findingTypeTests} discards the call outright, which is the strongest
	 * fail-open path here — a real type test carrying one such literal leaves the rule altogether.
	 * It becomes loud only where a later net-extra {@code )} in the same file brings the depth back

	 *
	 * <p><b>Measured 2026-09-09 by putting each shape to this reading on its own: all four are

	 * silently restored a private marker dialect there, reddening
	 * {@link #safetyFindingCitationExtentCheckReachesMarkersOnlyThroughTheSharedDecodeStep} only
	 * after the fix;</li>
	 * <li>so did a THREE-LINE block comment whose middle line does not begin with {@code *}, which no
	 * per-line strip can see. That is why this walks the whole file and carries the block state
	 * across lines, and why the earlier heuristics on a line's first characters are gone: with the
	 * opener seen, a javadoc continuation line needs no heuristic to be recognised as comment.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * Each of those reddens its rule now, re-measured after the fix.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Attacked from the other side too, because a wrong strip reddens a COMPLIANT file and that
	 * is as bad.</b> Also measured: a string literal holding an unclosed {@code /*} ahead of a real
	 * {@code citedIndexes(} call on the same line leaves both rules green, so the literal tracking
	 * keeps a needle a naive strip would have eaten; a character literal holding a double quote, and
	 * a string literal holding an escaped one, do not swallow the {@code //} that follows them on the
	 * same line, each still reddening the finding-severity rule when the shared call is gone; and a
	 * trailing note merely MENTIONING {@code INLINE_CITATION} in an otherwise compliant
	 * {@code SafetyFindingCitationExtentCheck}, which reddened before any strip existed, is green.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The residue, named rather than claimed away: a needle inside a STRING LITERAL counts as
	 * code.</b> Measured the same day, on the fixed strip: a {@code log.debug} line naming
	 * {@code citedFindingIndexes(} beside the hand-rolled scan satisfies the required-call assertion
	 * and the build stays green. Symmetrically, a literal spelling {@code INLINE_CITATION} trips a
	 * dialect negative.
	 * Literals are kept deliberately — a bracketed-digit regex IS a string literal ({@code "\\["}),
	 * so blanking them would take the dialect negatives' own evidence away, and no per-needle policy
	 * is worth the parser.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Nothing here parses Java, and what that costs is measured rather than bounded.</b> The
	 * quote state is declared inside the per-line loop, so it resets at every newline and a
	 * multi-line TEXT BLOCK is not tracked: only the opening {@code """} delimiter line is
	 * quote-scanned, and every body line is read as ordinary CODE. Measured 2026-09-14 by driving
	 * this method from a throwaway same-package test — a {@code //} in a body line was stripped, and
	 * a {@code /*} in one opened block state that blanked the {@code """} terminator line and every
	 * line after it. This project sets {@code maven.compiler.source} to 11 and text blocks are Java
	 * 15+, so nothing under the scanned tree can hold one at this source level; a source-level bump
	 * is what makes it reachable, and everything after such a body line would then be blank to these
	 * rules — reddening a required-call assertion on compliant code and blinding a dialect negative
	 * over the same region, a wrong strip failing in both directions at once. Unicode escapes are
	 * not processed either, so a needle in a comment whose opening slashes are written as unicode
	 * escapes counts as code: measured the same way, such a line comes back byte-identical, while
	 * javac translates unicode escapes before it lexes and reads the line as a comment. Separately,
	 * an unclosed block comment blanks every line after the one it opens on.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It stays APART from {@code ChartSearchAiUncorroboratedChartMatchTest.liveCode}</b>, the
	 * omod-side stripper whose javadoc records the block form as the defect stripping {@code //}
	 * exists to close — read that one before touching this. Two reasons, either sufficient: they are
	 * in different Maven modules and this class is not on omod's test classpath, so sharing means
	 * publishing an api test-jar to hold a comment stripper; and they keep different things. That one
	 * strips one extracted method BODY and counts occurrences in it, and drops literals with the
	 * fail-open consequence its javadoc names; this one keeps literals, because a dialect negative's
	 * own evidence IS a string literal, and keeps one entry per line so a violation can name one.

	 * dropped its rating.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It does NOT reuse {@link #assertMarkersReachedOnlyThroughTheSharedDecodeStep}</b>, and
	 * the reason is that helper's own javadoc: it exists in one place so its two callers' needle set
	 * cannot drift apart, and a third caller requiring a DIFFERENT needle is that drift arriving by
	 * parameter. Its name would also be false here — this class reaches no markers at all, which is
	 * the point. What the two rules do share is the comment strip, and that one IS hoisted —
	 * {@link #codeLines}, so a comment form closed in one copy cannot be left open in the other. What
	 * stays duplicated is each rule's own loop and needles, because one signature over both
	 * polarities is what would put two needle sets behind it.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Stated POSITIVELY, for the reason its neighbours record:</b> forbidding spellings alone
	 * let three of four ordinary relocations through with the build green, and what closes them is
	 * that the entry point must be CALLED. The two dialect negatives are defence in depth — a
	 * maintainer who re-derives the reading here would most likely reach for markers to do it.
	 *
	 * <p>Nothing behavioural can pin the relocation itself: a local marker scan, or a
	 * {@code citedIndexes} call spelled here, answers identically on every case in
	 * {@code SafetyFindingSeverityFidelityTest}, so the suite stays green on exactly the regression
	 * this rule exists to prevent. What the behavioural cases DO pin is the answer — drop the skip
	 * and {@code aFindingOnlyTheStructuredArrayNamesIsNotAccusedOfDroppingItsRating} reddens; this
	 * rule is about where the answer comes from.
	 *
	 * <p>Same residue as its neighbours, named rather than papered over: it reads SOURCE TEXT, so it
	 * asks that the call be present and not that its result be used, and a second reading written
	 * BESIDE a retained call is out of its reach. Three comment shapes naming the removed call were
	 * each measured to satisfy it and each is now stripped — a trailing {@code //} note, a mid-line
	 * {@code /*} one closed on the same line, and a three-line block whose middle line does not
	 * begin with {@code *}; {@link #codeLines} carries those measurements, and the residues it does
	 * NOT strip, which include a comment opener written with unicode escapes. A needle inside a STRING
	 * LITERAL satisfies it too, a log line or an assertion message naming
	 * {@code citedFindingIndexes(} being indistinguishable here from a call to it. An earlier
	 * draft of this paragraph called that the CHEAPEST edit satisfying the rule while removing the
	 * reading, and it was not: a {@code was …} note on the replacing line was cheaper and closer to
	 * how the slip that motivated this rule was actually written, which is why that note is now

	/**
	 * Every answer this module builds carries the condition-rule coverage (issue
	 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/378">#378</a>) — asked
	 * of the CLASS FILES rather than of the source.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The source form of this guard kept being walked past, and what ended it was changing the
	 * question rather than widening the needle again.</b> Fresh reviewers got a coverage-less answer
	 * past successive versions of it with a qualified {@code new ChartSearchService.ChartAnswer(},
	 * with a COMMENT naming the construction (whose unbalanced bracket made a raw-text depth walk
	 * swallow every real construction after it), with a line wrap inside the qualifier, with a
	 * unicode escape ({@code new \u0043hartAnswer(}), and with a generic witness
	 * ({@code new <String> ChartAnswer(}). Do not read that as the list. Every one of them is a fact
	 * about TYPING, and none survives compilation: javac writes the same constructor descriptor into
	 * the calling class's constant pool for all of them, which is why the question moved here rather
	 * than the pattern getting another alternative.
	 *
	 * <p>So this reads {@code ChartAnswer}'s own constructor descriptors out of its class file, and
	 * then asserts that no other production class references any of them except the widest — the one
	 * ending in {@code DrugReferenceLoad$Coverage}. The descriptors come from the type's own METHOD
	 * TABLE, so every constructor it declares is in the forbidden set whatever its signature: a
	 * review agent added an arity opening on different parameter types and got a coverage-less answer
	 * past an earlier version of this that picked constructors out of the pool by a hardcoded
	 * descriptor PREFIX. It also closes what the source form conceded, that it could only see answers
	 * built in one FILE; this sees every class under {@code api/target/classes}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it actually proves is that every answer is built through the WIDEST constructor</b>,
	 * which is not the same as carrying a value: passing a literal {@code null} for that last argument
	 * satisfies this completely. A review round measured it — a fourth answer site calling the widest
	 * constructor with a {@code null} coverage leaves this green — and named it the likeliest escape
	 * of all, since {@code ChartAnswer}'s own telescoping constructors do exactly that. Closing it
	 * means reading the CALLER's bytecode for an {@code aconst_null} in that argument slot, which is a
	 * real instruction walk rather than a constant-pool read; this stops at the descriptor
	 * deliberately. So do not read a green run here as "every answer states a verdict" — it says no
	 * answer was built through a constructor that CANNOT state one.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The rest of the residue, named rather than claimed away.</b> It reads api's output only, because omod
	 * is not compiled when api's tests run — no {@code omod/src/main} class constructs an answer
	 * today, and one that did would be invisible here. It excludes {@code ChartAnswer} itself, whose
	 * telescoping constructors legitimately name every arity. And a class that builds an answer
	 * through a factory rather than a constructor is outside it, and so is one built REFLECTIVELY —
	 * {@code ChartAnswer.class.getConstructor(...).newInstance(...)} names no descriptor in the
	 * caller's pool, and a review agent confirmed it passes. No such factory or reflective
	 * construction exists.
	 *
	 * <p>And it reads BUILD OUTPUT, so it describes what was last compiled — which is why the module's
	 * own rule to measure with {@code mvn -o clean install} from the root binds this guard as much as
	 * any test. Reading compiled output is this repo's own idiom for a rule no behavioural case can
	 * see, rather than a departure from it: {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroundingWithholdingTest}
	 * reads every class file the controller compiles to and fails the build on a hardcoded
	 * resource-type name, and ADR Decision 40 cites it as the precedent for pinning a behaviour-neutral
	 * rule structurally. What that one needs from the pool is a NAME; what this one needs is a
	 * DESCRIPTOR. Neither needs a bytecode parser.

	 *
	 * <p><b>Nothing behavioural can pin the ONE-PLACE half</b>, for the plain reason that a third
	 * splitter is a code path no existing case invokes: every case in
	 * {@code CitationGroundingVerifierTest} drives the two splitters that exist, so one added
	 * beside them answers identically on all of them while restoring the quadratic copy for the
	 * input shape the rule exists for — a marker-dense answer from a remote endpoint. The CHARGE
	 * half is a different matter and is well covered there: delete the charge from
	 * {@code newFragment} and the behavioural cases redden. This rule asserts it anyway, so that
	 * the two halves of one sentence are read in one place.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The allow-list is the two FACTORIES and not the methods that call them</b>, which is
	 * what makes the needle the construction rather than its neighbourhood. The two constructions
	 * are not interchangeable — the WHOLE-sentence one copies text the answer already holds, once
	 * per sentence, so it is linear and needs no allowance, while a FRAGMENT is one per MARKER and
	 * is the copy that multiplies — and each has a factory of its own,
	 * {@code newSentence} and {@code newFragment}, so no SPLITTER is allow-listed at all.
	 * An earlier form of this rule allow-listed
	 * {@code splitIntoCitedSentences(String, FragmentBudget)} instead, because the whole-sentence
	 * construction sat there; a reviewer then wrote an uncharged per-marker splitter into that same
	 * method — its natural home, since it already holds the budget and already constructed
	 * Sentences — and this rule stayed green.
	 *
	 * <p>It reads SOURCE TEXT, and the constant-pool idiom
	 * {@link #theOrderStopDateStampIsWrittenInOnePlace} uses cannot express this one: that helper
	 * records which CLASS FILE invokes a constructor, and {@code newFragment} and both splitters
	 * compile into the one outer class file, so it would report a single caller either way —
	 * whichever of them held the construction. The residue of reading source instead: a construction spelled
	 * some other way — a factory of its own that this needle does not name — is out of reach, the
	 * same residue {@link #classCodeFidelityCheckReachesMarkersOnlyThroughTheSharedDecodeStep}
	 * records for its own scan. And the allow-list is matched against the enclosing DECLARATION
	 * LINE, so a method whose own signature happens to spell one of the two factory names is
	 * admitted with them.
	 *
	 * <p><b>This rule bounds CONSTRUCTION and nothing else, which leaves two per-marker splitters
	 * it cannot see.</b> A reviewer wrote both and the suite stayed green on each. One calls the
	 * allow-listed whole-sentence factory once per marker — the construction is then legitimate,
	 * because it is that factory's own — and
	 * {@link #theWholeSentenceFactoryHasOneCallSiteAndItIsTheSentenceSplitter} is the rule that
	 * reaches it. The other goes through {@code newFragment} as it should but charges a
	 * {@code FragmentBudget} it made itself, which is bounded per sentence rather than per answer;
	 * {@link #aSplitAllowanceIsCreatedOnlyAtTheTwoAnswerEntryPoints} is the rule that reaches that
	 * one. Neither is a widening of this one, because neither is a question about where a

	 *
	 * <p>Reads TWO BODIES by brace matching rather than the file: {@code restsOn}'s own, and the

	 * fields, construct a {@code ClaimSupport} and test membership, and nothing else. Every

	 * either body reddens this and has to be allow-listed, which is the cost of asking the question
	 * this way round and is paid deliberately. {@link #endOfBody} counts braces blind to
	 * strings, so an unbalanced one inside either body moves the region's end; comments cannot,
	 * because the region is cut from {@link #codeLines} output rather than the raw file.
