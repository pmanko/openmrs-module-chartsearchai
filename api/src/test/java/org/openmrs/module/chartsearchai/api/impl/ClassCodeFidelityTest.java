/**
 * Issue #142: the model can transcribe an ATC class code wrongly while citing the deterministic
 * record that carries the right one. Observed live, twice on one probe: the chip said
 * {@code J01MA} (fluoroquinolones) and the answer, citing that finding's record number, said
 * {@code J01CA} (penicillins) — two drug families, one character apart, in a sentence a clinician
 * reads as a classification claim.
 *
 * <p>Nothing in the pipeline could see it. A citation of an injected finding never enters Tier-2
 * entailment at all (reference-group citations are demote-only), so the only pass that sees it is
 * Tier-1 cosine, which a two-character edit inside an alphanumeric token barely moves; where Tier-2
 * does run, on a chart record, it is paraphrase-tolerant, which is the wrong tolerance for a code
 * substitution. The citation itself is valid, so index validation passes. The chip is right, the
 * record is right, the citation is right, and the sentence is wrong.
 *
 * <p>What this file pins is the deterministic check that closes it: when the records an answer
 * cites state class codes, every ATC-shaped token in the answer must be one of them — or one the
 * QUESTION states, which is the reader's own word and not a fabrication — and one that is not is
 * reported at WARN carrying both the code the answer states and the codes its cited records state.
 * When they state none, there was nothing to copy and the check says nothing. Since issue #338 it
 * also pins what the answer does with a code it copied FAITHFULLY: a code stated more than once
 * inside one parenthetical, and a citation marker placed inside one, are reported from the shape of
 * the prose alone, each parenthetical read at its own level — see the block above
 * {@link #aClassCodeRepeatedInsideOneParentheticalIsReported()} for what that level buys and
 * what it gives up. There is deliberately
 * no roll-up from a cited substance code to its class: correct as such an answer usually is,
 * accepting it silences this issue's own headline capture, and
 * {@link #generalisingACitedSubstanceCodeToItsClassIsReported()} pins that with the reason. The answer prose
 * is never rewritten — a silent edit of a clinician-facing sentence is a larger decision than this
 * check, and a visible flag is worth more than a quiet repair.
 *
 * <p>Everything here runs through the real {@link LlmInferenceService#search}/
 * {@code searchStreaming} orchestration over REAL production-rendered records: the cited finding is
 * the one the real validate → injectRecords → renderFinding chain produces off the bundled DDInter
 * sample for a patient on a fluoroquinolone asked about ciprofloxacin, so the code the check
 * compares against is the code production actually writes. Only the model is stubbed — answer prose
 * is not reproducible on a live engine, so a canned answer is the only way to fix the one variable
 * this check is about.

	 *  its constant's javadoc names this file as what pins it from below — and it is recorded here so
	 *  a maintainer who reddens them is not left reading the wrong file.
	 *

	 *  #338's cases into this file falsified all three in one commit, and a count that replaces a
