/**
 * Issue <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/294">#294</a>: what
 * the module does with a grounding verdict for an injected {@code active_drug_order} record whose
 * display names no drug.
 *
 * <p><b>This recorded a measurement until the remedy landed, and now records the remedy.</b> The
 * exposure was that {@code RESOURCE_TYPE_ACTIVE_DRUG_ORDER} groups as {@code REFERENCE_GROUP_CHART},
 * so unlike {@code drug_reference} and {@code safety_finding} its verdict is NOT withheld at the wire
 * by {@code ChartSearchAiRestController.groundedForWire} (#201) — a {@code false} reached a client as
 * <em>Unsupported</em>, in red, on the module's own reconciliation record. The measurement #294 asked
 * for first was run and answered yes (ADR Decision 38's owed-measurement section), and the remedy is
 * that such a citation is now {@code Disposition.UNVERIFIABLE}: no verdict in either direction, in
 * either mode. <b>The cases below therefore assert the opposite of what they asserted when this class
 * was written</b>, which is the behaviour change the issue asks for and not a loosened assertion —
 * the preconditions and the judge-recording are unchanged and what moved is the published value. The
 * arrangement each case RUNS is unchanged too, though it is now built per case rather than in
 * {@code setUp}, so that the named non-regression added beside them differs from them in one call.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing is withheld at the WIRE, and that is the point of siting it here.</b> The remedy
 * leaves {@code RecordReference.getGrounded()} null, so {@code groundedForWire} publishes null with
 * no second carve-out of its own and the guard #294's text worried about is untouched. Which is why
 * these cases read the verdict off the answer's reference and assert nothing about serialization.
 *
 * <p><b>What this class adds, and what it deliberately does not.</b> Two things about this record
 * were already pinned and are NOT repeated here:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the wire half, by {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroundingWithholdingTest}, which cites every
 * declared {@code RESOURCE_TYPE_*} at {@code TRUE} and at {@code FALSE} and derives its expectation
 * from {@link ChartSearchAiUtils#isGroundingDemoteOnly} — so a chart-group type's attached verdict
 * is asserted to survive serialization at all four emission sites;</li>
 * <li>the co-cited arrangement, by
 * {@code CitationGroundingVerifierTest.compositeClaim_chartCitationCoCitedWithAFindingRendersUnverifiedNotUnsupported},
 * over an {@code active_drug_order} record built by the real render chain. A codes-only display
 * cannot change that outcome: the #284 withholding branch reads no record TEXT, only
 * {@code llmVerdict}, the disposition and index-set membership.</li>
 * </ul>
 * What was unpinned is the COMPOSED path. The only other test that installs a verifier into
 * {@link LlmInferenceService} overrides {@code verify} wholesale over a pass-through injector, so
 * nothing joined the real {@code DrugReferenceInjector} to the real
 * {@link CitationGroundingVerifier} through {@code search}. That is what this drives.
 *
 * <p><b>It does not measure a cosine, and cannot.</b> Tier-1 compares embeddings, and no embedding
 * model runs here — {@code resolveEmbedder()} returns {@code null}, which models a deployment with
 * none. That means the {@code null} these cases read is OVER-DETERMINED for Tier-1: a change that
 * merely dropped this record from Tier-2 candidacy would leave them green. <b>So the discriminating
 * half of each case below is that the judge was never ASKED</b>, and the tier the null must survive a
 * real cosine in is pinned where a cosine can be arranged —
 * {@code CitationGroundingVerifierTest.codesOnlyActiveOrder_aCosineFailIsWithheldRatherThanPublished}
 * is the case that separates this remedy from demote-only, because demote-only keeps a fail. What
 * this class adds over those is the COMPOSED path: the real injector minting the record and stamping
 * it, the real verifier reading the stamp, joined through {@code search}.
