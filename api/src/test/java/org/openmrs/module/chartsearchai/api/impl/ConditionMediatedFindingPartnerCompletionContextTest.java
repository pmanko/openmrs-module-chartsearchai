/**
 * Issue <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/555">#555</a> through the
 * CONDITION-MEDIATED finding (ADR Decision 111): it names an order by the knowledge base's label for the
 * row that order resolved to — her <em>Lactic acid</em> as <em>Lactic acid (lactate)</em> — so an answer
 * naming the drug read as leaving the order out, and the module appended it under "not named above".
 *
 * <p>Context-sensitive because that finding is gated on {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.derivedFindings},
 * which ships off and which only a context can turn on; {@link #setUp} does. Everything else is
 * {@link CitedFindingPartnerCompletionTest}'s arrangement: the real {@link LlmInferenceService#search}
 * over findings the real injector wrote from the shipped knowledge base, only the model stubbed.
