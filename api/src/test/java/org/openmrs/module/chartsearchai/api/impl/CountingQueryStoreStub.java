/**
 * Shared counting {@link QueryStoreService} double for the chart-builder tests
 * ({@code QueryStoreChartBuilderTest}, {@code QueryStoreChartBuilderScopedTest}) — one
 * implementation of the interface's read surface, so an interface change is absorbed once and
 * the two files cannot quietly pin different builder contracts. Same consolidation rationale as
 * {@code TestDatasetHelper}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why a dynamic proxy and not {@code implements QueryStoreService}</strong> (#165):
 * retrieval belongs to openmrs-module-querystore (#51) and its API is expected to keep moving.
 * A class that implements the interface must override every abstract method it declares, so each
 * method querystore gained stopped chartsearchai's tests <em>compiling</em> — and only for whoever
 * had built querystore locally, since CI resolves an older remote snapshot. The error named this
 * test class rather than the dependency that changed. A proxy is bound to the interface at
 * runtime, so it names no method set at compile time and interface growth cannot break the build.
 *
 * <p>An abstract adapter with no-op defaults — the other obvious shape — does not fix this:
 * a concrete subclass must still override every abstract method inherited from anywhere, so the
 * identical "is not abstract and does not override abstract method" error just moves to the
 * subclass. That shape only helps when upstream adds methods as {@code default}, which is not
 * what happened.
 *
 * <p><strong>Tolerating growth must not mean answering silently.</strong> Every method this
 * double does not deliberately serve is refused with an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}
 * naming it. A default-returning double is a worse failure than a compile break: a test would
 * pass while exercising nothing, and nobody would be told. Note the direction of the safety —
 * refusing loudly can only fail a test that has started depending on a new querystore call,
 * which is a decision a human should make; returning an empty list where the real service
 * returns data would silently weaken every downstream assertion.
 *
 * <p>Growth is absorbed; a counted method being <em>removed or resignatured</em> is not, and
 * deliberately so — the counts those tests assert would no longer mean anything. That case fails
 * when the double is constructed, with a message naming querystore, which is where the cause is.
