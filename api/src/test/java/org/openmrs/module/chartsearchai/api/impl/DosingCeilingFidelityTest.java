/**
 * Issue <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/276">#276</a>: the
 * injected record carries the stricter presentation-specific ceiling since issue #274, and the
 * answer still leads with the canonical row's laxer one. Measured live on a RefApp 3.7.1
 * standalone, deterministic across reruns — a patient charted on a low-dose aspirin presentation,
 * answered with the canonical row's 4000 mg/day, citing the record that stated both numbers.
 *
 * <p><b>The arrangement is the ticket's own.</b> {@code Acetylsalicylic acid} at 4000 mg/day and
 * {@code Acetylsalicylic acid (enteric-coated)} at 300 mg/day, one substance by
 * {@code substanceName}, both publishing the alias {@code aspirin} so that neither out-claims the
 * other — which is what made {@code DrugReferenceInjector.rowAttribution} correctly silent on the
 * reported answer, and is why this check asks which ceiling was quoted rather than which row is the
 * subject. The two ceilings are read off what the real injector wrote in {@link #setUp()} and never
 * from the fixture's description.
 *
 * <p>Everything here runs the real {@link LlmInferenceService#search}/{@code searchStreaming}
 * orchestration over a chart the REAL {@code DrugReferenceInjector} produced from the REAL
 * {@code DrugReferenceService} over a JSON fixture. Only the model is stubbed: answer prose is not
 * reproducible on a live engine, and the answer is the one variable this check is about.
 *
 * <p><b>What is NOT here.</b> What the injector writes onto the record — which rows contribute a
 * ceiling and which skips drop one — is
 * {@code ReferenceRecordSubstanceCeilingsTest}'s, which owns that section. This file asks only what
 * the answer did with it.
