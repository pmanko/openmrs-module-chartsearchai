/**
 * Issue #315: an answer that NAMES a drug from a drug-order record the module has marked
 * {@code ". Order status: not in force"} must tell the clinician the prescription has ended.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why this is a prompt rule and not another structural change.</strong> Issue #317
 * (Decision 46) already put the discriminator in the record: {@link PatientChartSerializer} appends
 * {@link PatientChartSerializer#ACTIVE_ORDER_LABEL} / {@link PatientChartSerializer#INACTIVE_ORDER_LABEL}
 * to a {@code drug_order} record body wherever the module could establish the answer — and nothing
 * where it could not, which {@code SerializedRecord.getOrderActive()} enumerates. The model
 * demonstrably READS it — issue
 * #315's own re-measurement records an answer quoting <em>"the order status is not in force"</em>
 * back unprompted. What was missing is any instruction that the field MATTERS, which is ADR Decision
 * 45's own diagnosis in as many words: <em>"The reported defect is not that the model cannot read the
 * marker; it is that nothing tells it the marker MATTERS."</em>
 *
 * <p><strong>Decision 45 REJECTED a prompt clause for this ticket, and this is not a re-proposal of
 * it.</strong> That entry's impossibility argument is explicitly scoped to a BINARY framing over TEXT
 * markers, and both of its load-bearing premises are void since #317. Its item 3 — <em>"a
 * classification is only as good as the discriminator available to the classifier, and here there is
 * none"</em> — described a chart in which an order lapsed by {@code auto_expire_date} rendered no end
 * marker at all; that order now renders {@code ". Order status: not in force"}, pinned by
 * {@code DrugOrderCurrencyMarkTest.anOrderThatLapsedByItsDurationIsMarkedNotActive}. Its item 1 — the
 * ENDED branch needs a CURRENT contrast to fire — described a prompt that had to CONSTRUCT the
 * contrast from markers; the contrast is now published in the record as the field's positive value.
 * So the clause is not a classification instruction at all: it is a REPORTING instruction conditioned
 * on a token the record states, and a record carrying no mark simply fails its antecedent.
 *
 * <p>That is an argument rather than a measurement, which is why the clause was gated on an
 * interleaved A/B over ADR Decision 45's own two decisive cells plus the two residue shapes it
 * records — see the PR for #315 and Decision 47.
 *
 * <p><strong>What is real here, and what is not.</strong> Real: {@code OrderService}, the orders
 * themselves, querystore's own {@link DrugOrderRecordSerializer}, {@link QueryStoreChartBuilder}'s
 * build path through {@code toSerializedRecords} and {@code readOrderCurrency},
 * {@link PatientChartSerializer#serialize}, {@link LlmProvider#DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT},
 * {@link LlmProvider#buildUserMessage}, {@link LlmProvider#extractResponse}, and the model. Stubbed:
 * querystore's INDEX, because it does not run under {@link BaseModuleContextSensitiveTest} — the same
 * seam {@code DrugOrderCurrencyMarkTest} and {@code QueryStoreChartBuilderTest} use — and the
 * builder's global-property seams, so the mode under test is chosen rather than read.
 *
 * <p>The four answer cases — two in the direction the clause fires, two in the CONVERSE direction
 * ({@link #anAnswerOverAChartOfOneLiveOrderReportsItAsCurrent},
 * {@link #anAnswerOverAMixedChartStillNamesTheLiveDrug}) — are <b>opt-in</b> and skipped
 * without an endpoint, the convention
 * {@link LlmEndpointTestSupport} exists for. They repeat with a DECOY completion between samples
 * rather than consecutively: Decision 45's methodology finding is that consecutive repeats re-use
 * llama's KV prefix and so reproduce the previous decode rather than re-testing it, and issue #315's
 * own re-measurement caught this exact question class at 1 of 3 on one build.

	 * The rule is in the prompt at all.

	 * <p><strong>What the ONE-BRANCH assertions really catch, measured by mutation on this head and
	 * not reasoned about.</strong> Three assertions, and they are unequal — say which does the work
	 * rather than letting the trio look uniform.
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><b>The region equality</b> is the one that pins the property. The order-status rule must be
	 * exactly the two measured sentences over the WHOLE span between the {@code "Drug reference"}
	 * sentence and the {@code "Safety finding"} one, so a second half added on either side of it
	 * reddens. Demonstrated with a review round's own mutation — appending <em>"A drug-order record
	 * that does not carry it is a record of a prescription the patient is still on; report such a
	 * drug as current."</em> to the clause: RED here, where before this assertion existed the whole
	 * of {@code EndedOrderAnswerRuleTest} and {@code LlmProviderTest} stayed green on it.</li>
	 * <li><b>The occurrence count</b> reaches outside that region, which is the only reason it is a
	 * separate assertion. The same sentence moved down into the answering-rules paragraphs leaves the
	 * region intact and reddens the count: RED, measured.</li>
	 * <li><b>{@code assertFalse(contains(ACTIVE_ORDER_LABEL))}</b> pins almost nothing on its own — a
	 * positive half written without quoting that constant passes it. It is kept because it catches a
	 * half built the way the negative one is, from the sibling constant, which is the shape a
	 * symmetry-minded change reaches for first.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p><strong>The residue, stated rather than papered over.</strong> A positive currency
	 * instruction placed OUTSIDE the region and worded with neither the phrase {@code "drug-order
	 * record"} nor the mark's constant gets past all three — measured GREEN with <em>"A prescription
	 * whose record states no such status is one the patient is still on; report it as current."</em>
	 * appended after the citation rule. Closing that would need a blocklist of positive-half
	 * phrasings, which {@code CLAUDE.md}'s own {@code score_probe_safety} lesson says not to build:
	 * three successive marker lists there were each refuted by a wording nobody had thought of. So
	 * the guard is stated positively — this REGION is exactly this TEXT, and the record class is
	 * named ONCE — and a shape that evades it is a new assertion here, not a looser one.

	 * shape), so an answer correctly reporting the lapsed one as ended is textually indistinguishable
	 * from one wrongly reporting the live one. A review round measured the mixed direction by hand
	 * instead — 12 candidate-arm samples over three mixed charts, no live drug reported as not in
	 * force — and {@link #anAnswerOverAMixedChartStillNamesTheLiveDrug} carries the half of it an
	 * oracle can express.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>NO MUTATION TRIED MOVES THIS CASE, and that is stated here rather than left for the
	 * next reader to discover.</strong> Four were run against the live endpoint on this head, every
	 * one 3/3 GREEN: composing the clause's antecedent from {@code ACTIVE_ORDER_LABEL} instead (so
	 * the LIVE record satisfies it and the clause asks for an ending on it); dropping the antecedent
	 * altogether (<em>"A drug-order record is a record of an order that has ended. Whenever your
	 * answer names a drug from such a record, say ... no longer in force."</em>); the same two
	 * against {@link #anAnswerOverAMixedChartStillNamesTheLiveDrug}; and renaming BOTH marks to issue
	 * #317's rejected {@code ". Order status: active"} / {@code ". Order status: not active"} pair,
	 * the wording that produced the fold on the standalone. On these fixture charts the model reads
	 * the record's own mark and declines the instruction. So this is a CANARY over a property that
	 * currently holds robustly, not a guard with demonstrated sensitivity, and it must not be
	 * described as one. What IS demonstrated is that the oracle is reachable: pointing the mixed case
	 * at a question no drug order can answer reddens it on sample 1
	 * (<em>"No weight measurements are recorded."</em>). Both folds this direction exists for were
	 * seen on the standalone's real charts, which are far larger and noisier than these two rows; an
	 * attempt to make the case discriminate should move the ARRANGEMENT, never loosen the oracle.
	 *
	 * <p>Opt-in like the two above, and skipped without an endpoint.

	 * <strong>The CONVERSE direction on the arrangement where the fold actually reproduced</strong> —
	 * a MIXED chart: one ended prescription (Triomune-30, marked not in force) beside one live
	 * prescription of a different drug (Aspirin, marked in force), asked the currency-shaped
	 * question. The answer must still name the live drug.
	 *
	 * <p>This is the shape both reverted attempts folded on, and both folded the same way: the live
	 * drug LEFT the answer. ADR Decision 45's clause answered <em>"the patient is currently taking
	 * Simvastatin"</em> about a lapsed drug on a chart whose two live drugs it had dropped; issue
	 * #317's wording A/B found four candidate mark labels each answering <em>"No active medications
	 * are recorded"</em> for a patient with two live prescriptions, 3/3 on every one. Neither fold
	 * needs the answer to say anything false ABOUT the live drug — it simply stops mentioning it — so
	 * the assertion is that the live drug is named, and there is deliberately no attempt to check
	 * what is said about it. On a two-drug answer that would need sentence splitting, and
	 * <em>"The patient is taking Aspirin [2]; Triomune-30 was stopped [1]"</em> is one clause away
	 * from being read as an ending attached to Aspirin.
	 *
	 * <p>The ended row is asserted to be marked too, so this is not the single-order case with an
	 * extra document: the clause has something to fire on, and the question is whether it stays
	 * where it belongs.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>Sensitivity: read
	 * {@link #anAnswerOverAChartOfOneLiveOrderReportsItAsCurrent}'s javadoc.</strong> The same four
	 * mutations leave this case green too, the mark rename among them. Its oracle IS reachable —
	 * asked a question no drug order can answer, it reddens on sample 1 — so what is unproven is this
	 * fixture's ability to reproduce the fold, not the assertion.
