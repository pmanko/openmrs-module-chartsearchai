 * <p><b>Over the real pipeline and its own data</b>, which is what makes it worth having beside
 * {@code LlmProviderUserMessageTest}: that class puts a literal chart string to
 * {@code buildUserMessage} and so pins the RENDERING, while nothing there can tell whether the flag
 * production computes is ever true. This drives
 * {@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.injectedFindingsOver} — {@code validate} then
 * {@code injectRecords} over the bundled knowledge base — and puts the resulting chart to the
 * predicate the two answer paths call, so the two halves of the gate are checked against each other
 * rather than each against a fixture. Every arrangement below asserts its own PREMISE off the
 * injected chart first, so a case cannot start passing because the shipped data stopped raising the
 * findings it is about.
 *
 * <p><b>One case here is not about the clause at all</b>, and its own javadoc says so:
 * {@link #theSharedWalkHandsTheFindingsBackInTheOrderTheInjectorWroteThem} pins the ORDER contract
 * of the shared walk both halves of the gate read, which is the property of it a real injected chart
 * can show and a hand-crafted mapping list cannot.
 *
 * <p>Neuter {@code LlmInferenceService.severalFindingsAboutOneDrug} to a constant and read the
 * failures — every clause case here asserts that predicate directly, so either constant reddens
 * this class. Neither reddens anything in {@code LlmProviderUserMessageTest}, which passes the flag as a
 * literal and never asks the predicate at all. The two cases that drive the real {@code search}
 * assert the flag the CALL SITES hand the provider, in both directions, which is a different
 * mutation: a literal at a call site leaves the predicate itself untouched.

	/**
	 * THE SHARED WALK HANDS THE FINDINGS BACK IN THE ORDER THE INJECTOR WROTE THEM, which is a
	 * contract {@code ChartSearchAiUtils.safetyFindingMappings} STATES and nothing observed:
	 * re-collecting it in reverse — {@code findings.add(0, mapping)} — left the whole build green.
	 * Issue <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/397">#397</a>.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What rests on it.</b> The uncited indexes {@code measureFindingCitations} names at WARN
	 * are the one thing a maintainer has for WHICH finding an answer dropped, and that method builds
	 * them off this walk precisely so the order it promises is the one pinned here. Reversed, that
	 * line reads backwards against the prompt with every column of
	 * {@code findingCitations} unchanged — the gate reads {@code size()} and the subject cases
	 * compare against a Set, both of which ignore order. And the extraction's own argument is that
	 * further projections will be added off this one walk, so without this each would inherit an
	 * order premise nothing could see.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Two independent witnesses, which is what makes this a pin rather than a tautology.</b>
	 * {@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.injectedFindings} filters {@code chart.getMappings()} itself
	 * and never through the shared walk, so it reports the order the real injector wrote; the
	 * ascending assertion beside it is the premise that those indexes are the injector's own
	 * sequential numbering, without which a reversal would be unobservable in the values.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The walk is asserted DIRECTLY, List against List, and that is what a downstream
	 * collection cannot get in the way of.</b> Before it existed, the only assertion here went
	 * through {@code SafetyFindingCitationExtentCheck.carriedFindingIndexes} and its
	 * {@code LinkedHashSet}, and that made the pin disarmable in one token: with a {@code HashSet} in
	 * its place the REVERSAL of the shared walk was GREEN — measured, the two edits applied together
	 * in one run — so the swap did not merely leave a collection-type claim unpinned, it took the
	 * order pin off. The escape
	 * was a property of these index VALUES and not structural: this chart's findings are numbered
	 * 4-7, which a {@code HashSet} iterates ascending whichever order they went in, while the same
	 * substitution over the SEVEN indexes 349-355 that the eval rig's own safety findings occupy —
	 * read off
	 * {@code eval/drift-metric/fixtures/probe-safety/findings-complete/sarah__safety-Amlodipine.json},
	 * the largest such population any committed capture carries and none of them reaching an index
	 * above 355 — iterates
	 * {@code [352, 353, 354, 355, 349, 350, 351]}, equally not ascending. Both legs are kept and
	 * they ask different questions: the direct one is the ORDER pin, and the
	 * {@code carriedFindingIndexes} one is CONTENT only, asserting that the projection neither drops
	 * an index nor adds one.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Both sides of that leg are SORTED, and that is deliberate rather than convenient.</b> It
	 * compared the projection's iteration ORDER until #397's hardening changed it, and a mutation
	 * changing only that order — collecting the projection from a reversed copy with the shared walk
	 * untouched, so no index is dropped and none added — reddened it saying the projection had
	 * dropped or added one: {@code expected: <[4, 5, 6, 7]> but was: <[7, 6, 5, 4]>}, measured, and
	 * the one failure in the whole api suite. Nothing reads that order: production asks the
	 * projection for nothing at all, the gate counting the shared walk's own records, and the check
	 * that shares its private step reads only {@code isEmpty()}, {@code contains} and
	 * {@code size()}. Sorted at both ends, that same mutation leaves the whole api suite green while
	 * a DROP and an ADD each still redden this leg (one mutation per run, measured). So a
	 * {@code HashSet} or a {@code TreeSet} inside {@code carriedFindingIndexes} is unreachable from
	 * this case, by design rather than as a gap — and nothing here holds the returned SET to the
	 * prompt's order, so a caller that comes to depend on it brings its own pin.
	 *
	 * <p>The two substitutions were never equivalent, which is why the escape above is worth
	 * spelling out. A {@code TreeSet} or a sort is the STRUCTURAL case: it would have been green
	 * under the old order-reading leg on any chart, normalising to the ascending order that leg
	 * expected whatever the values. The {@code HashSet} was green only because these values happen
	 * to hash ascending — hence the 349-355 counterexample.

	 * <p>The two cases above assert the flag the two ANSWER call sites hand the provider. The
	 * preview pass in {@code LlmInferenceService.maybeEmitPreliminaryReasoning} hands a literal

	 * be seen by a case whose chart carries no finding — both values are {@code false} there — so
	 * this case is the one arrangement that tells them apart: the committed answer's chart is the
	 * real injector's several-findings-one-drug chart, so its flag is {@code true}, while the
	 * focused slice the preview reads carries no finding at all.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The focused slice cannot carry one, and that is the load-bearing reason for the
	 * literal.</b> {@code ChartBuildingStrategy.buildFocusedChart} goes to
	 * {@code QueryStoreChartBuilder.buildFocused}, which never calls the injector — the sole
	 * producer of {@code safety_finding} mappings — so the preview prompt has nothing to enumerate
	 * and the sentence would be spent on the one pass that shares llama-server's single slot with
	 * the committed answer. The harness serves the un-injected base chart there for exactly that
	 * shape.
	 *
	 * <p>Both premises are asserted: two streaming passes reached the provider (the preview is
	 * inside its own try/catch, so a skipped one would otherwise leave this case passing on a
	 * single call), and the null KV scope identifies which of them is the preview. Issue
