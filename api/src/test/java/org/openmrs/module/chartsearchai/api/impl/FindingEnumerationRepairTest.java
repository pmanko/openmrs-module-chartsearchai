/**
 * Issue #398. {@code SafetyFindingCitationExtentCheck} made the shortfall MEASURABLE
 * ({@code findingCitations}) and ADR Decision 83 refused to close it, on the grounds that the only
 * lever was prompt wording; ADR Decision 84 then took the one prompt lever that worked and recorded
 * the result as <em>"an improvement and not a fix"</em> — six of twelve corpus cells still state one
 * finding fewer than the prompt carried. Decision 83's own rejected-alternatives section named what
 * would make a further remedy attemptable: <em>"whoever takes it later has a gate to take it
 * against, which is what this key is"</em>. This is that remedy, and the gate is that key.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a repair rather than another wording.</b> Decision 84's ledger is five arms over one
 * corpus and its finding is that POSITION beat wording; the clause's bytes are pinned as a literal
 * by {@code LlmProviderUserMessageTest} precisely so completeness cannot be bought by rewording it,
 * and every remaining prompt-shaped alternative — an ordinal in the record, compacting the slice,
 * reordering it, a general format rule — is refused there with its own reason. What none of them
 * refuses is asking again: the module already knows, deterministically and before it publishes
 * anything, WHICH findings the answer left uncited.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it appends rather than replaces.</b> {@code searchStreaming} hands the answer to the
 * caller token by token, so by the time the shortfall is knowable the user has already watched the
 * short answer being written; replacing it is available on {@code search} and on that path only, and
 * two answer paths that differ in what they do with a repair is the divergence this package's rules
 * warn about throughout. A continuation is the one shape both paths can carry, and it keeps the
 * answer wholly model-authored — this module never writes clinical prose into an answer, which is
 * what {@code safetyWarnings} exists to do instead.
 *
 * <p><b>What this class does NOT establish.</b> That the repair improves the corpus. It pins the
 * mechanism — that the omitted findings are named, that a second call is made only when one is
 * owed, that a continuation buying nothing is discarded — and the corpus question is
 * {@code eval/drift-metric/capture_probe_safety.sh}'s, read beside {@code unstatedFindingSeverities}
 * and the verdict-lead cell, which are the two columns Decision 84 records regressions in.
