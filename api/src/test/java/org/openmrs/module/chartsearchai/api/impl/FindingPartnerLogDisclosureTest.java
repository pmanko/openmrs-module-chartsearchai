/**
 * What {@link FindingPartnerCoverageCheck} may write to the server log about a patient
 * (issue <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/439">#439</a>).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> The shortfall WARN carried the {@code unstated} list itself — the names of
 * the active orders the prose left out — on the reasoning, written into the comment above it, that a
 * partner name is "this module's own reference vocabulary, not the patient's data". The vocabulary is
 * the module's; WHICH of its words appear is decided entirely by what this patient is prescribed, an
 * interaction chip being raised only for a partner the patient actually has an order for. Patient id
 * beside medication names is PHI, and core ships {@code org.openmrs} at WARN, so the line reached the
 * default server log and any log shipping a deployment configures — a wider audience than the
 * clinicians holding <i>AI Query Patient Data</i>.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing is lost by taking the names out.</b> ADR Decision 100 has the module APPEND them to
 * the answer, so the reader who holds the privilege already receives every name; the counts the log
 * keeps are the two {@code findingPartners} publishes. {@link #theOrdersReachTheAnswerAClinicianIsHanded}
 * and {@link #searchStreaming_theOrdersReachTheAnswerItReturns} are what make that a move rather than
 * a deletion — remove the append and they redden, so a fix that simply stopped naming the orders
 * anywhere cannot pass this file. They assert it of the answer each method RETURNS; the one surface
 * that does not carry the appended sentence is the early {@code done} the REST layer emits under
 * {@code chartsearchai.grounding.async=true}, and ADR Decision 102 states that residue rather than
 * this file pinning it, since pinning it would forbid the fix.
 *
 * <p>Everything here runs the real {@link LlmInferenceService#search}/{@code searchStreaming}
 * orchestration over real merged chips the real {@code DrugSafetyValidator} raised from the shared
 * fixture ({@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.sharedMechanismInteractionChips}). Only the model is
 * stubbed: answer prose is not reproducible on a live engine, and the answer is the one input this
 * check reads.

	/** The module ROOT, so the claim is about every logger a pass writes from and not only this
	 *  check's — a name leaking from a neighbour is the same disclosure.
	 *
	 *  <p><b>What this scope reaches, measured rather than reasoned.</b> Every event these cases
	 *  captured on 2026-09-16 came from three loggers, all inside {@code ...api.impl}:
	 *  {@code LlmInferenceService}, {@code ReferenceProseFidelityCheck} and the check itself. The
	 *  answer path's other half — the validator and the injector, which log from
	 *  {@code ...chartsearchai.reference} — is stubbed out below, so naming the root reaches nothing
	 *  there, and those two sites are pinned where they are written:
	 *  {@code ActiveOrderReconciliationTest.theReconciliationWarnIdentifiesTheOrderByUuidAndNeverByItsDrugName}
	 *  and {@code PairChipCapContextTest.theScreeningWarnRatesTheWithheldPairsAtTheConfiguredCapAndNamesNoDrug}.
	 *  The root is named anyway because the alternative scopes the negative to the package this
	 *  harness happens to log from today, and nothing brings a maintainer back to the constant when a
	 *  later pass logs from somewhere else in the module.
	 *
	 *  <p>An earlier round of this PR named {@code ...api.impl} and recorded the root as tried and
	 *  reverted, a root capture having received this pass's WARN but not its INFO or DEBUG once the
	 *  whole suite ran. The cause was the {@link LogCapture} defect round 3 found — a
	 *  {@code LoggerConfig} a sibling file's class-named capture left installed, which
	 *  {@link LogCapture#close()} now removes ({@code LogCaptureRestorationTest}) — so that
	 *  measurement went with the fix, and the paragraph recording it goes here. */
