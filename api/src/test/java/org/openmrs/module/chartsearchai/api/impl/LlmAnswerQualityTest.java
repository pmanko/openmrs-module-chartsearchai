	 *
	 * <p>{@code String.replace} returns the ORIGINAL string when the needle is absent, so a
	 * substitution anchored on a sentence that has drifted out of
	 * {@link LlmProvider#DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT} simply does not happen, and nothing says so: the run
	 * compares four prompts believing it has four variants, and every number it prints is
	 * well-formed. An arm whose ONLY edit drifts is byte-identical to the baseline arm, which is what
	 * the assertions here catch. The fourth arm was subtler and is why {@link #replaceOrFail} exists:
	 * it anchored on {@code "Answer ONLY the specific question asked."} while the prompt says
	 * {@code "Answer ONLY the specific query."}, and its SECOND substitution did apply — so it
	 * differed from the baseline and from its siblings while missing the trend instruction that is
	 * its whole reason to exist as a separate arm (issue #126).</p>
	 *
	 * <p>One assertion per arm, against the baseline and against each other: an arm that duplicates a
	 * sibling is the same vacuous comparison one step removed. Building the arms at all is the other
	 * half of the check — {@code replaceOrFail} throws on a needle the prompt no longer contains.</p>
