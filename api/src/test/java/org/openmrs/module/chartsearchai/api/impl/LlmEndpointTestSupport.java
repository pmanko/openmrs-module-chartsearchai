/**
 * The one OpenAI-compatible-endpoint client for the opt-in LLM test suites — resolving the endpoint,
 * probing it, deciding whether the suite was opted into, and posting one completion. Shared by
 * {@link LlmAnswerQualityTest}, {@link PromptInjectionEvalTest}, {@link AbsentDataEvalTest},
 * {@link EndedOrderAnswerRuleTest} and {@link ReferenceRecordAttributionAnswerTest} so the request
 * shape cannot drift between them, which is the rule CLAUDE.md states for {@code TestDatasetHelper}
 * and {@code DrugReferenceTestSupport}.
 *
 * <p>Extracted when {@link AbsentDataEvalTest} became the third suite to need it (issue #203); the
 * first two had a copy each. It matters more here than the line count suggests, because all three
 * suites are <b>skipped unless opted into</b>: a divergence between three copies of the request shape
 * would not turn CI red, so the copies could disagree indefinitely about what "the same call" means —
 * and comparing results across suites would then be comparing different requests.
 *
 * <p>This is a transport helper, not a pipeline stand-in. The prompt bytes, the response parsing and
 * the assertions all stay in the suites and go through real production code ({@link
 * LlmProvider#DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT}, {@link LlmProvider#buildUserMessage}, {@code extractResponse}).
