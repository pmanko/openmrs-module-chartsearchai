 * the module has itself resolved a drug-safety question, the answer is composed from the module's own
 * findings and the model is not asked to restate them. ADR Decision 108 records the bound and what it
 * reverses.
 *
 * <p><b>Everything but the model is real.</b> Patient 7 of the standard dataset (active order 111,
 * ASPIRIN) read through the real {@code OrderService} by the real injector's
 * {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder}, the real {@code DrugSafetyValidator} over the DDInter excerpt
 * the tests load, and the real {@link LlmInferenceService#search}/{@code searchStreaming}. The model
 * is a recorder: every case asserts whether it was ASKED, which is the behaviour the issue is about,
 * and the finding records a composed answer must carry are read off the chart that recorder was handed
 * on a run with the property off — so they are the records production wrote, never a copy.
