/**
 * A chart the module could not read says so ON THE ANSWER (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/247">#247</a> item 1).
 *
 * <p>The defect these cases pin is not that the safety layer fails — it is additive and failing
 * safe is correct — but that it fails INDISTINGUISHABLY. A failed allergy, condition or
 * active-order read degrades to an empty set, so the response carries no chips, no findings and,
 * before this key, nothing at all to separate that from a patient who is genuinely on nothing and
 * allergic to nothing. The issue's own measurement is the table in its first comment: read-failed
 * and healthy-chart were the same response.
 *
 * <p><b>The REAL injector and the REAL validator over one service</b>, for the reason
 * {@code LlmInferenceServiceFindingProvenanceContextTest} states: the verdict is collected by
 * {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder} from real service reads, so a pass-through injector would
 * leave the whole seam inert. Patient 7 is persisted, which a detached {@code new Patient()} is
 * not.
 *
 * <p>The read is failed the way production fails it — a {@code UserContext} refusing exactly the
 * one {@code @Authorized} privilege core annotates the service call with, the technique
 * {@code StandingChartAlertsToggleContextTest} uses for the same three reads.
