/**
 * Issue <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/378">#378</a>'s
 * statement travelling from the dataset that was loaded to the answer the REST layer publishes it
 * from.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the answer carries it at all.</b> Under the shipped {@code sourceFormat=ddinter}
 * default the dataset publishes no hand-authored allergy or condition rule, so the contraindication
 * screen's condition leg has no rule to evaluate and this patient's recorded conditions are put to
 * nothing — while {@code interactionPairs} beside it states a completeness the interaction arm
 * genuinely had. The verdict already existed at load time, on
 * {@code GET /chartsearchai/drugreferencestatus}; what it had was no reader on the surface a
 * clinician's client reads. These cases pin the CARRYING, which is the step issues #178, #229 and
 * #354 each record as their own root cause: the value existed inside the pipeline and nothing
 * brought it out.
 *
 * <p><b>Context-sensitive deliberately, and it is not a shortcut.</b> The verdict is read off
 * {@code DrugReferenceService.getLoadStatus()}, whose load is lazy and gated on
 * {@code chartsearchai.drugReference.enabled} — a global property defaulting to {@code false}. So no
 * plain unit test can reach anything but {@link DrugReferenceLoad.Coverage#UNLOADED} here, and the
 * seams that inject entries directly ({@code DrugReferenceService.setEntries}, and so
 * {@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.ddinterService()}) deliberately pair those entries with
 * {@code DrugReferenceLoad.notLoaded()} — the same value again. The only arrangement that exercises
 * a REAL load is this one: the global property on, and the module's own bundled dataset read by the
 * production loader. {@code ShippedDrugReferenceDefaultTest} is that arrangement one layer down.
 *
 * <p>What these cases do NOT pin is the wire shape; that is
 * {@code ChartSearchAiConditionRuleCoverageTest} in the omod module, which drives the controller.
