/**
 * The chips an answer carries say which of them the module raised from one of the patient's own active
 * orders, on issue <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/527">#527</a>'s
 * own shape: two patients, one allergy, one sentence.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is asked of the answer's chips and not of the injected record.</b> The wire publishes each
 * chip's {@link SafetyWarning#isAboutACurrentMedication()}, and on the model's path the chips an answer
 * carries come from the pass that has read the MODEL's answer — not from the pass the record the model read
 * was rendered from. That pass puts in play every drug the answer names that no record the answer is
 * attributable to names, and the drug-in-play arm raises such a drug's findings as a proposal's (see the
 * accessor). The issue's answer named the very drug its chip was about — <em>"Yes — an allergy is
 * recorded: Ibuprofen (drug allergen) [1]."</em> — so what the first case pins is that an answer naming
 * that drug leaves the published chip raised from her order. Two records the answer is attributable to
 * name it here, the allergy record it cites and the finding's own injected record, and either alone
 * keeps the drug out of play; take both out of the attributable corpus and the case reddens.
 *
 * <p><b>These cases are not the failing specification</b>: the flag was set this way before the issue, and
 * what the issue changed is that the wire carries it, which
 * {@code ChartSearchAiCurrentMedicationReferentTest} in the omod module specifies. They pin the premise that
 * key's meaning rests on, through the real pipeline.
 *
 * <p><b>Everything but the model is real</b>: patients 7 (active order 111, ASPIRIN) and 6 (no order) of
 * the standard dataset, each with a free-text aspirin allergy saved through {@code PatientService}, the
 * real injector and validator over the DDInter excerpt the tests load, and the real
 * {@link LlmInferenceService#search}. The chart the stub strategy returns carries the allergy record and,
 * for patient 7, her order's record. The model is a recorder answering the issue's recorded words.
