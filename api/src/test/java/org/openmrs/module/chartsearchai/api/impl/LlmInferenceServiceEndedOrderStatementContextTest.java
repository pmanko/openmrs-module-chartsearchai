 * An answer that treats a drug the chart holds only as an ended order as current is completed by the

 * (issue <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/472">#472</a>, ADR
 * Decision 110).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> Decision 110's live A/B recorded the shipped prompt's answer to <em>"Her current
 * medications are lamivudine, nevirapine and rifampicin. Any interactions?"</em> as <em>"Yes, there are
 * interactions recorded for these medications."</em> — the refusal gone, and the clinician's false
 * premise that rifampicin is current still confirmed. The chip said {@code aboutAnEndedOrder: true};
 * nothing a clinician reads said so. The module holds the fact structurally, on the chip, so it states
 * it the way ADR Decision 100 states an order the prose left unnamed: appended, never replacing, with
 * no model asked.
 *
 * <p><b>Everything but the model is real</b>: patient 7 of the standard dataset (active order 111,
 * ASPIRIN) read through the real {@code OrderService}, the real injector and validator over the DDInter
 * excerpt the tests load, and the real {@link LlmInferenceService#search}/{@code searchStreaming}. The
 * chart the stub strategy returns carries an ended Ibuprofen order in querystore's REAL rendered text, or,
 * in the cases about a name Omeprazole shares with another drug, an ended Omeprazole order.
 * The model is a recorder answering R1's recorded words.
