/**
 * Issue <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/305">#305</a> on the
 * surface it is about: the chart record a cited finding fired on reaches the answer's REFERENCE list,
 * so the clinician's click-through no longer depends on the model having cited it.
 *
 * <p><b>The measured defect.</b> Two wordings of one question, a single character apart, returned
 * different reference sets over many identical runs each, with everything upstream of the model
 * byte-identical — so the divergence was entirely in whether the model put the record in its
 * structured {@code citations} array. ADR Decision 80 has the counts and the arrangement.
 *
 * <p><b>The stub provider is the second form.</b> It answers in the issue's own words, asserts the
 * allergy, and cites the finding ALONE — reading the finding's number out of the numbered records it
 * is handed rather than hardcoding an index, so a change to how many records the injector appends
 * cannot quietly turn the arrangement into one that cites nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>Context-sensitive with the REAL injector and validator</b>, unlike its sibling statement
 * tests, and that is not a shortcut: the provenance is collected by
 * {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder} from a real {@code Allergy} read through
 * {@code PatientService}, so a pass-through injector or a stubbed validator would leave the whole
 * seam inert. The patient is patient 7 — persisted, because a detached {@code new Patient()} cannot
 * carry a saved allergy for the builder to read.
