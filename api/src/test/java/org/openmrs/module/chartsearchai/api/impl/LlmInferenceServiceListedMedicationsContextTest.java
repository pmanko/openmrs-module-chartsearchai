 * A question that lists the patient's medications is held to her chart, not to the list — issue

 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> <em>"The patient is currently on Lamivudine, Nevirapine, Stavudine, is it safe to
 * give Amlodipine?"</em>, asked of a patient whose chart holds none of the three and does hold a
 * rifampicin-containing order, came back from the default model as <em>"Amlodipine can be given, with one
 * caution: coadministration with nevirapine may decrease…"</em>. The chips beside it held Amlodipine ×
 * rifampin, a Major finding whose record the model had read ending <em>"This finding is a reason to
 * withhold it."</em>. Nothing in the response said the chart holds no order for the listed drugs, and no
 * key compared the lead with that finding.
 *
 * <p><b>Everything but the model is real</b>: patient 7 of the standard dataset with the issue's
 * rifampicin-containing order added ({@value #RIFAMPICIN_ORDER}) beside her aspirin order 111, read
 * through the real {@code OrderService}; the real injector and validator over a verbatim slice of the
 * shipped knowledge base ({@value #SLICE}); and the real {@link LlmInferenceService#search} and
 * {@code searchStreaming}. The model is a recorder answering the issue's recorded words, and it keeps
 * the prompt it was handed, which is where a case reads the number of the finding it expects reported.
