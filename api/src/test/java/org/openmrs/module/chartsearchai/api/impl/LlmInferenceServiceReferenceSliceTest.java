/**
 * Issue #229 — the injected reference slice's size travelling from the chart the LLM actually saw to
 * the answer the REST layer files an audit row from.
 *
 * <p>The measurement itself is pinned in {@code InjectedReferenceSliceTest}; what these cases pin is
 * the CARRYING, which is the step #229 names as its own root cause — the number existed inside the
 * injector and nothing brought it out. Two things have to hold, and they are the two that came apart
 * for this row's sibling field in issue #178.
 *
 * <p><b>It is resolved off the POST-inject chart.</b> The strategy here builds a chart with no
 * reference material and the injector seam returns one the REAL injector produced, so a slice
 * resolved before {@code inject()} reports zero and both ordering cases below fail — measured, and
 * stated as two rather than as "every case here", because the third pins the producer-side
 * null-versus-zero contract on a directly constructed answer and no ordering can move it. That is deliberate:
 * a seam returning the chart unchanged — which is what every other test in this package installs —
 * cannot tell the two orderings apart, so those cases would stay green under exactly the mutation
 * {@code LlmInferenceService}'s own comment guards ("After inject() deliberately: that is the chart
 * the LLM sees").
 *
 * <p><b>The streaming path's two answers carry the SAME slice object.</b> It persists ONE audit row
 * from ONE of two {@link ChartAnswer}s depending on whether async grounding is active, so the two
 * must agree. Identity rather than equality is what pins the mechanism: two independent derivations
 * over one chart are equal, so an equality check on the numbers stays green under a second
 * resolution at the ungrounded site — measured — and would state a guard that is not there.
