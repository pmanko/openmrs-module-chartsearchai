/**
 * Issue #354's statement travelling from the chart the model was given to the answer the REST layer
 * publishes it from.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the answer carries it at all.</b> The deterministic half of #354 is one injected
 * {@code drug_class_note} record, and an injected record reaches a client only if the model CITES
 * it: the {@code /search} response returns cited references and nothing else. On the issue's own
 * reproduction the model cited nothing and answered that the records did not address the question,
 * so the whole change was invisible to a {@code /search} consumer — the same "the module is silent
 * about what it did" failure issue #336 answered with a deterministic response key. These cases pin
 * the module's own statement, which no answer wording can withhold.
 *
 * <p>What they do NOT pin is the wire shape; that is
 * {@code ChartSearchAiUnresolvedDrugClassTest} in the omod module, which drives the controller.
 * Here the subject is the CARRYING — the step #178 and #229 each record as their own root cause,
 * where the number existed inside the pipeline and nothing brought it out.
