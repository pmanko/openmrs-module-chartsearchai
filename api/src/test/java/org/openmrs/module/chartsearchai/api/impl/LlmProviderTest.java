		// clause sitting in front of evidence that contradicts it. The same build answered the
		// ibuprofen equivalent cleanly, so the substance was right and only the framing failed.
		//
		// Cause: the abstention rule's precondition is "no record addresses the drug asked about", and
		// a safety-finding record IS such a record — but the prompt describes what a "Drug reference"
		// record is and says nothing about "Safety finding", a type this change introduced. With no

		// appends the finding it cannot ignore.
		//
		// So this is a record-TYPE description, deliberately not another verdict or wording rule: four

		// verdict-lead deferral inherited a YES criterion that inverts on safety questions; an

		// active order simvastatin — Major. Coadministration with potent inhibitors of CYP450 3A4
		// may significantly increase the plasma concentrations of simvastatin..." The words "not
		// safe", "avoid" and "No" never appeared: the clinical call existed only on the chip.
		//
		// Cause: that is literal compliance with the record-type sentence #110 added, which told the
		// model to "open with what the finding says". The mechanism was therefore occupying the
		// verdict slot. The safety/suitability rule below it covers only the UNADDRESSED branch
		// ("when no record addresses the drug ... never Yes or No") and the only safety few-shot is
		// the mango abstention, so nothing described or demonstrated the addressed branch.
		//
		// So the finding's lead is re-pointed at the verdict and the addressed branch is written and
		// demonstrated. THREE constraints come from the arms measured and reverted on 2026-07-30
		// (eval/drift-metric/README.md, "the two-hop join is impossible"), and each one below carries
		// its own assertion because a mutation probe showed none of them was pinned. Seven shapes this
		// change must resist all left `mvn test` green: deleting any of its five load-bearing clauses
		// from DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT — including the never-"Yes" token — plus appending a fallback in
		// wording other than arm D's, plus splitting the addressed branch into a paragraph of its own.
		// Two more are why the few-shot's record prefix is now one shared constant rather than a copy:
		// rewording DrugReferenceInjector.renderFinding's prefix out from under the demonstration, and
		// re-inlining a literal into the prompt and then rewording that prefix. All nine were run
		// against these assertions and every one fails.
		//   * The verdict's DIRECTION must come from the finding, never by deferring to the general
		//     yes/no rule: that rule's "start with Yes ONLY when a record explicitly names what is
		//     asked" is a PRESENCE criterion, and on a safety question a record naming the drug is
		//     evidence AGAINST it. Arm C of the A/B/C/D deferred and produced an inverted
		//     "Yes ... ivosidenib (Major...)" 5/6 for a patient on simvastatin.
		//   * Hence the never-"Yes" token, and it must stay a TOKEN rather than a quoted sentence
		//     template: arm B forbade a meta-lead by quoting it and the model then emitted that exact
		//     string 6/6 on a cell that never had it. The README draws that distinction explicitly.
		//   * The rule's precondition must stay "a safety finding names the drug asked about" with no
		//     otherwise-branch. Arm D's "otherwise state what the record shows" made drug-reference
		//     material fair game and broke the #107 abstention on 3 unconnected cells. Gated on a

	/**
	 * THE FLAG THIS METHOD IS HANDED REACHES THE MESSAGE IT SENDS THE ENGINE — issue
	 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/397">#397</a>'s last
	 * unguarded hop, and the only one of its chain that no case observed.
	 *
	 * <p>Every other link was pinned before this one: the gate's read position and both call sites
	 * by {@code FindingEnumerationClauseContextTest}, and the append condition inside
	 * {@code buildUserMessage} by {@code AbsentDataEvalTest} and
	 * {@code LlmProviderUserMessageTest}. This one — {@code search}'s own parameter reaching the
	 * builder — was covered by nothing in either direction. Measured, review round 3: replacing
	 * {@code buildUserMessage(numberedRecords, focusIndices, question, enumerateFindings)} with the
	 * retained flag-less 3-arg arity in BOTH {@code search} and {@code searchStreaming} left the
	 * whole root build green, totals identical to the baseline's. That is a one-token edit — a
	 * refactor deduplicating the two identical calls, or a cleanup of what reads as a redundant
	 * 4-arg overload — and it reverts this issue's entire production payload while the gate still
	 * computes the flag and both call sites still hand it over.
	 *
	 * <p>{@code FindingEnumerationClauseContextTest} cannot see it: its {@code RecordingProvider}
	 * OVERRIDES {@code search} and {@code searchStreaming}, so these bodies never execute there.
	 * This class is where they do.
	 *
	 * <p>Asserted as equality with the flag-true build and INEQUALITY with the flag-false one. The
	 * second half is what stops the case going vacuous if the clause is ever ungated or deleted:
	 * without it both sides move together and the equality passes over two clause-free messages.
	 * Measured — deleting the append block from {@code buildUserMessage} reddens this case and its
	 * streaming sibling, on that assertion.
	 *
	 * <p>Every direction of both hops was mutated and the failures read.
	 * At {@code search}: the flag-less arity or a literal {@code false} reddens THIS case, and a
	 * literal {@code true} reddens {@code search_withTheFlagFalseSendsTheMessageItSentBeforeThisFeatureExisted}.
	 * At {@code searchStreaming}: the flag-less arity or {@code false} reddens
	 * {@code searchStreaming_forwardsTheFindingEnumerationFlagToTheMessageAndNeverToTheKvSeed}, and
	 * {@code true} reddens {@code searchStreaming_scopeAware_forwardsScopeAndQuestionIndependentSeedToEngine},
	 * which was already the only case in the suite running a real provider body through a capturing
	 * engine — and it passes {@code false}, which is why it could see only that one direction.
