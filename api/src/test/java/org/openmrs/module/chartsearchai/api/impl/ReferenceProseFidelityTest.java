/**
 * Issue #337: the model reproduces a deterministic safety finding's mechanism and then writes its
 * own words inside the sentence it was copying, deleting the hazard. Measured live on the 3.7.1
 * standalone: the chip said <em>"…oxidizing agents that can also <b>induce methemoglobinemia</b>
 * such as antimalarials…"</em> and the answer, citing that finding, said <em>"…oxidizing agents
 * that can also <b>increase the risk</b>"</em> — the risk of what is no longer in the sentence a
 * clinician reads. A second capture deleted <em>"aminoglycoside antibiotics"</em> from a botulinum
 * toxin warning whose partner IS an aminoglycoside.
 *
 * <p>Nothing in the pipeline could see it, and the README claimed something could. A
 * reference-group citation skips Tier-2 entailment entirely and Tier-1 cosine barely moves when one
 * phrase inside a long recitation changes; {@link ClassCodeFidelityCheck} compares one token shape
 * and says nothing about prose; the {@code safetyWarnings} chips are a parallel list nothing
 * reconciles against the answer.
 *
 * <p>What this file pins is the deterministic check that closes the mechanism gap: when an answer
 * REPRODUCES a stretch of a cited reference record and then, inside the same sentence on both
 * sides, states different words, that is reported at WARN. Everything else is silence — an answer
 * that reproduces nothing, one that stops copying and ends its sentence, one that reproduces a
 * record sentence whole and moves on, and one whose continuation ANOTHER cited record explains.
 * The answer prose is never rewritten. What DOES reach the wire, since the second round of #337, is
 * the citation the check named — not a word of either text; the cases at the top of this file pin
 * that statement and {@code ChartSearchAiUnfaithfulRenderingTest} pins its wire shape.
 *
 * <p>Every case runs through the real {@link LlmInferenceService#search}/{@code searchStreaming}
 * orchestration, and the ones about the defect run over REAL production-rendered records: the cited
 * finding and the drug-reference record beside it are what the real validate → injectRecords →
 * renderFinding chain produces off the bundled DDInter excerpt for a patient on tramadol asked
 * about sertraline, and their canned answers are sliced out of that record's own text at run time
 * rather than transcribed, so the arrangement cannot drift from the dataset. FOUR cases ASSEMBLE
 * their record instead — the chart-record scope case, the two pooling legs and the unreadable-record
 * case — because the shapes they need do not occur in a sixteen-entry excerpt; each says so where it
 * stands, and the check is a pure function of an answer and a record's TEXT, so an assembled operand
 * is the right one for them. The model is stubbed because answer prose is not reproducible on a live
 * engine; the chart builder, the injector and the validator are stubbed too, as in the sibling
 * suite, so the one variable under test is the answer.

	 * truncated allergen, in one sentence.
	 * The repetition cuts this answer's agreement with the record it is about into runs below the
	 * floor, so the check declines at its gate and states nothing about it — the residue ADR
	 * Decision 61 records as a substitution inside a reproduction shorter than twelve words, met here
	 * by the defect that sits earlier in the same sentence. It is not a claim about every answer
	 * carrying both defects: one that also diverged from the record inside a long enough reproduction
	 * elsewhere would be reported for that.
	 *
	 * <p>The answer is TRANSCRIBED rather than sliced out of the record at run time, because it is
	 * the historical capture the decision is about. What holds it to the dataset is the control
	 * below: collapse the repetition and the same words must be REPORTED, which they can only be
	 * by reproducing the record. Let the rendered sentence drift and the control reddens.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The clause, against a two-row slice — which is not the whole capture against the whole
	 * chart, and the gate differs.</b> Here nothing of the record survives at the floor, so the check
	 * declines before comparing. On the full six-clause answer over the arrangement ADR Decision 59
	 * describes, its sixth clause DOES reproduce one other finding's record to the floor, so the check
	 * compares and finds no divergence — the run the truncated allergen ends being seven words, under
	 * the floor. Two gates, one silence, and the section says which is which.
	 *
	 * <p>WHICH silence it is, asserted rather than assumed, as the three declining cases above do.
	 * It captures the check's own logger and not {@link #PACKAGE}, which the other silence cases
	 * here use: {@code ClassCodeFidelityCheck} REPORTS this answer, under Decision 59's own
	 * repeated-code rule, so a package-wide silence assertion would fail on a sibling's correct
	 * finding. The {@code PACKAGE} note above covers a literal code written into an answer; a code
