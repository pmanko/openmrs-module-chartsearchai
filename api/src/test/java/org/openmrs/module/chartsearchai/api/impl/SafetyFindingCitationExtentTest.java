/**
 * Issue #395: the prompt carried seven screened interaction findings and the answer stated six,
 * dropping one of them entirely. Measured live on a RefApp 3.7.1 standalone against the bundled
 * knowledge base with the drug-reference layer enabled, two runs byte-identical — a
 * <em>"should i give Amlodipine?"</em> answer that opened <em>"No — Amlodipine should not be
 * given"</em> and enumerated six active orders, each with its own citation and its own rating,
 * while the seventh finding (Amlodipine &harr; Ibuprofen, Moderate, bridged to her active
 * {@code Advil 400mg}) was in the prompt at its own index and reached the prose nowhere.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing on that response could see it, and each for its own correct reason.</b>
 * {@code unstatedFindingSeverities} read {@code []} because it asks of the WHOLE answer whether a
 * finding's rating word appears anywhere and <em>Moderate</em> appeared six times;
 * {@code unfaithfullyRenderedCitations} read {@code []} because the answer reproduced nothing to
 * substitute inside; {@code misattributedOrderCitations} read {@code []} because it judges the
 * citations that ARE offered; {@code interactionPairs} read {@code {found: 7, reported: 7}}, which
 * is true of the screen and says nothing about the prose. The residue was already named — in
 * {@link SafetyFindingSeverityFidelityCheck}'s own javadoc, quoting the prose check's
 * <em>"a hazard dropped by stopping early"</em> — and this file pins the half of it that citation
 * makes deterministic.
 *
 * <p><b>Everything here runs the real orchestration.</b> The chart is the real
 * {@link PatientChartSerializer}'s, the findings are the real
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator} &rarr; {@code injectRecords} &rarr; {@code renderFinding} chain's
 * over the bundled knowledge base, and the extent is read off the {@link ChartAnswer} that the real
 * {@link LlmInferenceService#search}/{@code searchStreaming} returns. Only the model is stubbed:
 * answer prose is not reproducible on a live engine, and the answer is the one variable this
 * measurement is about.
