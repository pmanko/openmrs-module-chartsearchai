/**
 * Issue #337, round three: the answer states a deterministic safety finding and drops the RATING the
 * module wrote into it. Measured live on a RefApp 3.7.1 standalone against the bundled knowledge
 * base, three runs byte-identical — five interaction findings enumerated flat in one clause, no
 * rating stated for any of them, two of them Major.
 *
 * <p>Nothing could see it, and correctly so. {@code ReferenceProseFidelityCheck} reports a
 * SUBSTITUTION inside a long reproduction and that answer reproduced nothing;
 * {@code unfaithfullyRenderedCitations} read {@code []} because the check ran and found no
 * divergence, not because it looked. That carve-out is right for that check — its own javadoc names
 * the residue — and this file pins the half of the residue a rating makes deterministic.
 *
 * <p><b>The arrangement is MIXED-severity, and that is load-bearing rather than incidental.</b> The
 * sibling {@link ActiveOrderCitationFidelityTest}'s partner list rates every finding Major, so a
 * case built on it cannot tell "this record's own rating" from "any rating word at all", and a
 * carrier replaced by the constant {@code "Major"} would stay green on it. The pinned DDInter
 * excerpt rates Clarithromycin's partners across all four classes, so one arrangement here yields
 * Major, Moderate and Minor findings together — asserted in {@link #setUp()}, never assumed — and
 * {@link #anAnswerStatingOneRatingAndNotTheOthersReportsOnlyTheOthers} is what that buys.
 *
 * <p><b>Every case that names a published entry names its RATING too, since issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/387">#387</a></b> — the
 * cases whose claim is an EMPTY statement or none still assert just that. The key published a bare
 * index list until then, and the mixed arrangement above is what makes the pairing checkable at
 * all: {@link #statementsFor} builds the expectation from the ratings the real injector
 * wrote, not from a word this file chose. Mutate the pairing and read the failures — a constant
 * rating and a pairing shifted by one each redden cases here, and on a single-rating arrangement
 * neither could. What this file does NOT hold is which SOURCE the carrier read the rating from: the
 * chip's value and the record's agree except on an operator dataset's padding, so that substitution
 * is caught by {@code SafetyFindingSeverityCarriedContextTest} and not by the spread here.
 *
 * <p>Everything here runs the real {@link LlmInferenceService#search}/{@code searchStreaming}
 * orchestration over a chart the real {@link PatientChartSerializer} rendered and the real
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator} &rarr; {@code injectRecords} &rarr; {@code renderFinding} chain
 * injected findings into. Only the model is stubbed: answer prose is not reproducible on a live
 * engine, and the answer is the one variable this check is about. What the injector WRITES onto each
 * finding, and which ratings it withholds, is {@code SafetyFindingSeverityCarriedContextTest}'s.
