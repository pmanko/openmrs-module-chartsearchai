/**
 * The strength of a safety answer's opening call follows the finding's own stated strength (#283).
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> The addressed-safety branch used to assert, of any finding naming the
 * drug, that "that finding is evidence against giving it, so begin the answer with the call it
 * supports — No", and the one demonstrated safety verdict was a MAJOR finding refusing a delivery. A
 * Minor-rated interaction therefore refused the drug in the same words: measured on the standalone,
 * {@code main} @ b0cfe545, <em>"No — gentamicin should not be given: Gentamicin interacts with active
 * order lidocaine, a Minor interaction"</em>, on a finding whose mechanism text ends "No special
 * precautions are necessary". The severity was deterministic the whole time; only the wording carried
 * the call.
 *
 * <p><b>The caution branch must not be a "Yes", and that is not a wording preference.</b> #107 arm C
 * measured a presence-shaped "Yes" inverting the clinical meaning 5/6 on exactly this question shape,
 * which is why {@code LlmProviderTest} pins the never-"Yes" token. So a finding that withholds
 * nothing still may not produce "Yes": the lead states that the drug can be given and names the
 * caution. Both properties hold together — that is what makes this a gradation rather than a
 * loosening.
 *
 * <p><b>What these assertions are, and are not.</b> They pin the prompt's CONTENT: that the
 * evidence-against claim is now conditional on the strength the finding states, that both strength
 * classes are taught in the words the injected record uses ({@code SafetyFindingSeverityStrengthTest}
 * pins the record side), and that the caution class is demonstrated. Since the two clauses SHARE a
 * phrase — "a reason to withhold it" occurs inside the caution one, negated — they also pin which
 * SENTENCE each phrase sits in, without which the two branches can be swapped and stay green.
 * What the model then produces is measured on a server; a prompt test cannot assert an answer.

	 * clause of a sentence whose whole point is that the clause does not apply, and the
	 * {@code gated > 0} floor below is what stops such a reword turning this case into a vacuous
	 * pass. Two residues that leaves, stated rather than argued away: a positive claim worded around
	 * this literal (<em>"is evidence against that medication"</em>) is matched by no occurrence here,
	 * and a negated occurrence would not be read for what it then instructs
	 * — {@link #assertCurrentMedicationBranch} is what holds the current-medication branches' own

	 * emission ordering rests on something the prompt cannot express, before and after #346 alike.

	 * intact — which leaves the other three green. <b>What this line is not is an exclusion of a
	 * permission</b>, and until round 3 of this PR's hardening this bullet said otherwise: it named
	 * the caution-current branch given the #107 arm-C permission (<em>"open by stating that the drug

	 * wording happens to DROP the literal. Keep the literal and add the permission and this line is
	 * green — which is what the fourth bullet is for.</li>
	 * <li>no {@code "No"} — the refusal lead belongs to the withholding branch and to the older
	 * ranking sentence. This is the assertion {@link #theCautionBranchLeadsWithNeitherARefusalNorAYes}
	 * already carried for the caution branch, whose own comment names the drift as "a refusal creeping

	 * appending <em>"but open with \"No\" where the mechanism is serious"</em> to the shipped branch,
	 * which keeps the lead and the prohibition and reddens this line alone.</li>
	 * <li>the prohibition {@code "never open by refusing to give a drug"} — a positive lead does not
	 * by itself stop the model reaching for the refusal it read two sentences earlier, and this is the
	 * clause that says so. Its witness is deleting exactly that clause from one branch, which reddens
	 * this line alone.</li>
	 * <li>no {@link #proposalCautionPermission()} — the branch may not borrow the lead the
	 * PROPOSAL-caution sentence two sentences earlier is required to use. This is the FAIL-OPEN
	 * direction and the one the three above do not touch: #107 arm C measured a presence-shaped
	 * permission inverting the call 5 of 6 times, and it is the whole reason
	 * {@link DrugReferenceInjector#STRENGTH_CAUTION_CURRENT_MEDICATION} exists rather than the
	 * withholding counterpart alone. Three witnesses, each keeping the other three properties above
	 * intact and each measured to redden THIS line and no other case in this class — and each of the
	 * three was green across the whole api module before this line existed, which is how round 3
	 * found the gap:
	 * <em>"open by naming that the drug can be given and the caution in the same sentence"</em> for
	 * the caution-current branch — the verbatim direction that clause's own javadoc names;
	 * <em>"open by naming it and stating that the medication can be given, with the caution in the

	 * WITHHOLDING-class branch, <em>"open by naming that medication, stating that it can be given,
	 * and what the finding relates it to"</em>, which instructs a permission lead for a Major
	 * screened pair of the patient's own prescriptions — #348's own reproduction cell.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p><b>What these four do NOT catch</b>, since a guard over text has a gap between the property
	 * it means and the string it matches: they are literals, so a semantically equivalent reword —
	 * <em>"do not open by refusing"</em>, or a lead that names the medication in other words — reddens

	 * not scoped to the lead, so a permission stated later in the same sentence reddens it as well.

	 * api module was green on {@code 026613de} and it now reddens, reported (as such a mutation always
	 * is here) against the FIRST it violates, {@code "open by naming"}.

	 * RANKING sentences name
	 * a class core and contain no "open", which is what the loop's second term excludes and what
	 * {@link #aSetMixingAProposalCallAndACurrentMedicationCallIsLedByTheStrongest} guards instead.

	 * #348's own reproduction cell.
