/**
 * Issue <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/560">#560</a>, the
 * derived tier: a condition-mediated finding carries NO rating of its own — the derived tier assigns the
 * pair none, and its detail ends by saying so — yet that detail states each drug-disease rating,
 * "Metformin is rated Major in Acidosis, Lactic". So it is a finding the check judges, and the Major its
 * record states is one it carries: quoted in a sentence citing it, beside an unrated finding or alone, that
 * word is the #554 fourth run's shape and stays silent, while a rating its record does not state is reported.
 *
 * <p>Context-sensitive because that tier is gated on {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.derivedFindings},
 * which ships off (ADR Decision 111); {@link #setUp} turns it on. Everything else is the real pipeline
 * over the shipped knowledge base, as in {@link UnfoundedFindingSeverityTest}.
