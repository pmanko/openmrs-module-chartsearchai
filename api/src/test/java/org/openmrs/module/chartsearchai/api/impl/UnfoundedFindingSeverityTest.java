/**
 * Issue <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/560">#560</a>: an
 * answer attaches a severity to a cited safety finding that carries none. Measured live on Sarah
 * Taylor's chart (a {@code Prednisone Co 5mg} order, recorded allergies to dexamethasone and
 * hydrocortisone): her dexamethasone cross-reactivity finding has no rating and its record says
 * <em>"No severity is rated for this finding."</em>, and answers still called it <em>"a Major
 * finding"</em>. {@code unstatedFindingSeverities} asks the opposite question and says nothing about a
 * record with no rating, by construction.
 *
 * <p>The cases run the real {@link LlmInferenceService#search}/{@code searchStreaming} orchestration
 * over a chart the real {@link PatientChartSerializer} rendered and the real
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator} &rarr; {@code injectRecords} chain injected findings into — over the
 * knowledge base the module SHIPS, which is what raises her unrated cross-reactivity findings, except
 * where a case names a hand-authored dataset or a hand-built chart. The model is stubbed, the answer
 * being the one variable this check is about, and so are the seams {@code serviceOver} names: the chart
 * is served already injected, and the post-answer chips are not raised.
 *
 * <p>The findings a case cites are located by what their records SAY — the drug they name, and the
 * rating the injector wrote — never by the stamp the check reads, so a stamp written on the wrong record
 * cannot locate its own evidence.
