/**
 * That the per-pass rule join answers exactly what asking the predicate of every rule answers, for
 * every ordered pair and at every severity floor (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/447">#447</a>).
 *
 * <p>{@link AboveFloorRules} exists to stop both pairwise arms scanning a subject's whole interaction
 * list once per ordered pair, and it does that by asking two indexes which screened entries a rule
 * could name. <b>A narrowing that loses one candidate drops an interaction chip, fail-CLOSED, in a
 * safety net</b> — so what has to be pinned is not the arm's speed but the join's ANSWER, which is
 * why this class exists beside {@code QuestionPairRuleScanPerPassTest} rather than inside it. The
 * chips a screen happens to raise cannot see it: over a dataset where each token names one entry,
 * a too-narrow index and an exact one raise the same chips.
 *
 * <p>The same shape as {@code NameIndexAgreesWithIsNamedTest}, which pins
 * {@link DrugReferenceService#nameIndex()} against {@link DrugReference#isNamed} for issue #339 and
 * for the same reason. This one reaches further in one respect that matters: that guard covers the
 * NAME leg of {@link DrugSafetyValidator#identifies} and nothing in the tree covered the ATC leg,
 * which {@link #theJoinAgreesOverAFixtureCarryingAnAtcOnlyRule} is here for.
 *
 * <p>The oracle is the predicate itself — {@link DrugSafetyValidator#clearsSeverityFloor} and
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#identifies}, composed over the entry's own rule list, which is what the
 * scan the join replaced did — asked of entries the real parsers produced. Not a second reading of
 * what naming means, which is the thing that could drift.

	 * stated and not enforced is one the next caller breaks, so it is read off the source here.

	 * — including the nested {@code AboveFloorRules}, which reaches it as a nestmate — is the one

	 * case spuriously. It fails loudly and says which file, so that is a cost paid in legibility
	 * rather than in silence, which is the trade this repo takes for a rule that would otherwise have
	 * no enforcement at all.
	 *
	 * <p>{@code AboveFloorRules.entriesCodedBy} and {@code atcIndexOf} are held to the same rule, and
	 * for the same reason: both were widened for this class and both say in their javadoc that no
