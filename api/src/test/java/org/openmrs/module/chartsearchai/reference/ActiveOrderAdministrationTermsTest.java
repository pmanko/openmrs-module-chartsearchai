/**
 * Issue #234: whether {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder} carries what the chart records about WHERE
 * an active drug order is applied.
 *
 * <p>The class arm's narrowing is decided by
 * {@code DrugReference.codesForRecordedAdministration} and exercised over knowledge-base slices in
 * {@code UnmappedOrderAdministrationSiteTest}; what it needs and never had is the data. The builder
 * read an order's names and its concept's ATC codes and nothing else, so
 * {@code ActiveDrugOrder} had nothing to narrow on — which is why the ticket calls the route "not
 * available to the module at all".
 *
 * <p><b>Both legs, driven through the real {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder#build(Patient)}</b>,
 * because they come from two different tables and each covers a shape the other cannot. The ROUTE is a
 * column on {@code drug_order}, so it is the only leg a non-coded order can use; the dose FORM is a
 * column on {@code drug}, and it is the only leg that reaches the skin, since the 3.7.1 reference
 * dictionary's 17-member route set names no cutaneous route at all (measured 2026-08-28 against the
 * demo database). A hand-built {@code ActiveDrugOrder} would bypass the whole change, which is the same
 * reason {@code NonCodedDrugOrderNameTest} is context-sensitive.
 *
 * <p>Patient 7's single active drug order (order 111, drug "ASPIRIN", concept 88) is the arrangement,
 * with the two columns set the way the existing context-sensitive cases set theirs.
