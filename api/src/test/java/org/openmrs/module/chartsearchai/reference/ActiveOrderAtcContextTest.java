/**
 * The builder half of issue #132, end to end: an active order's ATC codes must reach the safety layer
 * attributed to THAT order, not only flattened into one context-wide set.
 *
 * <p>Context-sensitive on purpose. {@link ActiveOrderAtcAttributionTest} pins what the validator does
 * with attributed codes, but only the real {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder} — reading real
 * {@code ConceptMap}s off a real order's concept through the real {@code OrderService} — can show that
 * the association exists in production at all. Run through the PUBLIC entry
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate(String, String, Patient)}, so the whole chain executes: the
 * feature gate, the builder's single {@code getActiveOrders} pass, and the screening arm.
 *
 * <p>Patient 7 of the standard test dataset has exactly ONE active drug order (order 111, drug
 * "ASPIRIN", concept 88), which is what makes it the shape the issue describes: a patient on a single
 * medication. Mapping that one concept to the ATC codes of TWO interacting reference entries —
 * Simvastatin {@code C10AA01} × Clarithromycin {@code J01FA09}, a real Major row in the bundled DDInter
 * sample whose rule names its partner by that very code — is the whole arrangement. Before the fix the
 * screen reported those two as an interacting pair, i.e. one order witnessing itself through the ATC
 * leg; the same shape reproduced live on the 3.7.1 standalone (2026-08-05) with a purpose-made
 * "Zolvimix" concept.
 *
 * <p>The order's own name resolving to a third entry (aspirin) is not a problem and is left in rather
 * than engineered away: its order is its own by name, so it contributes no witness either, and a
 * dictionary where the order name happens to be recognised is the realistic case.
