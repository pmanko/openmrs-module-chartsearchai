/**
 * "Is the patient allergic to something they are already taking?" — the contraindication question
 * nothing in {@link DrugSafetyValidator} asked (issue #143).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> Every contraindication arm was keyed on a drug IN PLAY: one the question
 * resolved, or one the answer named. Echo scoping (issue #105) removes an answer-named drug from
 * that set when a record the answer cites already names it — and a drug the patient is PRESCRIBED
 * appears in a {@code drug_order} chart record, which is exactly the record a good answer cites when
 * asked about medications. So an active ibuprofen order plus an ibuprofen allergy, a question naming
 * no drug and an answer citing the real order record raised <b>0 chips</b>, where the identical call
 * with {@code mappings=null} raised <b>2</b>. Measured on {@code sourceFormat=json}, then the default.
 * That 2 is <b>1</b> since issue #146 — it was the curated rule and the identity check reporting one
 * allergy twice, not two findings — which changes none of the reasoning above and every ALLERGY count
 * below (a condition rule cannot fold, so that case is untouched).
 *
 * <p><b>Read with the scoping that came after.</b> The arm this class was written for still exists
 * and every case below still drives it, but it no longer runs on responses that are about something
 * else: a chip is raised where either side of it — the drug or the recorded finding — is part of what
 * the response is about. The case that used to assert the opposite is
 * {@link #aPrescribedAllergyIsNotRaisedWhereTheResponseIsAboutSomethingElse}, which carries the
 * reversal and its reasons; the rule itself and what it gives up are in
 * {@code SubjectMatterScopedContraindicationTest}. Nothing else in the #143 story below is affected,
 * and one part of why is worth knowing before anyone narrows the scoping. Measured by turning the
 * medication widening off and running this class: exactly four cases depend on it —
 * {@link #aConditionContraindicatingAnActiveOrderIsRaisedToo},
 * {@link #everyActiveOrderIsCheckedRatherThanOnlyTheFirst},
 * {@link #theFindingReachesThePromptAsACitableRecord} and
 * {@link #thePatientsOwnContraindicationsLeadTheScreensPairChips}, each of which asks a
 * medication-domain question, so her whole active-order list is subject matter. Those four are the
 * widening's regression net. The other cases do not depend on it, by more than one mechanism — some
 * assert an absence, one is carried by the drug-in-play arm — so do not read them as evidence for any
 * single leg.
 *
 * <p>{@code isEchoOfAttributableRecord} — {@code isEchoOfCitedRecord} when this was written, renamed
 * by issue #360 along with the corpus it reads — justified that residual risk by asserting a
 * proposal-worthy drug is
 * "usually question-named (always validated) or actively ordered (checked directly by the
 * order-driven arms)". The second half was false: counted over the whole class, the order-driven arms
 * ({@code addInteractionWarnings}, {@code addQuestionPairInteractions},
 * {@code addActiveOrderPairInteractions}) read the allergy list ZERO times — they check INTERACTIONS.
 * The contraindication arms read allergies but only ever about the drug in play. Nothing joined the
 * two.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the missing arm rather than a scoping exemption.</b> Exempting contraindications from
 * echo scoping would fix the measured case and nothing beyond it: it still needs the ANSWER to name
 * the drug, so the shape in
 * {@link #aPrescribedAllergyIsNotRaisedWhereTheResponseIsAboutSomethingElse}
 * — a prescribing error nobody happened to write down — stays invisible. It would also widen #105's
 * over-reach onto the contraindication surface, which
 * {@link #aRecitedPartnerThePatientIsNotTakingGainsNoContraindicationCheck} pins against: a drug the
 * answer merely recites out of a cited record is still not contraindication-checked, because the new
 * arm's subject set is the patient's own active orders and nothing else. Adding the arm makes the
 * comment's claim true instead of relaxing the scoping that #105 measured.
 *
 * <p>Every case runs the real pipeline — the real {@code validate} overloads production calls, and,
 * for the prompt half, the real injector wired to the real validator — with no mock and no
 * reimplementation anywhere. Two details vary by case, deliberately:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The cases that need echo scoping to be ACTIVE pass real querystore-shaped chart records and
 *       the mappings overload, because scoping is what those cases are about; the three that do not
 *       ({@link #aConditionContraindicatingAnActiveOrderIsRaisedToo},
 *       {@link #everyActiveOrderIsCheckedRatherThanOnlyTheFirst},
 *       {@link #thePatientsOwnContraindicationsLeadTheScreensPairChips}) pass {@code null} mappings,
 *       the documented no-scoping shape, so nothing about them depends on it.</li>
 *   <li>All but one run on the real bundled curated dataset (the production default
 *       {@code sourceFormat=json}, whose ibuprofen entry carries both a curated allergy rule and an
 *       identity-resolvable name).
 *       {@link #aRecitedPartnerThePatientIsNotTakingGainsNoContraindicationCheck} needs the bundled
 *       DDInter sample instead: the partner its answer recites has to be an ENTRY in the loaded
 *       dataset, or no scoping carve-out could have chipped it and the case would assert nothing.
 *       The curated four carry no lisinopril.</li>
 * </ul>
