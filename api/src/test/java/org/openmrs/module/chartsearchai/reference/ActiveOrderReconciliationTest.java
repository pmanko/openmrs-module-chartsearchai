/**
 * Reconciliation between the drug-safety layer's active-order read and the serialized chart
 * (issue #118), exercised through the real {@link DrugReferenceInjector#injectRecords} seam over
 * the real bundled dataset.
 *
 * <p>The defect: the safety layer reads active orders straight from {@code OrderService} while the
 * answer is grounded only in the serialized querystore chart, and nothing compared the two. When
 * they disagreed the clinician got both — a chip naming "active order simvastatin" beside an
 * answer stating "No active medications are recorded." (observed on the 3.7.1 standalone, HEAD
 * {@code 13690b1}), with nothing logged. The trigger there was querystore index drift, which is
 * querystore's defect to fix; what belongs here is that the divergence was silent and degraded
 * into a contradiction instead of into a missing record.
 *
 * <p>The chip is deliberately NOT suppressed when the chart disagrees: it comes from the
 * authoritative service read and was right in every observed case, so silencing it would trade a
 * visible contradiction for a missing safety warning. These tests therefore only assert what the
 * chart gains.
