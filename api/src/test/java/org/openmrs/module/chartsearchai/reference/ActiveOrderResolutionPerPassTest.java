/**
 * The patient's active orders are resolved ONCE per injection pass, not once by the injector and
 * again by the {@code validate} it calls (issue #255).
 *
 * <p>{@code DrugReferenceInjector.injectRecords} resolves
 * {@code DrugReferenceService.findForActiveOrders} for its own promotion predicate, for
 * {@code matchingEntries}' candidate set (issue #151) and for the reference names it attaches — and
 * then calls {@code preAnswerFindings}, whose {@code validate} resolved the very same list again.
 * A second derivation of a value the pass already holds, which is the shape
 * {@code CLAUDE.md} prescribes removing rather than caching: "wherever a caller already holds the
 * resolved list, pass it down rather than resolving again".
 *
 * <p><b>What these cases count, and why that is the honest unit.</b> A timing assertion would be
 * flaky and machine-shaped. The repeat's cost is a whole resolution — walks of the loaded dataset for
 * every order name the chart carries — and the number of them is a deterministic integer, independent
 * of the dataset's size and of how fast the box is. So the count is taken through a subclass that
 * increments and delegates to {@code super.findForActiveOrders}: the real service, the real parser,
 * the real injector and the real validator behind it. An instrument, not a mock — nothing of the
 * pipeline is re-expressed.
 *
 * <p><b>The count alone cannot see a wrong list</b>, which is why
 * {@link #theInjectedFindingsAreThoseTheSelfResolvingPassProduces} is here and drives the composed
 * entry point rather than the seam. An injector threading a plausible-but-wrong list — the keys of
 * {@code matchingEntries}, say, or any other list it already holds — still resolves exactly once for
 * itself, so it satisfies the count while changing what the prompt is told. That case is what fails
 * on it.
