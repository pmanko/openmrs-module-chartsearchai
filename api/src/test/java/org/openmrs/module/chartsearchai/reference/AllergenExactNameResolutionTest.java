/**
 * An allergy resolves to the entry that IS the recorded drug, not to the earliest entry that merely
 * claims its name (issue #176).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> {@link DrugReferenceService#lookupByToken} returned the EARLIEST entry any of
 * whose names matched, and reference names nest, so the row a chart's allergen resolved to could be a
 * different presentation of the substance — or a different substance. Since issue #187 that row is what
 * every one of the three chips this arm can raise NAMES, so the misresolution is printed: the chip
 * reports an allergy to a drug the chart does not record.
 *
 * <p><b>Not the boundary problem #128/#148 fixed.</b> {@code botulinum toxin type a} is a whole-word
 * match — indeed the whole string — inside the {@code Daxibotulinumtoxina} row's alias list, because
 * that row's {@code rxnorm_name} IS that name. Anchoring cannot separate them. What separates them is
 * that one row's own DISPLAY NAME is the recorded name and the other's is not.
 *
 * <p>This used to add "and neither can {@link DrugReference#canonicalRow}: both rows name no route, so
 * the fold keeps the earliest, which is the wrong one". Issue #250 made that false of this family — the
 * fold's second rung prefers the row whose display name IS the name the data files the family under,
 * which here is {@code Botulinum toxin type A} — so the fold now reaches the same row by a route of its
 * own. What is unchanged is that the RESOLUTION rank is what the chip reads: mutate
 * {@link DrugReference#nameMatchStrength} to drop its display-name rank and
 * {@code anAllergyIsNamedByTheRowThatIsItRatherThanByAnEarlierRowThatClaimsItsName} reddens with the
 * chip reading {@code Daxibotulinumtoxina (botulinum toxin type a)}, so this file still pins what it was
 * written to pin. The case whose premise #250 genuinely removed is on the ORDER side —
 * {@code OrderedSubjectRowTest}, where the trap moved to the COVID pair in this same fixture.
 *
 * <p>Every case runs over verbatim shipped-KB slices through the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}
 * parser, and the cases that assert an OUTCOME go through the real
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate(String, String, PatientClinicalContext)} and assert the chip text,
 * so none can pass by raising some other chip about the right substance. The
 * {@code theFixtureReallyCarries…} cases are their premises: each states, through the production
 * predicates, what makes the outcome case next to it discriminating, so that case cannot rot into a test
 * of nothing.
