/**
 * Resolving an ALLERGEN — a clinician-entered drug name — to a reference entry (issue #147).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> The same string reached two matchers with different tolerance depending on
 * which half of the safety check was asking. An interaction rule's token was matched against an
 * active order's display name by {@link DrugReference#matchesOrderName}, which tolerates the one
 * inflectional ending a localized drug name adds; an ALLERGEN was resolved to its entry by
 * {@link DrugReference#matchesText}, the symmetric prose rule. So a patient prescribed
 * {@code Clarithromycine Co 500mg} and recorded as allergic to {@code Clarithromycine} was told
 * that simvastatin "interacts with active order clarithromycin — Major", while their own recorded
 * allergy to that same drug produced nothing at all: the module knew both facts and reported only
 * the one whose matcher happened to be tolerant.
 *
 * <p>An allergen string is a third shape, and it was never assigned a matcher — it inherited the
 * prose one. It is not prose: like an order's display name it is one localized, inflected drug name
 * read out of the dictionary in the current locale (or typed free-hand), which is why the fix gives
 * it {@link DrugReference#matchesDrugName} rather than loosening {@code matchesText}. Loosening that
 * is what issue #86 measured as wrong for prose ("advil" must not match inside a longer word), and
 * the last case here pins that prose matching did not move.
 *
 * <p><b>Both directions, measured 2026-08-05</b> over the 3.7.1 demo dictionary's 1219 allergen-
 * candidate names (locale-preferred and fully-specified names of the {@code Drug}, {@code MedSet}
 * and {@code Pharmacologic Drug Class} classes, the three allergen concept sets, and the
 * {@code Allergy to …} concepts) against the full 19MB KB's 2283 entries: the prose matcher resolved
 * 549 of those names, the drug-name matcher resolves <b>624 — 75 newly resolved, 0 lost</b>. These are
 * counts of WHETHER a name resolves, which is {@code matchesDrugName}'s question and is untouched by
 * issue #176; the count of names resolving to a different constituent of a multi-drug product, which
 * that issue does move, stood here and is removed rather than restated unmeasured. The whole
 * #86/#128/#129 kill set was
 * re-scored in the allergen direction as well: 0 of 21 nesting pairs resolve to the nested drug.
 *
 * <p>Every case runs the real pipeline: a verbatim KB slice through the real
 * {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}, then the real
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate(String, String, PatientClinicalContext)}, with GP reads on
 * their no-context defaults (severity floor {@code minor}).
