/**
 * WHAT an ATC level-4 subgroup's own published NAME licenses — issues #183 and #184, decided
 * together by one criterion because they are one question asked twice.
 *
 * <p><b>The criterion.</b> A subgroup may justify a claim only as strong as what its name asserts,
 * and a residue asserts whatever the group it sits in asserts (issue #182's rule, applied here at
 * every level rather than one):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a name that states a CHEMICAL or structural family, a derivative class, or a molecular
 *       TARGET says what its members are, and licenses both claim types;</li>
 *   <li>a name that states only what its members are FOR — an indication, an organism acted
 *       against, a therapeutic area, a diagnostic use — licenses DUPLICATE THERAPY, which is a
 *       claim about purpose, and not CROSS-REACTIVITY, which is a claim about chemistry
 *       ({@link DrugReference#isPurposeOnlyAtcCode}, issue #183);</li>
 *   <li>a name that asserts nothing at any level — a residue whose ancestry is residue up to a bare
 *       LEVEL-1 anatomical main group, a body system — licenses NEITHER
 *       ({@link DrugReference#isUnclassifyingAtcCode}, issue #184). Level 2 is ATC's therapeutic
 *       tier and does assert a purpose, so a residue inheriting one falls under the bullet above.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Why the split is by ARM and not by one list.</b> The owner's standing hypothesis was that
 * ATC classifies purpose and route rather than chemistry, so it should license duplicate therapy
 * only and cross-reactivity should come from the curated groups alone. Measured over the shipped
 * 19 MB KB by driving this class's own {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate} entry point over each of
 * the 5550 substance pairs the knowledge base relates by a level-4 subgroup: that blanket rule
 * removes all 5266 cross-reactivity claims, of which 3701 rest on a subgroup that does name chemistry
 * or a molecular target — the penicillins, the cephalosporins, the aminoglycosides, the
 * benzodiazepines, the statins — against 1565 that rest on purpose or on nothing, and the one curated
 * group the module ships replaces just 24 of the 5266. Lost real signal exceeds the false-claim
 * reduction 2.4 to 1, so the blanket rule is not what shipped; this narrower reading removes the 1565
 * and keeps the 3701. Re-measure before relying on a figure.
 *
 * <p>Asserted through the real {@code validate} entry point on both arms, over rows copied
 * field-for-field from the shipped KB. Every case here pins a LIMB OF THE CRITERION rather than a
 * list entry: each has a partner case whose only difference is what ATC's name says.
