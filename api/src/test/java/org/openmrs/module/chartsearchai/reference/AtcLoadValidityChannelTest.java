/**
 * Issue #266, first half: {@code sourceFormat=atc} had no validity channel at all, so
 * {@code findings} on {@code GET /chartsearchai/drugreferencestatus} was empty for that format
 * whatever its file did.
 *
 * <p>Two structural causes, and neither is a rule that failed to fire — there was nothing for a rule
 * to fire INTO. {@link AtcDrugReferenceSource} resolved its own file rather than through
 * {@link ReferenceDataFiles}, so no {@link DrugReferenceValidity} collector existed; and it inherited
 * {@link DrugReferenceSource#lastLoadFindings()}'s empty default, so nothing collected could have
 * reached {@link DrugReferenceService#getLoadStatus()}. That is the strongest form of the rule
 * {@code CLAUDE.md} states — silence is the ABSENCE of a finding, never a muted one, and every
 * finding reaches both the log and {@code toMap()}.
 *
 * <p>Consequence the ticket names first: issue #156's <em>"the file you configured was not read"</em>
 * was unreachable on the ONE format with no bundled fallback — the format most dependent on the
 * operator's own file was the one whose file-not-read condition was invisible.
 *
 * <p>Every case here drives the real load — {@link DrugReferenceService#getLoadStatus()} over the
 * real global properties, with a real file in the application data directory — so what is asserted is
 * what an operator polling the endpoint would read, not what a parser returns to a test.
