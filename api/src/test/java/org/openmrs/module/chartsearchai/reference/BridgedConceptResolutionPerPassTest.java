/**
 * The bridged-concept leg is resolved at most ONCE per {@code validate} pass, and not at all by a pass
 * no arm of which asks for it (issue #353).
 *
 * <p>Both halves are cost properties with no other guard, and each fails silently. {@code resolvesFrom}
 * runs once per (row, order) pair inside two nested loops, so a leg resolved per CALL would put a
 * ranked dataset resolution inside that product — the shape issue #256 removed from the class arm, and
 * nothing about it would go red. And every consumer of the leg sits inside an interaction arm, so a
 * pass whose toggles are off or whose question and answer resolve no drug must not pay for it at all;
 * an eager hoist into {@code validate} is a one-line change that likewise reddens nothing.
 *
 * <p>Counted on {@code DrugReferenceService.findByBridgedConcept} itself rather than on
 * {@code getAll()}, which the pass calls for many other reasons: this is a statement about how often
 * the LEG is resolved, and the two are different questions. The candidate set is resolved OUTSIDE the
 * measured window and handed to {@code validate}, which is what production does
 * ({@code DrugReferenceInjector} passes its own resolution down, issue #255) — so what these count is
 * the pass's own cost and not {@code findForActiveOrders}'.
