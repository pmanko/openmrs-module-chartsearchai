/**
 * The two sites where issue #353's bridged-concept leg SILENCES rather than adds, one case each
 * (review round 3).
 *
 * <p>{@code DrugSafetyValidator.activeOrdersOtherThan} and {@code DrugSafetyValidator.ordersOtherThan}
 * both withhold the subject's own prescriptions — from witnessing the subject's interactions, and from
 * being named as its partner's source. ADR Decision 68 rests the whole "the leg must be RANKED"
 * argument on those two, because everywhere else an over-wide answer only misses a pair while here it
 * removes a warning or misattributes one, with no chip difference and no log line. Round 2 measured
 * that neutering the bridged argument at either method ALONE left the whole api suite green and said
 * so rather than closing it. These are the owed cases.
 *
 * <p><b>They are two methods with two parameters, and the plausible slip is dropping the leg from one
 * of them</b>, so one case per method: substitute {@code BridgedOrders.NONE} for the argument at
 * {@code activeOrdersOtherThan}'s own {@code resolvesFromAny} and the first case reddens; do it at
 * {@code ordersOtherThan}'s and the second does.
 *
 * <p><b>Context-sensitive because the arrangement needs a lowered severity floor</b>, which is a
 * global property. It needs one for a structural reason and not a convenient one: the shape both cases
 * turn on is one prescription whose bridged concept resolves TWO substances that the knowledge base
 * relates to each other, and DDInter rates every real fixed-dose combination's constituents against
 * each other {@code Unknown} — below the shipped {@code minor} floor. {@code Abacavir / lamivudine}
 * (CIEL 103166) is that shape in {@code ddi-combination-allergen.json}, verbatim from the shipped
 * dataset, and the rating is the dataset's own.
