/**
 * Build-time guard on the ONE resolution of "which row does this response call this substance by"
 * (issue #236), in two needles. {@code interactionSubject} is called from
 * {@code SubstanceSubjects.subjectOf}, from its own two-arity overload, and from
 * {@code addPartnersForUnmappedOrders} — and from nowhere else in {@code DrugSafetyValidator}. And
 * {@code SubstanceSubjects} is CONSTRUCTED once, inside {@code validate}, so that the arms reading it
 * are reading one instance rather than one class.
 *
 * <p><b>What it forbids and why.</b> Five arms of that class name a chip's subject. Issue #206 gave
 * three of them one memoised per-{@code validate} lookup and left the two pairwise arms folding their
 * own narrower row group through {@code canonicalSubjects}; issue #236 deleted that method and pointed
 * the last two at the same lookup. The rule that survives the deletion is a rule about CALLERS —
 * {@code interactionSubject}'s own javadoc states it ("a chip arm looks its subject up through
 * {@code SubstanceSubjects} rather than calling this directly … calling this directly is how an arm ends
 * up folding a narrower row group than its siblings, which is exactly what #206 was") — and until this
 * class existed nothing enforced it. A sixth arm resolving its own subject would reintroduce the split,
 * and the whole complaint of issue #236 is that its safety rested on nothing stated.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the second needle, and why it is not a belt on the first's braces.</b> The caller rule is a
 * rule about {@code interactionSubject}, and the cheapest way to reintroduce #236's defect makes no call
 * to it: re-construct {@code SubstanceSubjects} over the arm's own row group and read {@code subjectOf}
 * off that. That is semantically the deleted {@code canonicalSubjects}, it is now the most natural edit
 * available because this change introduced the class it reuses, and the caller scan is green through it —
 * measured by writing exactly that line into {@code addActiveOrderPairInteractions} and again into
 * {@code addQuestionPairInteractions}. So the two needles forbid different things: one arm may not fold
 * its own group, and no arm may hold its own lookup. Locating the single construction inside
 * {@code validate} is what closes the variant a count alone would not — a per-arm helper returning a
 * fresh instance is one {@code new} in the file and one object per caller.
 *
 * <p><b>Why structural and not behavioural.</b> A second resolution is only OBSERVABLE where the two row
 * groups differ, which needs a substance whose rows publish different alias sets. Measured over the
 * shipped 19 MB KB by driving {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource.parse}, {@code DrugReference.matchesText}
 * and {@code DrugReference.substanceGroupKey}: of its 129 multi-row substances, 22 publish a name that
 * resolves a strict non-empty SUBSET of the family. Putting that subset and the whole family to
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.interactionSubject} then elects two different rows on 10 of the 22 —
 * <b>and that figure is a property of the SECOND operand, which has to be stated with it</b>: 10 with
 * {@code Collections.emptyList()} as the recorded names, 0 where the patient's own record names the
 * subset-resolving name, and 22 — every one of them — where it names one of the family's other rows.
 * So the divergence is rare in the KB and ordinary on a chart that names the drug, which is why the
 * shared group carries the ORDER rows too.
 * {@code OrderedSubjectRowTest.theQuestionPairChipNamesTheSubstanceTheOtherArmsName} poses it on a
 * hand-authored fixture, which is also what the chart lever needs — see there.
 * So a new arm resolving separately would agree with its siblings on almost every input and redden
 * nothing. That is the same argument {@code OrderPartnerNameSourceWritePathTest} makes for its own scan,
 * and {@code ArchitectureGuardTest} is this repo's other source-scanning guard.
 *
 * <p><b>The permitted callers, and why each is permitted rather than merely present.</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code SubstanceSubjects.subjectOf} — the shared lookup itself. This is the one that must
 *       remain the whole of how a CHIP names a substance.</li>
 *   <li>{@code interactionSubject(List, PatientClinicalContext)} — the two-arity overload, which does
 *       nothing but add {@code recordedDrugNames} and delegate. One method, two arities, never a second
 *       definition; its own javadoc says so.</li>
 *   <li>{@code addPartnersForUnmappedOrders} — the class arm's PARTNER-naming rung (issue #228), a
 *       different question from a chip's SUBJECT and licensed by the same javadoc's "#228 the class
 *       arm's PARTNER too" paragraph. {@code CLAUDE.md} routes partner naming through
 *       {@code partnerLabel}/{@code reconciledPartnerName}, not through this lookup.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>What it does NOT cover, stated so the guard is not credited with more than it has.</b> It reads
 * ONE file, and what that costs differs between the two needles rather than being one residue.
 * {@code interactionSubject} is package-private and static, so a new chip arm written in another class
 * of {@code …chartsearchai.reference} could call it and the caller scan would not see it — unlike the
 * write-path precedent, whose two fields are private members of a private nested class, so the compiler
 * covers every other file. That residue is deliberate: the five arms all live in
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator}, a sixth outside it would be a larger design change than a slip, and the
 * blessed cross-class caller ({@code DrugReferenceInjector.chartAnchoredSubject}, which raises no chip)
 * shows the package boundary is not the rule's edge. The CONSTRUCTION needle has no such residue while
 * the class stays as declared: {@code SubstanceSubjects} is a {@code private static final} nested class,
 * so no other file can name it and the compiler makes the one-file scan complete for that needle — which
 * is why {@link #LOOKUP_DECLARATION} asserts the modifiers and not just the name, so that widening them
 * reddens here rather than silently enlarging what is unscanned.
 *
 * <p>Neither needle says anything about an arm that resolves a subject some OTHER way — by calling
 * {@code DrugReference.canonicalRow} directly, say, or by writing a second lookup class of its own —
 * which is a different needle and a different rule; what bounds that residue is that such an arm still
 * has to fold the group somehow, and the two folds this class knows of are {@code interactionSubject}
 * (scanned, in every syntactic form the name can take — see {@link #CALL}) and {@code canonicalRow}
 * (not).
 *
 * <p>And both needles read the source as TEXT, so an indirection that keeps the text unchanged is
 * outside them. The one measured on this PR: a lambda declared inside {@code validate} that closes over
 * a construction and is applied per arm keeps this file at one literal {@code new SubstanceSubjects(}
 * inside {@code validate}'s body, and passes both. It is named rather than closed because closing it is
 * a dataflow question and this is a text scan; what catches it is the behavioural case
 * ({@code OrderedSubjectRowTest.theQuestionPairChipNamesTheSubstanceTheOtherArmsName}), and that case
 * covers the question-pair arm only — so on the screening arm this residue is uncovered, which is the
 * honest bound on what these two needles buy. Both needles are statements about the source as WRITTEN:
 * rename any of the three permitted methods, the lookup class or {@code validate}'s widest arity, and
 * this fails loudly rather than quietly forbidding nothing, which is the safe direction.
 *
 * <p><b>Why neither test can pass vacuously.</b> For the caller scan: every permitted body is located
 * and asserted before anything is compared, the declaration count is asserted, and the number of calls
 * FOUND is asserted. For the construction scan: the class declaration and {@code validate}'s body are
 * both located through {@link #uniqueOffsetOf}, which fails on absent and on ambiguous alike, and the
 * count of constructions is asserted to be one rather than at most one — a needle matching nothing
 * therefore fails instead of forbidding nothing. Either way a rename, a truncated read or a
 * brace-matching failure fails this class rather than silently enforcing nothing.
