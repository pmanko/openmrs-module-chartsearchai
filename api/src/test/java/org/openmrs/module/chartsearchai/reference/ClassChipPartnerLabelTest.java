/**
 * What a class chip calls the ACTIVE ORDER it names — issue #155 (a raw ATC code where a drug name
 * belongs) and issue #174's site 1 (the label chosen by dataset order).
 *
 * <p><b>Issue #155.</b> {@code displayLabelForAtcCode} returned the code itself when the loaded
 * dataset carried no entry for it, so on {@code sourceFormat=json} — the bundled four-entry curated
 * seed, which carries no aspirin entry at all — Agnes Adams' chip read
 * {@code … as active order N02BA01}, and {@code N02BA01} is not a drug name. That was the DEFAULT when
 * #155 was filed, so it was reachable out of the box; since ADR Decision 36 the default knowledge base
 * does carry aspirin, which narrows the shape to a dataset that cannot name a code it was handed rather
 * than removing it.
 * The order itself carries a display name, and the chip is built from that order.
 *
 * <p><b>Issue #174 site 1.</b> {@code entryForAtcCode} returned the FIRST entry carrying the code
 * while every row of a substance publishes identical codes, so the label was whichever row the
 * dataset listed first. {@code Cyclosporine (ophthalmic)} precedes {@code Cyclosporine} in the
 * shipped KB and both publish {@code L04AD01}, so a systemic cyclosporine order was named as an
 * ophthalmic preparation.
 *
 * <p>Both are the same resolution: name the order by the substance the dataset knows, else by the
 * order's own display name, else — and only then — by the code. Driven through the real
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate}: the first case over the real bundled curated dataset (the
 * production default), the second over rows the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource} parses out of a
 * verbatim KB slice.
