/**
 * The patient's co-medications are resolved ONCE per {@code validate} pass, however many drugs the
 * question puts in play (issue #256).
 *
 * <p>{@code DrugSafetyValidator.classRelationships} runs per in-play substance and used to call
 * {@code orderPartners(context)} each time — a resolution of the whole active-order list that is a
 * function of the pass's context alone, so every call after the first re-derived an answer the pass
 * already had. The cost is NOT the pairwise arms the issue names: measured through the real
 * {@code validate} over the shipped knowledge base, it grows as drugs-in-play TIMES active orders
 * rather than as pairs, and on a 43-order chart a probe attributed 77% of a ten-drug pass to that one
 * method, while ALL the work a chart-less pass does — the drug-in-play arms and the pairwise ones
 * together — came to 30 ms of that 490, which is the upper bound on the arms the issue blamed.
 *
 * <p><b>What these cases count, and why that is the honest unit.</b> A timing assertion would be flaky
 * and machine-shaped. The repeat's own cost is full walks of the loaded dataset — what
 * {@code orderPartners}' javadoc calls "the repeated full scans" — and a walk begins with a call to
 * {@code DrugReferenceService.getAll()}, which is a deterministic integer count: independent of how
 * big the dataset is and of how fast the box is. So the behavioural cases run on the small DDInter
 * excerpt and count that call, through a subclass that increments and delegates to
 * {@code super.getAll()}: the real service, the real parser, the real {@code validate}. An instrument,
 * not a mock — nothing of the pipeline is re-expressed.
 *
 * <p>What is counted is therefore CALLS and not walks, and the two are not the same: {@code validate}
 * takes the list once for its own use without walking it. That inflates the absolute numbers and
 * cannot reach the invariant below, which is a DIFFERENCE between two passes over the same question —
 * every call a pass makes regardless of the chart appears on both sides and cancels.
 *
 * <p><b>The invariant is stated as a DIFFERENCE, so that no tally is published and none can go
 * stale.</b> The same question is validated twice, once against a chart carrying active orders and
 * once against a chart carrying none; the sweeps attributable to the ORDERS are the difference, and
 * that difference must be the same for every number of drugs in play. Against the excerpt it is flat
 * with the resolution held for the pass and rises by roughly one resolution per drug without it, so
 * the case reddens at TWO drugs in play rather than only at five.
 *
 * <p><b>Two guards against a vacuous pass</b>, because {@code 0 == 0} would satisfy the invariant while
 * testing nothing: the orders must cost at least one sweep at all, and the five-drug question must
 * raise strictly more chips than the one-drug question — otherwise the extra drugs are not reaching
 * the arm that resolves co-medications. A fixture edit breaking either would make the invariant
 * unfalsifiable rather than merely wrong.
 *
 * <p><b>Why there is a source scan beside the behavioural cases.</b> Two things the counting cases
 * cannot see. A memo held in a FIELD and reassigned once per pass passes them flat, which is exactly
 * the limit CLAUDE.md records for the analogous {@code recordedAllergens} memo — so the single
 * construction site is asserted structurally instead, together with the class's whole FIELD BUDGET:
 * one mutable field, the injected service. That second half is asked of the compiled CLASS rather
 * than of the source, because successive reviewers in turn defeated the regex that asked it of the text —
 * see {@link #theBeanHoldsNoStateButTheInjectedService}. And a NEW per-subject caller of
 * {@code orderPartners}, or of the uncached {@code sweepForAtcCode}, in an arm these fixtures
 * do not exercise would reintroduce the defect invisibly: {@code ruleAbout} was the second such caller
 * and this arrangement never reaches it, since that method returns before resolving anything when the
 * subject has no rule about an active order, which is the ordinary outcome. The mechanism mirrors
 * {@code ChipSubjectOneResolutionTest}'s and {@code OrderPartnerNameSourceWritePathTest}'s, and this
 * being the THIRD class to need the walk is what extracted it into {@link SourceScan} — the threshold
 * {@code ModuleSourceRoot}'s own javadoc records for itself. Those two are deliberately not migrated:
 * they are outside this change, and the second of them keeps its file locator apart from
 * {@code ModuleSourceRoot} for a reason its own javadoc states.

	 * <p>The mechanism prose is deliberately not pinned: it is the dataset's, another case's business,
	 * and it is not what sharing one partner list across two subjects could disturb. What could is
	 * exactly what is here — which partner each subject is chipped about, what that partner is called,
	 * how the pair is rated, and the order the chips arrive in. Captured from the pre-change code and
	 * unchanged by the change (verified by diffing the full rendered chip list, all five questions and
	 * every detail in full, across the two heads).
	 *
	 * <p><b>Two things have moved since, and issue #256's invariant is neither of them.</b> Issue #339
	 * made an unfolded rule chip ask the same reconciliation a folded one asks, so a co-medication is
	 * named as the dataset names it rather than by the knowledge base's own match token —
	 * {@code warfarin} became {@code Warfarin}, and so on for all ten. Issue #346 then made the
	 * drug-in-play arm append its rule chips strongest first rather than in the knowledge base's row
	 * order, which is what re-grouped each subject's chips into a Major, then Moderate, then Minor run.
	 *
	 * <p>What this list is FOR survives both, and the second one is worth spelling out because it
	 * touches the property that reads as most at risk. Arrival order is still pinned, because the sort
	 * is stable and separates chips only where the findings differ in strength: WITHIN each run the
	 * chips arrive in the dataset's own order — Clarithromycin's three Majors as Warfarin, Digoxin,
	 * Amiodarone and its four Moderates as Metformin, Sertraline, Tramadol, Ciprofloxacin — so sharing
	 * one partner list across two subjects still cannot disturb which partner a subject is chipped
	 * about, what that partner is called, the rating, or where it sits among the chips it ties with,
	 * without failing here. The trailing question-pair chip stays last because that is a different
	 * arm. A rename that made these lower-case again would fail

	 * only where {@link #RESOLVER_BODIES} permits, and every mention outside them is a finding whatever

	 * {@code orderPartners}, {@code soleSubstanceOf} and {@code CoMedications.entryForCode}, where the

	 * overload resolution, not a new mention: measured in review at both sites, it reinstated a full

	 * does not compile, and a call
	 * written to the sweep's own name from any of them is a mention outside its permitted bodies.
	 * Mutate {@code entryForCode} to call {@code sweepForAtcCode(upperCode)} and read which case fails,
	 * rather than trusting this paragraph.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The residue, and why the chase stops here rather than at "there is none".</b> This reads
	 * SOURCE TEXT with string literals blanked — deliberately, so that a method named in a javadoc is
	 * prose and not a call — so a name reached AS a literal is outside it by construction. Demonstrated:
	 * {@code getClass().getDeclaredMethod("sweepForAtcCode", String.class)} with {@code setAccessible},
	 * from inside {@code ruleAbout}, reinstates the full dataset walk per (subject, partner, code) with
	 * the whole suite green. It is left uncovered on a judgement worth stating, and every earlier
	 * evasion of this guard family WAS closed: those shapes — a memo field typed as something other
	 * than {@code CoMedications}, a parenthesised initialiser, an annotation prefix, a method
	 * reference, a dropped overload argument — are ways ordinary code gets WRITTEN, and a regression can
	 * be made of them by accident. Writing reflection
	 * into a private call inside the same class is not an accident, and no textual guard can close that

	/**
	 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator} holds ONE piece of mutable state, and it is the service Spring
	 * injects — issue #172's rule stated as the bean's whole field budget, since a pass memo kept on a
	 * singleton is one unsynchronized structure shared by every concurrent request and, having no key,
	 * answers for whoever asked first.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Asked of the compiled CLASS and not of the source text, which is the point of it.</b> This
	 * began as a regex over {@code DrugSafetyValidator.java} and successive reviewers defeated it in
	 * turn, each fix opening the next and every one of them green across the whole suite: a memo
	 * typed as something other than {@code CoMedications}; then the same field given a parenthesised
	 * INITIALISER, which met an exclusion written for method declarations; then a declaration prefixed
	 * with {@code @SuppressWarnings("…")}, whose own paren the match-start could not cross. Each of
	 * those is a way of WRITING a field, and a reader of text can always be written around.
	 * {@code getDeclaredFields} sees the field however it is spelled, so the arms race ends here rather
	 * than continuing one needle at a time.
	 *
	 * <p><b>{@code static final} is not an exemption, because {@code final} binds the REFERENCE and not
	 * the contents.</b> {@code private static final Map<…> CACHE = new LinkedHashMap<…>()} is the most
	 * idiomatic way a Java author writes a memo, and it is issue #172's trap in its worst form —
	 * unsynchronized, shared by every concurrent request, and keyed on a per-request object so it grows
	 * for the life of the JVM. A modifier check alone exempted it: added to this class with
	 * {@code CoMedications.resolved()} reading and populating it, the whole api suite stayed green, and
	 * the behavioural cases here cannot see it either since the memo still resolves once per pass. So a
	 * {@code static final} field is collected too where it HOLDS a container — {@link #holdsAContainer}
	 * asks the declared type and, failing that, the value, so a field declared as {@code Object} is
	 * caught as well. What that leaves permitted is the class's constants, which are immutable values:
	 * a {@code Logger}, {@code Pattern}s and {@code int}s today.
	 *
	 * <p>What it still cannot see is state held in ANOTHER class — a static holder, a
	 * {@code ThreadLocal} — and that is left uncovered on evidence rather than by oversight: both
	 * shapes were tried and both fail the suite catastrophically, because Surefire runs one JVM and the
	 * leak reaches unrelated test classes. The residue on THIS class is a mutable object that is
	 * neither a container nor declared as one — a static holder instance of a bespoke type, say — which
	 * no type-shaped rule reaches; it is named rather than claimed away.
