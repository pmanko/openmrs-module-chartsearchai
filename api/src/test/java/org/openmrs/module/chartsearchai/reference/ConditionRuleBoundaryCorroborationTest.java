/**
 * Issue #309 — a CONDITION rule matched by bare containment, stated as this patient's chart's own
 * reading with nothing corroborating it.
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> {@code DrugSafetyValidator.corroboratedByTheChart} answered {@code true}
 * unconditionally for every rule that is not a self-named ALLERGY rule, so a condition rule reached
 * {@code Recorded for this patient:} on the strength of {@code PatientClinicalContext.hasConditionToken}
 * alone — which is bare containment, deliberately, because a curated condition token is MEANT to match
 * a fragment ({@code penicillin} inside {@code benzylpenicillin} on the allergy list beside it; the
 * example that stood here, {@code peptic ulcer} inside "history of peptic ulcer disease", was
 * deleted on 2026-09-03 because {@link DrugReference#containsWord} ACCEPTS it and it therefore
 * argues for nothing). That is issue #269's
 * defect one rule type along: for a patient whose recorded condition is {@code Status Post Cesarean
 * Delivery}, an entry ruling on the condition token {@code liver} read
 * <pre>
 * Recorded for this patient: acute hepatitis or liver failure
 * </pre>
 * and said it of a chart that records a caesarean delivery.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the fix is a boundary witness and not the allergy union.</b> The ticket says the
 * corroboration test has no condition analogue, because both of its legs resolve a drug NAME and no arm
 * resolves a recorded condition to a reference substance. That is right about the legs and wrong about
 * the conclusion: what redeems a condition match is not a resolution but a BOUNDARY — whether some
 * matched record carries the token as a whole word rather than inside a longer one.
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.aMatchedConditionCarriesTheToken} is that question, and it reuses
 * {@link DrugReference#containsWord}, the PROSE rule, because that is the shape
 * {@code PatientClinicalContext.containsToken}'s own javadoc describes the condition haystack by ("a
 * condition in the clinician's own wording"). No matching behaviour moves: {@code hasConditionToken} is
 * byte-identical, and no chip's detail, rank or severity moves — the {@code SafetyWarning}'s
 * own {@code uncorroboratedChartMatch} flag does flip for a condition rule, which is what the injected
 * finding reads, and since issue #374 what the chip publishes as
 * {@code restsOnAnUncorroboratedChartMatch} too.
 *
 * <p><b>What the measurement decided</b> (issue #309, over the OpenMRS 3.7.1 reference-application demo
 * dictionary; the figures and both corpora are recorded on
 * {@link PatientClinicalContext#containsToken}). The hazard is real and its false matches are clinical:
 * a rule on {@code liver} matches a condition recorded as {@code Status Post Cesarean Delivery}, and the
 * counts are on {@code containsToken} rather than here. The LOSS is zero over the two CODED corpora,
 * and the base that zero is over is ONE token: {@code peptic ulcer} accounts for every match on
 * either corpus (5 of the candidate values, 1 of the recorded ones, none mid-word — overlapping
 * corpora, so the two are never summed) and the seed's other three condition tokens match
 * nothing in either corpus, so the familiar "all four tokens" wording is vacuous for three of them —
 * which is the proxy issue #223 used for the allergy side, run for conditions, with the same
 * weakness. That bound is
 * load-bearing: the free-text half is unmeasured and is where the rule DOES cost, on the seed's own
 * tokens ({@link #anInflectionOfAShippedTokenIsHedged}). What is pinned here is the token set the
 * claim is about ({@link #theShippedSeedPublishesExactlyTheFourConditionTokensTheMeasurementWasOver});
 * {@link #aShippedSeedConditionTokenIsStillStatedAsRecorded} is one worked case of it, not a guard
 * over the corpus, which this repo does not carry and which still escapes.
 *
 * <p><b>Prompt-facing as issue #309 shipped it</b>, exactly as issues #269 and #308 scoped themselves:
 * this is {@code corroboratedByTheChart}, which both injected channels ask. The chip's own demotion
 * ({@code contraindicationRank}, issue #223) is allergy-typed and stays so.
 *
 * <p><b>Which was the LIMIT of #309 and not only its scope.</b> On the very arrangement
 * {@link #aConditionTokenNestingInsideARecordedConditionIsNotStatedAsTheChartsOwnReading} drives, the
 * clinician-facing chip said "Naltrexone is contraindicated by an active condition: acute
 * hepatitis or liver failure", unqualified, of a chart recording a caesarean delivery — the model
 * read a hedge and the clinician did not. Issue #374 publishes the chip's own answer, which
 * {@link #theChipCarriesTheSameProvenanceAnswerTheRecordDoes} pins here; the SENTENCE is still the
 * categorical one, so wherever a comment here says the chip survives, that is reassurance for the
 * cases this rule OVER-hedges and remains the false claim on the hazard case. ADR Decisions 73 and
 * 92; tightening the match is NOT the remedy (fail-open).
 *
 * <p><b>The residue, deliberately given up.</b> A prefix or suffix compound that is clinically the same
 * finding is hedged: {@code Lymphedema} and {@code Angioedema} for a rule on {@code edema}, pinned by
 * {@link #aClinicallyRightCompoundIsHedgedToo} so the cost is a case rather than a sentence.
