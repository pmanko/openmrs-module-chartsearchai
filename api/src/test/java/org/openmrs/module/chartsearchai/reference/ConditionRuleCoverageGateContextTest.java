/**
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.conditionRuleCoverage()} is NOT gated on the {@code drugSafety}
 * toggles, and this is the case that holds that rule (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/378">#378</a>).
 *
 * <p><b>It exists because the rule was written down with a false reason behind it.</b> The javadoc
 * and ADR Decision 75 first argued that gating the accessor on
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.reportsContraindications()} would make
 * {@link DrugReferenceLoad.Coverage#UNLOADED} unreachable on the {@code /search} surface. It would
 * not: that gate reads {@code drugSafety.validateAnswers} and {@code warnOnContraindications},
 * which default TRUE, while whether the dataset loads at all is decided by
 * {@code drugReference.enabled}, which defaults FALSE — so on a stock install the gate is open and
 * the answer is {@code UNLOADED} with or without it. Two review agents each implemented the
 * rejected gate and watched the whole suite stay green. A rule whose only support is a paragraph,
 * and a refutable one, is a rule the next session removes for free.
 *
 * <p>So the rule is pinned by an arrangement that actually separates the two designs: <b>the arms
 * switched OFF over a dataset that DID load</b>. A gated accessor states {@code null} there; this
 * one states what the dataset publishes. It is the case where the statement is most worth having —
 * an operator who turned the contraindication arms off has certainly not screened anyone's
 * conditions. It is not the only separating arrangement, and an earlier draft of this sentence
 * claimed it was: the designs also differ with the arms off and the feature off, where a gate states
 * {@code null} and this states {@code UNLOADED}. Both are cases below and both redden under the
 * rejected gate — which the sentence that used to sit here got wrong twice over, calling the second
 * uncased and treating it as untouched by the gate.
