/**
 * One substance, one contraindication chip — however many rows the reference data files it as
 * (issue #145).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> Both contraindication arms are keyed on a subject ENTRY, and DDInter files
 * one substance as several route/formulation rows. One clinician-facing string resolves all of them
 * ({@code findByQuery} and {@code findByDrugName} return every entry whose aliases match), so one
 * clinical fact became one chip per row. Worse than duplication: only the row
 * {@link DrugReferenceService#lookupByToken} resolves the allergy to matched by IDENTITY, so its
 * siblings fell through to the class comparison and the patient was told a substance is
 * cross-reactive with their allergy to <em>itself</em> — measured live on the 3.7.1 standalone, a
 * dexamethasone allergy asked about dexamethasone gave 1 identity chip plus 3
 * "Dexamethasone (nasal/ophthalmic/topical) is in the same ATC class (A01AC) as the patient's allergy
 * to Dexamethasone" chips. Since issue #110 every chip is also injected as a citable pre-answer
 * record, so each duplicate reached the prompt too.
 *
 * <p><b>What the grouping key has to get right</b>, and why {@code rxnorm_name} equality alone is not
 * it. The reference data's own substance name (equivalently its {@code rxcui} — measured over the
 * shipped 19 MB KB, the two partition the 2283 entries identically: 142 families, 332 entries) is
 * what the route variants share, but it is also shared by pairs of genuinely DIFFERENT substances:
 * {@code Omeprazole}/{@code Esomeprazole} (both {@code rxnorm_name=esomeprazole},
 * {@code rxcui=283742}, both {@code A02BC05}), {@code Amphetamine}/{@code Dextroamphetamine},
 * {@code Fenfluramine}/{@code Dexfenfluramine}, {@code Gabapentin}/{@code Gabapentin enacarbil},
 * {@code Netupitant}/{@code Fosnetupitant}, {@code Ketoconazole}/{@code Levoketoconazole},
 * {@code Fenofibrate}/{@code Fenofibric acid}, {@code Atropine}/{@code Hyoscyamine} — every one of
 * them the {@code enalapril}/{@code enalaprilat} shape issue #121 decided must stay two chips. So the
 * key is the substance name AND the display-name stem (the name with trailing parenthesized
 * qualifiers removed): see {@link DrugReference#substanceKey()}, which records the measurement for
 * both halves.
 *
 * <p>Both directions are asserted here — and so is the ordering the collapse cannot assume, a group
 * whose allergen row is not its first — against slices taken verbatim from the shipped KB, through
 * the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource} parser and the real {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate}
 * entry points.

		// right call for a re-spelling of one rule and a lossy one for two genuinely different notes
		// under one token; the latter is authoring pathology no shipped dataset contains, and is
		// reported rather than designed around here.
