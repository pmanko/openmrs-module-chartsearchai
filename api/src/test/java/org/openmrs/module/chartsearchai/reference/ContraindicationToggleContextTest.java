/**
 * {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.warnOnContraindications} silences the active-order contraindication
 * arm (issue #143) exactly as it silences the drug-in-play ones — they share the one flag
 * {@code validate} resolves per call.
 *
 * <p>Context-sensitive because the point IS the global property: the case writes a real GP through the
 * admin service and reads it back through the real {@code validate} path, so the assertion cannot pass
 * on the hardcoded default. Every contextless case in {@link ActiveOrderContraindicationTest} runs with
 * the GP absent, which fails safe to {@code true} — so none of them can distinguish an arm that honours
 * the operator's switch from one that ignores it (mutation-verified: calling the arm unconditionally
 * left all 889 tests green before this case existed).
 *
 * <p>What the switch means matters here more than for the arms it already gated. Those fire only for a
 * drug the question or the answer names, so an operator who turns them off is declining an answer-scoped
 * annotation. This arm takes its SUBJECTS from the chart rather than from any wording — it can chip
 * about a prescription nothing in the response names individually — and a chip it raises can also be
 * injected into the prompt as a citable finding (issue #110), so an arm that ignored the flag would keep
 * writing contraindications into the context window of a deployment that had switched contraindication
 * reporting off, and the answer could assert one with no chip beside it. Both directions are asserted,
 * because a 0-chip assertion under a disabled flag proves nothing unless the same arrangement provably
 * chips when it is enabled.
 *
 * <p>"Can", not "every": that used to be every, and the subject-matter scoping made it a subset. The
 * prompt is built from a pass over the QUESTION alone, so a chip this arm raises because the ANSWER or
 * a cited record put the drug in subject matter has no finding in the prompt behind it — measured in
 * {@code SubjectMatterScopedContraindicationTest
 * .theQuestionAloneCanLeaveThePreAnswerPassWithNothingToPromote}, which is that arrangement exactly.
 * The toggle argument is unaffected, since it only needs the two channels to share this flag.
 *
 * <p><b>The question in the fixture below is load-bearing and reads as if it were incidental.</b> This
 * class used to say the arm "fires on EVERY question", which was true when it was written and is not
 * since {@code DrugSafetyValidator.SubjectMatter} bounded the arm to what the response is about. What
 * keeps the enabled case chipping is that "What are her current medications?" is a medication-domain
 * question, so her whole active-order list is subject matter; swap it for a cue-free one and the
 * enabled assertion goes red for a reason that has nothing to do with the toggle.
