/**
 * The diacritic fold on the ALLERGY and CONDITION token haystacks — {@code
 * PatientClinicalContext.containsToken}, behind {@code hasAllergyToken}/{@code hasConditionToken}
 * (issue #141).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> This is the one matcher issues #129/#138 did not reach: that work folded
 * {@link DrugReference#containsBoundedToken}, the ORDER-NAME scan, and deliberately scoped itself
 * there. The allergy/condition haystack kept raw {@link String#contains}, so on the SHIPPED DEFAULT
 * source format ({@code sourceFormat=json}) the curated Amoxicillin entry's
 * {@code {"type":"allergy","token":"penicillin"}} rule missed an allergen recorded as
 * {@code Pénicilline G} — a real fr locale-preferred name in this dictionary, reached by default in a
 * francophone deployment because {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder} reads the concept name in the
 * CURRENT locale. Unlike most defects found this week this one needs no {@code ddinter} configuration
 * to reach.
 *
 * <p><b>Measured 2026-08-05</b> over the 3.7.1 demo dictionary's 1219 allergen-candidate names (237
 * of them accented) against the shipped curated dataset's six allergy tokens: raw containment matched
 * 27, folded containment matches 38 — <b>11 names gained, 0 lost</b>, over the tokens
 * {@code penicillin} (6 names) and {@code paracetamol} (5). {@code ibuprofen}, {@code amoxicillin},
 * {@code nsaid} and {@code aminoglycoside} are unaffected: no accent falls inside those stems. The
 * condition arm gained 0 over the dictionary's 9472 diagnosis/finding names, because none of the four
 * curated condition tokens has an accent anywhere in its stem either — which is why the condition case
 * below is driven from a fixture whose tokens are the accented side, the direction a francophone
 * deployment's own curated file takes.
 *
 * <p>Folding alone suffices, and that is the whole change: bare containment already tolerates the
 * trailing {@code -e}/{@code -s} of {@code Pénicillines}, so no boundary or inflection rule is added
 * here. The last case pins that, because it is what separates this relaxation from the boundary rule
 * the order-name arm needs — a token deliberately matches a FRAGMENT of allergy/condition free text
 * ({@code penicillin} inside {@code benzylpenicillin}, which both boundary rules refuse; issue #223
 * measured that loss), and a boundary rule would silently stop matching the rules that exist.
 * The two examples that stood here until 2026-09-03 do not carry that argument and were deleted
 * rather than reworded: {@code peptic ulcer} inside "history of peptic ulcer disease" is accepted by
 * {@link DrugReference#containsWord} AND by {@link DrugReference#matchesOrderName}, and
 * {@code nsaid} inside "NSAIDs" is accepted by {@code matchesOrderName} — the very rule named here —
 * its two-letter tail allowance covering the plural. The cases below still assert what they always
 * asserted; only the reason given for them moved.
 *
 * <p>Every case runs the real pipeline: the real
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate(String, String, PatientClinicalContext)} over the real curated
 * dataset (the bundled curated file, which an unset {@code sourceFormat} GP selected until ADR Decision
 * 36 moved the default to {@code ddinter}; these cases pin it explicitly through the shared accessor) or
 * over a fixture parsed by the real {@link JsonDrugReferenceSource}.
