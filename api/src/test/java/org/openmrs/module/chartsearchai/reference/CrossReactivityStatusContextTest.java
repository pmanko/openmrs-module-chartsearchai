/**
 * Issue #266, second half: the curated cross-reactivity groups load raised findings that reached
 * ONLY the log.
 *
 * <p>{@link CrossReactivityGroupsLoader} already went through {@link ReferenceDataFiles}, so issue
 * #156's {@code configured-data-file-not-read} really fired for that file — and then went into
 * {@code logTo} and stopped there, because nothing retained it. Its own javadoc called that "a gap
 * rather than a design". {@code CLAUDE.md}'s rule is that every finding reaches BOTH channels: the
 * WARN at the moment it happens and {@code toMap()} afterwards, which is the only one that can answer
 * after a lazy load (issue #154). A groups document declaring no {@code groups} table was worse still —
 * it parsed empty with no rule firing at all, which is issue #242's shape on a third dataset.
 *
 * <p>Every case drives the real load through
 * {@link DrugReferenceService#getCrossReactivityLoadStatus()} over the real global property, with a
 * real file in the application data directory.
 *
 * <p><b>A section of its own, not a row in the entry load's {@code findings}.</b> The two datasets have
 * independent lazy loads, independent global properties and independent origins, so one flat list could
 * not tell an operator which file a finding describes — see ADR Decision 48.
