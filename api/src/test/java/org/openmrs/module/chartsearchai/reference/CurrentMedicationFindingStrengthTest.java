/**
 * A finding about a medication the patient is ALREADY TAKING states a call about that medication,
 * never a call about giving a drug (issue #348).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> Asked a screening question — one that names no drug and proposes nothing —
 * the answer came back as a prescribing refusal about a drug the patient is on: <em>"No — Salicylic
 * acid should not be given: it interacts with active order Methotrexate, a Major problem [61]."</em>
 * The finding and the severity were right; nobody asked whether to give salicylic acid. What made it
 * one was the clause the record carried: {@code STRENGTH_WITHHOLD} names an ACT — withholding — that
 * presupposes a proposal, and {@code LlmProvider.DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT} turns that literal into
 * "open with \"No\" and what to avoid". The two ORDER-DRIVEN arms have no proposal to withhold, so
 * they state the counterpart call instead: the strength is unchanged and only the act moves, which is
 * what the issue asked for.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the counterpart is a clause and not words beside one.</b> ADR Decision 44 measured an
 * ADDITIVE clause on this very record type, six runs, and the answer was byte-identical: a clause
 * nothing in the prompt keys on is inert, and its own reasoning says why ("The clause introduces no
 * new call for {@code DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT} to teach"). What moved the call, 3 of 3 with the chip
 * byte-identical, was changing the clause the prompt DOES key on (ADR Decision 37). So this replaces
 * the strength clause for these findings rather than qualifying it, and the prompt teaches both new
 * classes in the record's own words — {@code SafetyVerdictSeverityGradationTest} owns that half.
 *
 * <p><b>Both order-driven arms, because the condition is one condition.</b> The interaction SCREEN
 * (issue #113) and the allergy-and-condition join against the patient's own prescriptions (issue
 * #143) are the two arms ADR Decision 37 groups as "the arms whose subject is a drug the patient is
 * already on", and they CO-OCCUR on the very question shape this issue reports:
 * {@code QueryScopeRouter.isInteractionScreening} requires the MEDICATIONS intent, which is the same
 * classification {@code SubjectMatter} widens the order-driven contraindication arm by. Fixing one
 * would leave the other holding the phrase the prompt's ranking sentence keys on, so the refusal lead
 * would simply move to it — {@link #everyFindingOnAScreeningQuestionStatesOneVocabulary} is that
 * arrangement, and it is why the scope is the condition rather than the reported arm.
 *
 * <p><b>How the order-driven contraindication arm's referent is guarded.</b>
 * {@code addActiveOrderContraindications} decides the referent once per row and passes it at FOUR
 * call sites — the subject-matter branch and the fall-through, each handing it to
 * {@code addContraindications} and to {@code addAllergyContraindications} — and the two that hand it
 * to {@code addAllergyContraindications} reach THREE chip rungs inside it (identity, same ATC class,
 * same cross-reactivity group). Each site and each rung needs its own case, exactly as CLAUDE.md
 * states for the sibling parameter on this same arm ({@code chartOrderBridges} "takes its list as a
 * parameter, so each call site needs its own case"). Force one site to one constant, or invert one
 * rung, and read which case reddens. No tally of covered cells is recorded here, and no claim that
 * the set of them is complete: round 4 published this coverage per PAIR and round 5 per SITE and per
 * RUNG, and each was falsified by the next round at the granularity its predecessor had just
 * introduced — round 6 refuting round 5's rung enumeration and its unreachability claim in turn.
 *
 * <p><b>The reading that was published and then refuted, kept because its failure is the
 * instructive part.</b> Round 5 recorded the FALSE direction at each of the two
 * {@code addAllergyContraindications} sites as unreachable in effect: that direction needs a SIBLING
 * row to have put the substance in play, the drug-in-play arm has then already raised, for the
 * in-play row, a chip with the same ledger key, the same rank, the same {@code namesTheFinding}
 * answer and the same sentence, and {@code ContraindicationChips.add} keeps the incumbent on a tie —
 * so the order-driven chip is discarded. The premise it leaves unchecked is the INCUMBENT, and that
 * premise holds at ONE rung and not at the other two. Identity is a function of the SUBSTANCE, so
 * the in-play row answers it the same way and the tie argument is right there. The two CLASS rungs
 * read the ROW's own ATC codes, so the in-play row raises a chip at them only where ITS codes relate
 * it to the recorded allergen; give the two rows different subgroups and the in-play row relates to
 * nothing, so the ledger holds no chip for the substance when the order-driven row arrives and there
 * is no tie for that rule to decide. Round 5 measured it on a fixture whose rows shared their codes,
 * where its argument does hold, and wrote the conclusion unscoped.
 *
 * <p>Its claim about the SHIPPED knowledge base stands and is kept, scoped to that data:
 * {@code ContraindicationChips}' javadoc carries the measurement with its date and the instruction
 * to re-measure it on a refresh, and anticipates this same arrangement for its own replacement
 * branch. What reaches the cells is an OPERATOR dataset — the reference file is configurable through
 * {@code chartsearchai.drugReference.dataFilePath}, {@code JsonDrugReferenceSource}'s schema
 * expresses per-entry {@code atcCodes} beside a shared {@code substanceName}, and
 * {@code DrugReferenceValidity} carries no rule against two rows of one substance publishing
 * different codes.
 * {@link #anAllergenArmSiblingRowOfAProposedSubstanceStatesTheProposalCall} and
 * {@link #anAllergenArmSiblingRowReachedByTheFallThroughStatesTheProposalCall} hold those two cells
 * over such a dataset, one per site, and
 * {@link #aCrossReactivityGroupFindingAboutHerOwnPrescriptionStatesTheCurrentMedicationCall} holds
 * the third rung, which round 5 enumerated but left unheld in this direction.
 *
 * <p><b>What a rung mutation cannot see, which is where to look next.</b>
 * {@code addAllergyContraindications} is called by the drug-in-play arm too, at a site that passes
 * the referent as a literal {@code false}, so a rung's failures may come from either caller and a
 * rung reddening in both directions does not establish that the ORDER-DRIVEN arm reaches it in
 * both — at the identity rung it does not, for the structural reason above. Nor does either matrix
 * distinguish a
 * (site, rung) PAIR: forcing a site reaches every rung raised from it and forcing a rung reaches
 * both sites, so a change making one rung read the referent only when reached from one site would
 * leave both matrices reddening exactly as they do now. There is no per-pair expression to mutate
 * today; if one is written, that is the granularity to mutate at, because each of these rounds found
 * the recurrence one level below where its predecessor had looked.

	/**
	 * The allergen arm's FALSE referent direction, at the arm's subject-matter call site (issue #348,

	 *
	 * <p><b>What round 5 got wrong, kept here because its failure is the instructive part.</b> Round 5
	 * recorded this cell and its fall-through twin as unreachable in effect, reasoning that the
	 * FALSE direction needs a SIBLING row to have put the substance in play, that the drug-in-play
	 * arm has then already raised a chip for the in-play row with the same ledger key and the same
	 * rank, and that {@code ContraindicationChips.add} keeps the incumbent on a tie. The premise it
	 * did not check is the incumbent, and it holds at ONE of the three rungs rather than at all
	 * three. Identity is a function of the SUBSTANCE, so the in-play row does answer that rung the
	 * same way and round 5's tie argument is right there. The two CLASS rungs read the ROW's own ATC
	 * codes — {@code refClasses} from {@code ref.atcSubgroups()}, {@code refGroups} from
	 * {@code CrossReactivityGroup.groupsOf(ref)}, itself a pure function of those codes — so the
	 * in-play row raises a chip at them only where ITS codes relate it to the recorded allergen.
	 * Give the two rows different subgroups and the in-play row relates to nothing, so the ledger
	 * holds no chip for the substance when the order-driven row arrives and there is no tie for the
	 * incumbent rule to decide. Round 5's measurement was made on a fixture whose rows shared their
	 * codes, where its argument does hold.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Which data reaches it.</b> Not the shipped knowledge base — that half of round 5's claim
	 * stands, round 6 re-measured it at this head, and the figure lives with its date where it was
	 * first recorded, in {@code ContraindicationChips}' javadoc, which also anticipates this very
	 * arrangement ("a group whose rows publish DIFFERENT ATC codes") for its own replacement branch.
	 * An operator dataset reaches it: the file is configurable
	 * through {@code chartsearchai.drugReference.dataFilePath}, {@code JsonDrugReferenceSource}'s
	 * schema expresses per-entry {@code atcCodes} beside a shared {@code substanceName}, and
	 * {@code DrugReferenceValidity} carries no rule against two rows of one substance publishing
	 * different codes. So the cell is reachable on data an operator can configure today, and the
	 * fail-open direction it guards is the one this issue reports with its sign flipped — a drug the
	 * clinician just proposed described as therapy to change.
	 *
	 * <p>The question both names the drug and asks about medications, which is what opens
	 * {@code SubjectMatter}'s active-order gate and routes the row to the arm's FIRST call-site pair.
