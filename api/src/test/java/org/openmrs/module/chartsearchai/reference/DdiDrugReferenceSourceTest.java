/**
 * Exercises the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource} and its behaviour through the real injector
 * and validator (via {@link DrugReferenceTestSupport}). With no OpenMRS context available the
 * source falls back to the bundled {@code /chartsearchai/ddi-knowledge-base.json} — the production
 * default, and since ADR Decision 36 the whole 2283-substance knowledge base rather than the 16-drug
 * excerpt it used to be — so these run the real load/parse/inject/validate paths against the data a
 * default install actually reasons over.
 *
 * <p>The tests that need a slice the knowledge base does not contain, or a bounded one whose partner
 * lists they can state, feed the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource#parse} a fixture instead (through
 * the shared {@link DrugReferenceTestSupport#ddiFixtureEntries}, or
 * {@link DrugReferenceTestSupport#ddinterEntries()} for the excerpt); the pipeline exercised is the
 * same, only the dataset is narrowed.
 *
 * <p>Not only parser behaviour: six of these cases specify {@link DrugSafetyValidator}'s
 * one-chip-per-(drug, active order) collapse of issue #115, because the shape that motivates it —
 * several route variants of one drug publishing the same match token — only exists in a DDInter
 * dataset. The shapes only a hand-authored dataset can pose live in
 * {@link InteractionPartnerGroupingTest}. Between them they are the collapse's specification, so a
 * change to it should run both.

	 * The collapse's own half of the chip order, over partners the arm's ordering cannot separate.
	 *
	 * <p>Issue #346 made this arm append its findings strongest first, which took the collapse's
	 * positional guard away from
	 * {@link #theMostSevereChipLeadsEvenWhereItsGroupsWinnerWasDecidedLast} — that case's iron is Major
	 * and its dexamethasone Minor, so the sort now decides their order on its own and a re-inserted
	 * winner is invisible to it. This case restores the guard, on the same slice under a different
	 * SUBJECT.
	 *
	 * <p>Sirolimus and Sirolimus (protein-bound) are one substance, so this arm rules over both rows.
	 * The plain row opens lapatinib's group at Moderate, then phenytoin's at Major, then voxelotor's at
	 * Moderate; the protein-bound row afterwards raises lapatinib and voxelotor to Major, and leaves
	 * phenytoin's group alone — Major ties Major, and the route step keeps the unqualified row. So all
	 * three partners end Major, nothing about severity can separate them, and their order is
	 * {@code bestRulePerPartner}'s grouping alone. Phenytoin is the reference point precisely because
	 * it is the one group NOT replaced: a LinkedHashMap keeps a re-put key where it was and leaves
	 * lapatinib ahead of it, while a HashMap or a remove-then-put moves lapatinib behind it.
