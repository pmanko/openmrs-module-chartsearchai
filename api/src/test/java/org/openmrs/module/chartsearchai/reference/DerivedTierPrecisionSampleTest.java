/**
 * The derived tier's precision figure (issue #480, ADR Decision 111) was measured over ONE knowledge
 * base, and is only true of it. This fails the build when the shipped knowledge base stops being that
 * one, so a refresh re-opens the measurement instead of silently leaving a stale figure in the decision.
 *
 * <p>Every weight the figure rests on is re-derived here from the knowledge base rather than read from
 * the sample file (issue #485): the chains the real loader keeps
 * ({@link DrugReferenceTestSupport#shippedEntries()}), each joined back to the one raw
 * {@code derived_interactions} row it was read from, because the loader does not keep the
 * {@code cause_note_id} a LINK is keyed on. The join is on everything a
 * {@link DrugReference.ConditionMediatedRisk} carries plus the rated entry, and is itself checked —
 * each kept chain must match exactly one raw row. It filters no raw row on severity: which rows count
 * is decided by what the loader kept, so its {@code Major} gate is not restated. What it does have to
 * know of the loader is where an entry's id comes from (a drug row's own id or its rxcui); a drug row two
 * entries carrying its name could be is reported rather than guessed, and one no entry carries joins
 * nothing, so a chain the loader kept through it is reported as unjoined.
 *
 * <p>Over that enumeration it checks:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the POPULATION — its kept chains, its links and its (link, rated substance) pairs, and that the
 * census and the sample partition it as the sample file says;</li>
 * <li>each adjudicated LINK's own weights — its kept chains and the distinct rated substances among
 * them ({@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()}), carried by every item and by no control, each item
 * filed in the {@code census} or the {@code sample} stratum and no control in either, and for a control
 * that its link is still kept;</li>
 * <li>each adjudicated LINK's CAUSE drugs — the names of the cause entries its kept chains are read
 * through ({@link DrugReference.ConditionMediatedRisk#getCause()}), as a set, against the {@code causeDrugs}
 * its note was judged for, items and controls alike, so a chain re-pointed to a drug the note does not
 * discuss is reported even where every count holds;</li>
 * <li>the CENSUS — still the heaviest links, by the rule the sample file records;</li>
 * <li>the TEXT each verdict was given on — the SHA-256 of every adjudicated note, read from the raw
 * {@code disease_notes} table, which the module does not load. A rewritten note leaves every count
 * unchanged, which is why this is here;</li>
 * <li>the WHOLE POPULATION — one line per link in the census rule's order, its note id, condition, kept
 * chains, distinct rated substances and the sorted names of its cause drugs, against the SHA-256 the sample
 * file records (issues #496, #500), so a move of chains that changes those for a link no item adjudicates
 * is reported where every count above still holds. A run that ranks the links writes the lines it hashes
 * to {@code api/}{@value #RANKED_LINKS} and hashes that file, so a refresh that reddens it leaves the
 * ranking and weights to re-measure from;</li>
 * <li>the SAMPLE — its items are the links outside the census at the draw's positions the sample file
 * records.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Not checked: that those positions are what the recorded {@code random.Random(480)} draw returns (Python's
 * generator is not re-derived here); which rated substances a link's chains are read through where its
 * counts hold; and, for a link no item adjudicates, anything its line does not carry, such as which of two
 * cause entries sharing a name a chain is read through.
 *
 * <p>It re-derives no verdict: those are data, recorded in
 * {@code api/src/test/resources/eval/derived-tier-precision-sample.json}, and nothing here judges a note.
