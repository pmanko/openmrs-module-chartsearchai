/**
 * The DIRECT allergy check — "they are allergic to this drug, do not give it" — for a reference
 * entry that carries no classification data at all (issue #135).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> The allergen arm of the validator resolved each recorded allergy to a
 * reference entry and asked three questions in decreasing specificity: is the allergen THIS drug,
 * does it share this drug's ATC level-4 subgroup, does it share a curated
 * {@link CrossReactivityGroup}. Only the last two need classification data, but the whole loop sat
 * behind one early return that skipped it when the drug being checked had neither a subgroup nor a
 * group — so the identity question, which is a comparison of two object references and needs no
 * ATC code at all, was never asked for such an entry.
 *
 * <p><b>How wide that is.</b> Measured over the full openmrs-ddi-knowledge-base DDInter 2.0 dataset
 * (2283 drugs, 295184 interaction rows) on 2026-08-05: <b>444 entries (19.4%) carry no ATC codes at
 * all</b>, and 0 carry ATC codes without a level-4 subgroup — so the guard's two halves fail
 * together, on nearly a fifth of the dataset. A curated cross-reactivity group cannot rescue any of
 * them either, and not merely because that file is small: group membership is defined by ATC PREFIX
 * ({@link CrossReactivityGroup#containsCode}), so an entry with no ATC code can never belong to one
 * however much curated data a deployment authors. Nor can the curated-rule arm
 * ({@code addContraindications}): {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}'s entries expose {@code
 * interactions}, never {@code ageBands} or {@code contraindications} — its own documented V1 scope,
 * and the parser sets neither field. For those 444 drugs the
 * direct-allergy warning had no path to the clinician at all — no chip, and (since issue #110, which
 * turns every chip into a citable pre-answer record) nothing in the prompt either.
 *
 * <p><b>The fixture</b> is a verbatim excerpt of that dataset — {@code Ledipasvir} and {@code
 * Leucovorin}, two of the 444, plus {@code Ciprofloxacin} and {@code Levofloxacin} as a real
 * classified pair — parsed by the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}. The DDInter excerpt cannot host
 * these cases: all 16 of its drugs carry ATC codes, which is why no existing test covered a direct
 * allergy to an unclassified drug.
 *
 * <p>That pair shares <em>two</em> level-4 subgroups, not one — {@code J01MA} (J01MA02/J01MA12,
 * fluoroquinolone antibacterials) and {@code S01AE} (S01AE03/S01AE05, ophthalmic
 * fluoroquinolones) — because DDInter files both substances under several ATC codes. Since issue
 * #161 {@code sharedClass} prefers the subgroup that classifies the substance over one that
 * classifies a locally applied formulation, so {@code J01MA} is chosen over the ophthalmic
 * {@code S01AE} whichever order the arrays are in, and the case below asserting {@code (J01MA)} no
 * longer pins the dataset's code order. Both halves of what this paragraph used to say were
 * falsified by that change and have been removed rather than renumbered.
 *
 * <p>The curated cross-reactivity groups are loaded in every case here, deliberately: the identity
 * chip has to appear for an entry the real curated data genuinely cannot classify, not merely for
 * one whose groups a test pinned empty.
