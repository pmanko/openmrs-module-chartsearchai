/**
 * Issue #260 — the dose arm located a substance's name in the answer with {@link String#indexOf}, so it
 * disagreed with the module's own rule for what prose NAMES about the very clause it had just gated on.
 *
 * <p><b>Where the two rules meet.</b> {@code DrugSafetyValidator.attributedDoses} gates each clause on
 * {@link DrugReference#matchesText} — the PROSE rule, symmetric word boundaries and a diacritic fold,
 * which CLAUDE.md's matching bullet makes the rule for a question, an answer or a rendered record. It then
 * asks WHERE that name sits relative to the {@code N mg}, because a dose belongs to the drug named nearest
 * it and any OTHER substance's name sitting strictly closer takes it away. The gate used the module's rule
 * and the locator used raw substring search, and they answer differently in both directions:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a name the prose rule does NOT find is found by {@code indexOf} — {@code penicillin} inside the
 *       plural {@code penicillins} — so an entry the clause does not name can veto a real dose;</li>
 *   <li>a name the prose rule DOES find is not found by {@code indexOf} — {@code paracetamol} written
 *       {@code paracétamol} — so a substance the clause names cannot locate itself and its own dose is
 *       never attributed to it.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Both are the SILENT direction: no chip, no log line, nothing separating "within the ceiling" from "never
 * compared against it". That is the direction {@code DoseCeilingBySubstanceTest} was written for one layer
 * over, and the reason this is a defect rather than a rough edge.
 *
 * <p><b>What the issue predicted and what the construction found.</b> Issue #260 predicted the symptom as
 * a nested name CLAIMING another substance's dose, with {@code estrone} inside {@code estrone sulfate} as
 * the example. That example is not this defect: {@code estrone} is a whole word inside {@code estrone
 * sulfate}, so the prose rule finds it exactly where {@code indexOf} does and the boundary rule changes
 * nothing about it. The blocking direction above is the one the raw locator actually produces, and it is
 * what these cases pin. The nested-name shape is real for a different reason and was issue #270, closed
 * by settling a distance tie on containment; {@code NestedNameDoseTieTest} covers it.
 *
 * <p><b>And one case here is not about the boundary at all.</b>
 * {@link #aSubstanceNamedTwiceInOneClauseIsLocatedByItsNearestMention} pins the scan over an alias's
 * LATER occurrences — the thing the shared rule's {@code from} parameter exists for. It is here because
 * that parameter arrived with this fix, and because a mutation run during hardening found the scan pinned
 * by nothing: stopping at the first occurrence left the whole api suite green.
 *
 * <p><b>Hand-authored fixture, and the reason is the RIVAL and nothing else.</b> The shipped curated seed
 * would carry the three cases that name no rival — the control, the accented subject and the named-twice
 * pair — because it publishes Paracetamol with the same 4000 mg/day adult ceiling, and
 * {@code DoseCeilingAttributionTest.noShippedConfigurationCanReachTheAttributionAtAll} shows the dose arm
 * running on it. What the seed cannot pose is a SECOND substance whose published name a
 * clinical answer would naturally write in a form that nests it: its twelve aliases are
 * {@code ibuprofen/brufen/nurofen/advil}, {@code paracetamol/acetaminophen/panadol/tylenol/calpol},
 * {@code amoxicillin/amoxil} and {@code gentamicin}, and no answer writes "ibuprofens" or "gentamicins"
 * the way it writes "penicillins". (An earlier version of this paragraph said the fixture was needed
 * because no bundled dataset carries both {@code ageBands} and {@code substanceName}. That is not a
 * requirement — {@code substanceGroupKey} falls back to the row itself, so a seed entry is already its own
 * substance. {@code substanceName} is set here only so the cases run the substance-keyed path a
 * {@code ddinter} deployment would.)
 *
 * <p>Every case runs the REAL production path: the fixture parsed by the real
 * {@link JsonDrugReferenceSource}, the real {@code validate} entry point, real question and answer strings.
