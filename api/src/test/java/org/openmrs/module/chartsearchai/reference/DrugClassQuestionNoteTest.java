/**
 * A question that names a drug CLASS rather than a substance — issue #354.
 *
 * <p>Question-driven resolution is substance-name matching end to end, so {@code an oral
 * contraceptive} and {@code an NSAID} resolve to nothing: no reference record is injected, no arm
 * has a subject, and the module falls SILENT — indistinguishable, to a reader of the prompt, from a
 * question that is not about drugs at all. The answer then states that the records do not address
 * the question, while the knowledge base holds a rated pair against the patient's own order for
 * every member of the class.
 *
 * <p>What this pins is that the module stops being silent and says what it did not do. It does NOT
 * pin a resolved class — the issue names that as one of two outcomes and this change takes the
 * other, for the reason recorded on {@link DrugReferenceService#namedDrugClass}: the ATC hierarchy
 * does not express these classes, and no membership list this module could author would be sound.
 *
 * <p>So every case here asserts the deterministic half — the record the injector appends. Whether
 * an ANSWER relays it is the model's, and nothing in this module can assert it. That is also why the
 * record is not the only channel: the class is published on the response itself as
 * {@code unresolvedDrugClass}, read off this same note — {@code
 * LlmInferenceServiceUnresolvedDrugClassTest} and {@code ChartSearchAiUnresolvedDrugClassTest} pin
 * that half.

	 * present — and a substring guard is defeated by rewording rather than by deleting anything:
	 * measured, appending a reworded version of the first two refuted sentences leaves all of them
	 * green. This is citable reference prose an answer may reproduce, so any change to it has to be
	 * SEEN. Spelled out rather than composed from {@link DrugReferenceInjector#REFERENCE_PREFIX},
	 * which would compare a constant to itself.
	 *
	 * <p>A failure here is not by itself a defect — it means the record's words changed. Read the
	 * four refuted sentences recorded on {@code DrugReferenceInjector.renderDrugClassNote} before
	 * updating this literal, because they are what a fifth wider sentence would have to survive.
