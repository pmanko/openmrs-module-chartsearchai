/**
 * A drug in play that is one of the patient's OWN active orders states the current-medication call,
 * not the proposal call — issue #402, ADR Decision 123.
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> Asked <em>"Is it safe to add prednisone for her?"</em> about a patient holding
 * an active {@code Prednisone Co 5mg} order, the answer opened <em>"No — Prednisone should not be
 * added"</em>. The drug-in-play arm stated the proposal referent for every drug the question or the
 * answer put in play, so nothing in the finding told the model the drug was already hers. The arm now
 * states the current-medication referent where the drug's substance is one her active orders establish
 * she takes, and it does so at every site the arm builds a finding at: one referent per drug in play, so
 * the prompt's ranking sentence cannot hand the lead to a finding stating the other one.
 *
 * <p><b>One case per site.</b> Each site takes the referent as its own argument, so a case per site is
 * what a mutation of one of them back to {@code false} can redden — the reason CLAUDE.md gives for the
 * sibling {@code chartOrderBridges} parameter. Mutate a site and read the failures; no mapping of site
 * to case is published here. The derived tier's site is held in {@code ConditionMediatedFindingTest},
 * which switches that tier on, and the several-orders finding's in {@code SubstanceInSeveralActiveOrdersTest}.
 *
 * <p>Each case drives the real {@code injectRecords} with the real validator behind it and reads the
 * clause the injected finding ends with, which is what the model reads. The dose check is the one site
 * read off the CHIP instead: an overdose finding never reaches the prompt's records, so its referent is
 * what the wire publishes and nothing else. A drug only the ANSWER names is read off the chips too,
 * because only the post-answer pass puts it in play.
 *
 * <p><b>Hers is the SUBSTANCE, and not the row the question named</b>: a case over a fixture whose
 * question row her order does not resolve holds that. <b>And a drug every order of which is coded only
 * as a locally applied presentation keeps the proposal call where the data also files it outside those
 * groups</b>, because the question may be proposing that other presentation: review round 1 of PR #544
 * measured a Major bleeding finding about <em>"Can I start her on oral diclofenac?"</em> over a
 * {@code Voltaren gel} order losing its refusal. Review round 2 measured the gate firing where the data
 * files the drug under no other group, and two cases hold that it does not. The presentation is read off
 * each order's OWN ATC codes; a case with a systemic order of the same drug beside the gel, in both
 * orders, holds the gate's "every order", and one whose order mixes a locally applied code with systemic
 * ones its "every code". Mutate the gate and read the failures.
 *
 * <p><b>Established, and not merely resolved</b> (review round 3 of PR #544). Her orders' resolution holds
 * substances she need not take, and the cases over the shipped knowledge base that reach one — through a
 * brand two substances' rows share, a code the data files under two substances, and a bridged concept
 * filed on several — each sit beside a case where that same leg does establish the substance, so both
 * values of each leg are built. The gate asks the establishing orders alone, a drug the question lists as
 * current is not asked it, and the referent never widens the resolution: a case each.
