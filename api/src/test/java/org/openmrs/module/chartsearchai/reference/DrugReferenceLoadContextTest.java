/**
 * Issue #149: a {@code sourceFormat}/{@code dataFilePath} mismatch loads ZERO drug-reference
 * entries, which turns the whole drug-safety feature off, and used to be reported at INFO exactly
 * as a successful load ({@code ReferenceDataFiles} logged {@code "Loaded 0 …"} as cheerfully as
 * {@code "Loaded 2283 …"}). Every safety question then answers as though the patient had no
 * interactions, allergies or contraindications to find.
 *
 * <p>Both halves of that defect are pinned here, through the production load path
 * ({@link DrugReferenceService#getAll()} / {@link DrugReferenceService#getLoadStatus()} over the
 * real GPs and the real datasets the module ships):
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>Loud on empty.</b> A configured source that yields nothing is reported at WARN, and a
 * healthy load stays quiet. Asserted on the LEVEL, never the message text — an empty list is the
 * correct fail-safe return in both cases, so the level is the only observable difference, and a
 * text assertion would let a re-wording silently drop the guard.</li>
 * <li><b>Observable after the load.</b> The load is lazy, so reading the log line right after
 * flipping the GPs reads the PREVIOUS source's line. {@link DrugReferenceService#getLoadStatus()}
 * reports the load that is in force instead, triggering it if it has not happened yet.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The mismatch cases use the module's OWN two bundled datasets, copied into the application data
 * directory and cross-wired: each source format parses only its own shape and returns nothing —
 * without failing — for the other's. That is the real production defect, not a synthetic file.
