/**
 * Every production {@link DrugReferenceSource} declares its own validity channel.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is a structural guard and not a behavioural one.</b> Issue #266's defect was that
 * {@code sourceFormat=atc} had no validity channel at all, and the reason it went unnoticed for as long
 * as it did is that {@link DrugReferenceSource#lastLoadFindings()} and
 * {@link DrugReferenceSource#lastLoadOrigin()} are DEFAULTED interface methods. A source that does not
 * override them compiles, loads, answers questions, and reports an empty {@code findings} list on
 * {@code GET /chartsearchai/drugreferencestatus} — no exception, no log line, no failing test. It fails
 * closed and silently, which is the failure mode this whole check exists to prevent: {@code CLAUDE.md}'s
 * rule is that silence is the ABSENCE of a finding, never a muted one, and a channel that cannot carry
 * one is the strongest form of that violation.
 *
 * <p>So the thing to pin is not a behaviour but the presence of a declaration, and this repo's
 * established mechanism for that is a guard that reads its own source or compiled classes —
 * {@code DrugReferenceFindingLoudnessTest.everyRuleIsClassifiedAsDataOrAsConfiguration} by reflection
 * over the rule constants, {@code OrderPartnerNameSourceWritePathTest} by source scan,
 * {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroundingWithholdingTest} by compiled-class scan.
 *
 * <p><b>Discovery from the source FILE NAMES, membership by reflection</b>, and each half does something
 * the other cannot. Reflection alone cannot enumerate an interface's implementations, so a fourth source
 * format would simply not be looked at — the vacuous pass this guard is written against. But the source
 * must not be asked whether a class implements the interface: the first version of this test matched the
 * literal {@code "implements DrugReferenceSource"}, and a review agent refuted it in one move with a
 * probe class declaring {@code implements Serializable, DrugReferenceSource} — never enumerated, no
 * override, and the guard still green because the floor below was met by the three real sources. A
 * declaration can also be wrapped across a line, or reach the interface through a superclass. So the
 * source tree answers only which classes live in this package, and {@link Class#isAssignableFrom}
 * answers membership.
 *
 * <p><b>A file name is not the whole of "which classes live here", and the first version of this scan
 * said it was.</b> A NESTED type is a class in this package that a file-name walk does not see, and a
 * review agent demonstrated it: a {@code public static class} implementing the interface, declared
 * inside an existing file with neither accessor overridden, was never enumerated and the guard stayed
 * green. So each loaded class is asked for its own declared classes too. That is one more mechanism
 * closed, not the last one — a class in another package still escapes, which the residue below names.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does NOT cover</b>, stated rather than left to be discovered. A source that declares
 * both methods and returns a constant empty list from them passes here — declaring the channel is not
 * the same as using it, and no structural check can tell the two apart. What that leaves is a mistake
 * someone has to make deliberately, in a method whose javadoc says what it is for, rather than one made
 * by not writing anything at all; {@code CLAUDE.md}'s loader bullet carries the rule that closes it
 * (resolve through {@link ReferenceDataFiles}, never open your own stream). Nor does it reach a source
 * declared OUTSIDE this package — the scan reads this package's own source directory, so a source
 * anywhere else is invisible to it whatever its shape. Nor the groups loader, which is not a
 * {@link DrugReferenceSource} — its accessors are ordinary public methods
 * {@link DrugReferenceService} calls, so removing one breaks the build.
 *
 * <p>The scan asserts its own findings are non-empty, which the walking caller of
 * {@link ModuleSourceRoot#apiRoot()} owes itself: that method falls back to the working directory rather
 * than failing, so a walking caller that does not check can scan nothing and report no violations.
