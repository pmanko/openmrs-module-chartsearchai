/**
 * The load-time validity check: what the loader does when the dataset it was pointed at violates an
 * assumption the loader's own code makes (issues #150, #156, #211, and the check decided on #196).
 *
 * <p>Every RULE case here drives the REAL load — a file in the application data directory, the real
 * global properties, {@link DrugReferenceService#getAll()} / {@link DrugReferenceService#getLoadStatus()}
 * — for the reason CLAUDE.md gives and for one specific to this feature: the validity check runs where
 * the dataset is loaded, and the {@code setEntries} test seam deliberately bypasses all dataset loading,
 * so a case built through that seam would assert nothing about it.
 *
 * <p>One case is not about a rule and so does not:
 * {@link #everyDatasetFixtureOnTheTestClasspathParsesToEntriesUnderItsOwnParser} sweeps the FIXTURE
 * CORPUS through the real parsers directly, because what it asks — can a test written against this
 * fixture fail at all? — is a question about the files rather than about a load, and copying every one
 * of them into the application data directory to ask it would answer the same question more slowly.
 *
 * <p>Each case asserts THREE things, and needs all three: what the loader did to the data (or declined
 * to do), that it said so at WARN, and that {@link DrugReferenceLoad#getFindings()} names the rule after
 * the lazy load — which is the only way to ask "what was wrong with what I loaded?" without reading a log
 * line that, the load being lazy, may belong to a previous load (issue #149).

	 *       {@code Fluoroestradiól f-18} carries {@code estradiol} neither as a bounded word nor as a

	 *       one. Measured over the shipped 19 MB KB: none of its 2283 rows carries a non-ASCII
	 *       character in {@code name} or {@code rxnorm_name}, so this decision has no verbatim witness
	 *       and the file says it is hand-authored.</li>
	 *   <li><b>The one input the two halves can disagree about.</b> A substance name with no letter or
	 *       digit is non-blank to {@code normalizeName}, and {@code containsWord} refuses it while
	 *       {@code String.contains} finds it in whichever stems carry the character — so an
	 *       {@code rxnorm_name} of {@code "-"} makes {@code Bupivacaine hcl-2} a "derivative" of
	 *       {@code "-"} beside {@code Marcaine}. It fails OPEN, which is why the gate is a guard and
	 *       not a nicety. A marks-only token is not this witness: it folds to empty, every row of the
	 *       family then derives, and the parent gate silences it first.</li>
	 *   <li><b>What "merged" means.</b> A derivative that the module has correctly kept APART from its
	 *       parent, but which has a route variant of its own, is a family of two derivatives with no
	 *       parent in it. Reporting those states a merge that never happened — so the rule requires a

	 * <p><b>This sweep is a guard, not a repair</b>, and that is measured rather than assumed: of every
	 * version of every {@code ddi-} fixture in this repository's history, exactly one is mis-shaped, and
	 * it is {@link #DELIBERATELY_MIS_SHAPED} — added by this change. So no committed fixture was ever in

	 * like one that cannot: the mutation that shows this one can is removing the twin fixture's
	 * {@code interactions} key, which reddens it.
	 *
	 * <p>It drives the real parser over every dataset fixture on the test classpath and requires each to
	 * declare the tables its own parser needs and to produce at least one entry, so a fixture authored
	 * into that shape reddens here instead of quietly disarming whatever test is written against it.
	 * <b>All THREE parsers</b>, which is why the ATC sample is swept from its own directory rather than
	 * left out as the corpus's quiet second exception: it is a dataset fixture with a real parser and
	 * real dependants ({@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.atcService}), and one that parsed to nothing
	 * would disarm them in exactly the way this sweep exists to prevent. Its parser has a collector form
	 * since issue #266, but the rule it can report there ({@code no-line-yielded-an-entry}) fires exactly
	 * when it emits nothing, so for this leg the emptiness is still the whole check and the single-argument
	 * form is what it takes.
	 *
	 * <p>The one deliberate exception is asserted rather than skipped, so the exception cannot rot into a
	 * hole: {@link #DELIBERATELY_MIS_SHAPED} is the subject of the rule and MUST fire it.
	 *
