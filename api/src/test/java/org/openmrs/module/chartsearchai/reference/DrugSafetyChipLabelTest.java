/**
 * Synonym-augmented chip labels: a safety warning about a drug whose dataset display name
 * diverges from its everyday generic ("Acetylsalicylic acid" vs "aspirin") must carry both,
 * or the most critical chip on the page reads as if it concerns a different drug than the one
 * the clinician asked about and the chart records (measured 2026-07-29: "Is it safe to give
 * her aspirin?" produced a contraindication chip naming only "Acetylsalicylic acid" against a
 * chart allergy recorded as "Aspirin"). Renaming entries outright was measured and rejected:
 * of the full KB's 276 diverging names, most are INN-vs-USAN pairs or worse, and the lidocaine
 * route variants share one RxNorm name — a swap mistranslates or collapses them. So display
 * names stay, and labels append the generic as a parenthetical when it genuinely diverges.
 *
 * <p>The three parser-model cases here read the BUNDLED dataset, which since ADR Decision 36 is the whole
 * knowledge base — deliberately, and unlike the cases that reach for
 * {@link DrugReferenceTestSupport#ddinterEntries()}: each is a statement about what the parser does to
 * any real DDInter document rather than about one bounded slice, and the interning case reasons about the
 * full KB's ~300k rows explicitly, so the shipped dataset is the honest data for it rather than merely a
 * larger one.
