/**
 * The generic DDI screening question — "are there any drug interactions with her current
 * medications?" — screened against the patient's OWN active orders (issue #113).
 *
 * <p>Both existing arms key off drugs the QUESTION names, and a screening question names none:
 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.matchingEntries} scopes order-driven injection through
 * {@code relatedToAny}, which is false for an empty question-drug list, and
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate}'s {@code inPlay} then starts empty. So the module produced
 * 0 chips, {@code references: []} and "the records do not address drug interactions with current
 * medications" for the one question a DDI knowledge base is chiefly wanted for. Nothing needed
 * retrieving — the active orders are in {@link PatientClinicalContext} and each order's
 * {@link DrugReference} carries its full partner list; the two only needed cross-referencing.
 *
 * <p>Every scenario runs the REAL production path: the real bundled datasets parsed by the real
 * sources, the real {@code validate}/{@code injectRecords} entry points, real question strings, GP
 * reads on their no-context defaults (severity floor {@code minor}).
