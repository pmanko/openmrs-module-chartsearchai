/**
 * Severity floor for rule-based interaction chips (the #84 severity follow-up): DDInter's
 * per-row severity is now a structured field on {@link DrugReference.Interaction}, and rule
 * chips below {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.minInteractionSeverity} (default {@code minor})
 * are not raised. Measured motivation (2026-07-29, "Is it safe to give her aspirin?" on a
 * simvastatin patient): the severe-allergy contraindication chip shared equal billing with an
 * aspirin x simvastatin row of Unknown severity and no mechanism text — 42,415 of the full
 * KB's 295,184 rows (14%) are that shape, all information-free. The floor filters exactly
 * them by default while Major/Moderate/Minor rules, class-based chips, contraindications, and
 * curated rules without a severity (all deliberate, hand-authored) are untouched.
 *
 * <p>All scenarios run the real pipeline: real DDInter excerpt (or curated seed) parsed
 * by the real sources, real validate overloads, GP reads on their no-context defaults.
