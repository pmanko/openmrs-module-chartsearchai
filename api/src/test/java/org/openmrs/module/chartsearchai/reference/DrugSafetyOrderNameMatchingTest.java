/**
 * The two directions {@link DrugReference#matchesOrderName} has to satisfy at once, on the real
 * data that produced each of them. {@link HasActiveDrugWholeWordTest} pins the nested-name case
 * this fix started from ("chlorothiazide" inside "hydrochlorothiazide"); this class pins the two
 * live-reproduced fabrications that same nesting caused, and the localized order names that a
 * symmetric word boundary would have silently stopped checking.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Must not fire.</b> On the 3.7.1 standalone a patient on <b>Tiotropium</b> asked about
 *       linezolid was told of an active <b>opium</b> order at Major severity, mechanism text and
 *       all ("tiotr|opium"); a patient on <b>Spironolactone</b> asked about dolutegravir was told
 *       of an active <b>iron</b> order, twice ("sp|iron|olactone"). Neither concept carries an ATC
 *       mapping there, so the name arm alone produced both.</li>
 *   <li><b>Must still fire.</b> This deployment's dictionary is multilingual —
 *       {@code Aspirine Co 81mg}, {@code Aspirina}, {@code Clarithromycine Co 500mg},
 *       {@code Simvastatine}, {@code Multivitamines et fer} are all real rows in it. Requiring a
 *       symmetric boundary drops 135 of containment's 896 matches over that dictionary, and 68 of
 *       the dropped are localized spellings of the very token being matched, so those patients
 *       would silently stop being checked for interactions — a false negative dressed as noise
 *       removal.</li>
 *   <li><b>Must not fire, at the far edge.</b> The trailing allowance those localized names need is
 *       bounded, and the bound is pinned from both sides here: one letter short and
 *       {@code Multivitamines et fer} stops being checked, two letters long and
 *       {@code Heparinoids / salicylic acid} starts being read as heparin. Without the upper-edge
 *       case a later widening of the constant reinstates exactly the fabricated Major chips this
 *       class exists to prevent, and nothing fails.</li>
 *   <li><b>Must not fire in prose.</b> The allowance belongs to order names alone;
 *       {@link DrugReference#containsWord} keeps the symmetric boundary for prose. Collapsing the
 *       two matchers into one is what made #87 unsafe, and it can be done in either direction —
 *       the localized cases above catch a prose rule applied to order names, and this one catches
 *       the order-name rule applied to prose, where "aspiring" would be read as a proposal of
 *       aspirin.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Every scenario runs the real pipeline: real datasets parsed by the real sources, the real
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate(String, String, PatientClinicalContext)}, GP reads on their
 * no-context defaults (so the severity floor is the production {@code minor}). Each negative is
 * paired with the positive that proves the rule it must not fire on is live, so nothing here can
 * pass by resolving nothing.
