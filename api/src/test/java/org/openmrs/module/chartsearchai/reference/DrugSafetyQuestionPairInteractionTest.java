/**
 * The question-named PAIR arm (issue #114). Measured on the 3.7.1 standalone at HEAD
 * {@code 13690b1}: Mary Smith, active order Simvastatin 20mg, asked "Does warfarin interact with
 * aspirin?" got the answer "The records do not address the interaction between warfarin and
 * aspirin.", {@code references: []}, and exactly one chip — "Warfarin interacts with active order
 * simvastatin — <b>Minor</b>" — about a pair nobody asked about, while the pair she DID ask about
 * is rated Major in the loaded KB ({@code ["DDInter1951","DDInter20","Major","749"]}). The same
 * question fires correctly for Agnes Adams, whose chart carries Aspirin 81mg.
 *
 * <p>Cause: both drugs resolve from the question and both are validated, but each was only ever
 * checked against the CHART ({@code hasActiveDrug}), never against the other drug the question
 * named — so a two-drug question was silently reduced to two independent one-drug questions.
 *
 * <p>All scenarios run the real pipeline: real datasets — the DDInter excerpt and the curated
 * seed, plus {@link #PAIR_FIXTURE} for shapes neither carries — parsed by the real sources, real
 * {@code validate}/{@code injectRecords} overloads, GP reads on their no-context defaults.
