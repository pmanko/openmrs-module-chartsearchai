/**
 * Echo scoping for the answer side of {@link DrugSafetyValidator} (issues #105 and #360): a drug the
 * ANSWER names while a record the mention is ATTRIBUTABLE to already names it (a recited reference
 * partner, an allergy the answer reports off the chart) is a mention, not a proposal — it must not be
 * validated against the patient as if someone suggested prescribing it. A drug the QUESTION names, or
 * that the answer introduces on its own authority (no attributable record contains it), keeps the
 * full safety check.
 *
 * <p>Attributable is the union of two things, and which half a case exercises is the point of the
 * case. A chart record must be CITED inline — it is the patient's own data, so the marker is the
 * evidence that the answer was reporting it rather than proposing. A reference-group record needs no
 * citation: this module put it in the prompt and does not need the model to say so. Requiring one was
 * issue #360 — an answer that emitted no bracket had the whole of #105's scoping skipped, and recited
 * partners raised Major chips about drugs neither charted nor asked about.
 *
 * <p>The reference half is TWO record types and each has its own case, because the membership test is
 * the GROUP rather than a type name and the drug_reference-only narrowing of it is what the
 * predicate's javadoc records as tried and reverted. The finding half is pinned on the SCREENING arm
 * deliberately: a screening question injects no {@code drug_reference} record at all, so there that
 * narrowing is not a partial loss but the reported defect back in full.
 *
 * <p>All scenarios run the real pipeline: entries parsed from the real DDInter excerpt,
 * charts built by the real injector, and the real {@code validate} overload that production
 * calls with the chart's mappings.
