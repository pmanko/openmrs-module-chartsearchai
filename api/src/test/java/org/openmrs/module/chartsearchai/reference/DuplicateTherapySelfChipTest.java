/**
 * Whether the duplicate-therapy arm can report a drug as duplicating the patient's own order of that
 * same drug — issue #185.
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> {@code DrugSafetyValidator.classRelationships} skipped an active order that
 * is "the same drug as {@code ref}" by asking whether the two share an exact ATC code. That is a
 * proxy for identity — and in this knowledge base not even a sound one, since {@code Omeprazole}
 * and {@code Esomeprazole} share {@code A02BC05} and are two substances. What the arm needed was
 * the identity itself. Where the co-medication's code and the reference
 * row's code are different codes of one substance, the sets are disjoint, their level-4 subgroups
 * still meet, and the chip fires against the order itself:
 *
 * <pre>Omeprazole is in the same ATC class (A02BC) as active order Omeprazole 20mg</pre>
 *
 * <p>Identity is what the skip is actually about, so it asks
 * {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()} — the same correction issues #164/#187 made for the two
 * cross-reactivity routes to the same symptom, and the reason issue #173 built that key.
 *
 * <p><b>Two routes in, and they need different halves of the answer.</b> Both are pinned here, over
 * verbatim rows of the shipped 19 MB KB.
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The co-medication resolves to NO entry — the KB carries no row for its code — so only the
 *       ORDER'S NAME can say what it is. That is the PPI slice: the KB's {@code Omeprazole} row
 *       publishes {@code A02BC05} (esomeprazole's code, with {@code rxnorm_name} "esomeprazole") and
 *       omeprazole's own {@code A02BC01} appears nowhere in the KB.</li>
 *   <li>The co-medication DOES resolve, to a different substance, and the order's name names
 *       {@code ref} anyway — a combination. That is the isoniazid slice, and it is the one showing
 *       the leg is not a fallback for a partner that resolves to NOTHING: this one resolves, by
 *       code, to a substance that is not {@code ref}, and still needs its order's name.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>What must not move.</b> A duplicate-therapy chip against a DIFFERENT substance in the same
 * class is the finding this arm exists to make, so widening the skip into a blanket "the patient is
 * already on something in this class" suppression would be a worse defect than the one being fixed.
 * {@code Esomeprazole} is the case that catches it: it shares the {@code Omeprazole} row's
 * {@code rxnorm_name}, its {@code rxcui} and its one ATC code, and differs only in
 * {@code drugbank_id} — so it is a different substance by {@link DrugReference#substanceKey()} and
 * by nothing else the row publishes. Its chip must survive.
 *
 * <p>The second thing that must not move is WHICH accessor reads the order's name. It decides which
 * chips are silenced, so it is the ranked {@link DrugReferenceService#findImpliedByDrugName} and
 * never the matcher underneath it — measured here on issue #209's own case, where the unranked form
 * would suppress a real chip about {@code Hydrocortisone butyrate}. Swapping the two leaves the rest
 * of the suite green, which is why that case is in this file.
 *
 * <p>The third lives next door, in
 * {@code PartialOrderCoveragePartnerTest.askingAboutOneConstituentOfThatCombinationStillReportsTheOther},
 * because its fixture is the one that has a combination order resolving to TWO partners: what an
 * order NAMES may be read onto a partner named after that ORDER and not onto one the DATASET named,
 * or a question about one constituent silences the chip about the other.
