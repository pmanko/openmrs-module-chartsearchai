/**
 * A finding about a drug this patient's chart records only as an order no longer in force says so,
 * rather than reading as a proposal or as a current co-medication (issue #472).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> On a RefApp 3.7.1 standalone, a patient on Lamivudine and Nevirapine whose
 * Rifampicin order had been discontinued was asked about with <em>"Her current medications are
 * lamivudine, nevirapine and rifampicin. Any interactions?"</em> and <em>"Why was her rifampicin
 * stopped, and does it matter for her current medications?"</em>. Both raised a Major chip
 * "Rifampicin interacts with active order Nevirapine", and the answers read <em>"a reason to withhold
 * it"</em> and <em>"No — Rifampicin should not be given"</em>: the drug-in-play arm raises every
 * finding about a question-named drug as a PROPOSAL, and nothing in it read the chart's own in-force
 * stamp, which said the Rifampicin order was not in force.
 *
 * <p><b>What these cases drive.</b> The real {@code injectRecords} and the real {@code validate}, over
 * reference datasets the module loads (DDInter excerpts, and the curated seed for the allergy case), with the ended order's chart record carrying querystore's REAL rendered text
 * ({@link DrugReferenceTestSupport#querystoreRenderedText}) — so the premise that a stopped record's
 * text names its drug to {@code DrugReference.matchesText} is exercised against what querystore
 * writes, not against a literal typed here. Context-sensitive for that reason alone.
 *
 * <p>The clauses are LITERALS, as {@code CurrentMedicationFindingStrengthTest} keeps its own: the
 * prompt keys on these sentences, so a case comparing a constant to itself would stay green through a
 * reword that changed the call the model reads.
