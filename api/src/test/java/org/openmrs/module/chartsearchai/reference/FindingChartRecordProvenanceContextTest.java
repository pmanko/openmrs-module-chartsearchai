/**
 * Issue #305: an injected {@code safety_finding} names the chart record it fired on, so the
 * clinician can reach the source record whether or not the model cited it.
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> An answer can assert a fact about the patient's chart — "the patient's
 * allergy to Acetylsalicylic acid" — and cite no chart record for it, leaving only the module's own
 * {@code safety_finding} cited. Measured on the 3.7.1 standalone over two wordings of one question
 * a single character apart, agreeing on everything upstream of the model and disagreeing on whether
 * the allergy record was cited at all — so the click-through to the source record was decided by the
 * wording of the question. ADR Decision 80 carries the run counts and the arrangement; they are not
 * repeated here, because a measurement with three homes is a correction that reaches one of them.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it was unfixable downstream.</b> The provenance was discarded at read time:
 * {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder} read the patient's allergies and conditions into flat token
 * SETS, dropping each record's uuid, so {@link SafetyWarning} had no record to name and the injected
 * finding carried no link to the chart record behind it.
 *
 * <p><b>Context-sensitive and driven through the real builder</b>, because the defect is in what the
 * builder puts into the context: a hand-built {@link PatientClinicalContext} would bypass the whole
 * change. A real {@link Allergy} is saved through {@code PatientService} and a real {@link Condition}
 * through {@code ConditionService}, and the chart carries the querystore record shape for each — the
 * resource uuid being the {@code Allergy}/{@code Condition} uuid, which is
 * {@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.allergyRecord}'s measured contract.
 *
 * <p>Patient 7 is the arrangement, and its single active drug order (order 111, concept 88 "ASPIRIN")
 * is left in place rather than voided: it raises an INTERACTION finding beside the contraindication
 * under test, through the curated NSAID cross-reactivity group, and that second finding is what
 * {@link #anInteractionFindingNamesNoChartRecord} asserts about. So every case here selects the
 * finding it is about rather than asserting over a set.
