/**
 * Issue #292: inside ONE chip detail, one active order is named ONCE.
 *
 * <p>Issue #88's fold puts two arms' sentences into a single detail, and each arm named the partner
 * from its own source — the class arm by issue #155/#186/#290's ladder in
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.orderPartners} (the dataset entry's display label, else the ORDER's own
 * display where a code is dataset-unnameable, else the bare code or the {@code [ATC …]} stand-in), the
 * rule arm by {@code DrugSafetyValidator.partnerLabel}, which is the rule's own match token and
 * reaches nothing the context carries. So one prescription appeared under two names in one sentence.
 *
 * <p>The fix makes `partnerLabel` the ladder's last-but-one rung instead of a second, independent
 * ladder: a folded chip names the partner by the class arm's label where that ladder found a NAME and
 * the two arms are provably about one prescription — the rule's own token naming the ladder's ENTRY
 * unambiguously, or naming the very ORDER the label came from — and each arm keeps its own name where
 * they are not. Class-only chips and the grouping keys are untouched — see
 * {@code reconciledPartnerName}. Unfolded rule chips WERE untouched by #292 and are not since issue
 * #339, which asks that same method of every rule chip in both active-order arms:
 * {@code OneOrderNameAcrossOneResponseTest} is where that half lives, and the cases here still say what
 * they said, because a chip's two SENTENCES naming one order once is what this class is about. The injected {@code drug_reference} note list was untouched too, which is
 * the deviation issue #297 closed: it now takes that same reconciled name in its own vocabulary, and
 * {@code OneNameAcrossChipAndInjectedRecordTest} is where that half is pinned.
 *
 * <p>Driven through the real {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate} over datasets read by the real
 * parsers, because the defect is in what the two arms make of a real context: the bundled curated seed
 * through its real load path, the bundled DDInter sample, a pinned DDInter excerpt, and the json
 * fixtures named below.

	 * {@code ruleAbout} correlates through {@code entryForAtcCode}, which answers with the canonical row
	 * publishing a code, and a level-5 code can be published by two substances in this knowledge base

	 * carries one self-name, so the rule's token names exactly the row it belongs to. The shipped
	 * knowledge base is not like that: the {@code ddinter} parser writes each entry's aliases from its
	 * name AND its {@code rxnorm_name}, and its row named {@code Omeprazole} carries
	 * {@code rxnorm_name: esomeprazole} — measured on the pinned excerpt, that row really is
	 * {@code name=Omeprazole, rxnorm_name=esomeprazole}. A bare {@code isNamed} test therefore answers
	 * TRUE for the token {@code esomeprazole} against the {@code Omeprazole} row and would license the
	 * displacement on exactly the pair the guard exists to refuse — a rated mechanism about one substance
	 * printed under the other's name, and 25 of the shipped KB's 2093 rule tokens are named by more than
	 * one substance ({@code hydrocortisone}, {@code trastuzumab}, {@code gabapentin} …).
	 *
	 * <p>So the guard asks {@code unambiguouslyNames}, and since issue #296 what it asks is which substance
	 * the token claims most strongly rather than whether it claims only one. Here the ladder resolved the
	 * {@code Omeprazole} row, whose claim on {@code esomeprazole} is an alias while the {@code Esomeprazole}
	 * row's is its own display name — so the ladder's row loses and the displacement is refused, as it was
	 * before that issue and for a reason that now distinguishes this pair from
	 * {@link #aRuleTokenTheLaddersRowOutranksIsHandedToBothSentences}, where the ladder's row wins.
	 * This fixture reproduces the collision through the real parser — two rows publishing
	 * {@code A02BC05} and sharing the {@code rxnorm_name} the token is, while remaining two substances.
	 *
	 * <p>What separates them is the DISPLAY STEM, not the {@code drugbank_id}, and the difference matters
	 * to anyone regenerating this slice. Measured through the real parser, the two keys are
	 * {@code [esomeprazole, omeprazole]} and {@code [esomeprazole, esomeprazole]}: because the substance
	 * family {@code esomeprazole} names two DrugBank ids, {@code substanceKey} withholds the id and falls
	 * back to the stem of each row's own display name (contrast this fixture's {@code Pantoprazole},
	 * whose key keeps its id, {@code [pantoprazole, db00213]}). So keeping the ids distinct but letting
	 * the two display names share a stem collapses them into ONE substance and the ambiguity half of the
	 * guard stops being tested. Measured: renaming the second row to {@code Omeprazole (magnesium)} does
	 * collapse the keys, and this case then fails LOUDLY rather than passing — which is the good
	 * direction, and is why the warning is about a regenerated fixture reading as green elsewhere rather
	 * than about this case going quiet.

	 * <p>An order on the ladder's ORDER rung — the curated seed carries none of its three codes — whose
	 * display is BLANK but whose names are not. Its label is therefore a bare ATC code (the blank display
	 * resolves to the code). Before issue #293 this was the one shape in which the order-named branch
	 * could have said YES about a partner whose label is not a name — unlike {@code namedByCodesOnly} it
	 * had names for {@code namesNamingOrder} to scan — and it did not get the chance because
	 * {@code namesADrug} is false for a blank display and {@code reconciledPartnerName} asks that first.
	 * Since #293 the gate reads the DISPLAY instead, which is blank here, so both guards refuse
	 * independently; what this case still pins is unchanged, that the rule's own token goes
	 * to both sentences — exactly as for the nameless order in
	 * {@link #theTicketsLiveCaseNamesTheOrderOnce}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What this does and does not pin, stated because an earlier form of this javadoc got it
	 * wrong.</b> It is NOT a pin on issue #298's single-write-path invariant, and it was written believing
	 * it was. Under the mutation that motivated it — {@code OrderPartner.recordNameSource} admitting the
	 * order unconditionally, which is the pre-#298 state — this case still PASSES, because
	 * {@code reconciledPartnerName} reaches {@code !namesADrug} before it reaches the order branch and that
	 * branch order is deliberately kept (see ADR Decision 40). Measured by applying exactly that
	 * mutation: this class, {@code ClassChipPartnerLabelTest} and
	 * {@code NamelessActiveOrderPartnerTest} are all green under it. The write path is pinned
	 * structurally instead, by {@code OrderPartnerNameSourceWritePathTest}, a behaviour-neutral rule
	 * having nothing a behavioural assertion can see.
	 *
	 * <p>What it DOES pin is real and was pinned by nothing before: on this rung the label is a code, and

	 * codes absent by name.
	 *
	 * <p>Builder-unreachable, like {@link #aBlankDisplayNeverDisplacesTheDatasetName}, and for the same
	 * reason — {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder} takes a display from a name {@code addRaw} has
	 * already trimmed, whitespace-collapsed and dropped if blank. It needs the public constructor's latitude, which is what

	 * one question, so this asserts the invariant over two chips at once.
	 *
	 * <p>The REFUSAL arrangements are deliberately not swept here: a folded chip about two different
	 * co-medications, or about a rule with no name of its own, is MEANT to carry two names, so including
	 * them would make this assertion false for the right reason. There are SIX of them — the shared code,
	 * the ambiguous token, the tied token, the token-less rule, and the two shapes on the ORDER rung
	 * where the rule's token does not name the naming order. Each has its own case above, and the count
	 * below is what stops a missing arrangement from passing as a clean sweep.
	 *
	 * <p>The fifth SWEPT arrangement is the ORDER rung's reconciling half
	 * ({@link #anOrderSuppliedNameTheRulesTokenNamesIsHandedToBothSentences}), which the first version of
	 * this change refused along with those two. The other arrangement on that rung lives in
	 * {@code ClassChipPartnerLabelTest.anOrderTheDatasetDoesNotCoverIsNamedByItsOwnDisplayName} — the
	 * curated seed, where the ladder resolved no entry at all — and is asserted byte-exact there rather
	 * than swept here.
	 *
	 * <p>The sixth is the blank-display order of
	 * {@link #aBlankDisplayWithNamesNeverHandsItsCodeToBothSentences}, whose label is a bare ATC code and
	 * whose single name therefore comes from the rule's token.
	 *
	 * <p>The seventh, eighth and ninth are issue #296's, and each reconciles for a different reason:
	 * {@link #aRuleTokenTheLaddersRowOutranksIsHandedToBothSentences}, a token two substances name whose
	 * ladder row names it outright; {@link #aSiblingRowOfTheLaddersOwnSubstanceDoesNotContestTheToken},
	 * an uncontested token whose ladder row is the weaker-claiming presentation of its own substance; and
	 * {@link #aPaddedAliasNamesTheOneOrderOnce}, where the ranking would have refused had the alias
	 * reached it untrimmed.
	 *
	 * <p>The tenth is issue #339 review round 3's:
	 * {@link #aRowTheResponseElectsButTheTokenDoesNotClaimFallsBackToTheLaddersOwn}, the MAPPED order of
	 * {@link #TIED_TOKEN_FIXTURE} — the slice whose UNMAPPED order is the refusal
	 * {@link #aRuleTokenTheLaddersRowOnlyTiesKeepsItsOwnToken} above — whose elected row the rule's token
	 * does not claim and which therefore reconciles on the ladder's own row instead. Adding it to this
	 * sweep is why dropping that fallback reddens TWO cases in this class rather than that one alone:
	 * under the mutation the chip still folds and names this order {@code atropine} AND
	 * {@code Atropine (ophthalmic)}, so the one-name assertion below fails beside it — the count does
	 * not, the arrangement still being reached.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Adding the SIXTH — the blank-display order, whose label is a bare ATC code — required a
	 * second assertion to be worth anything.</b> The one-name property alone
	 * does not see the failure that arrangement is about: substituting the CODE for the name leaves
	 * exactly ONE name in both sentences, so the count below still passes. So the sweep also asserts that
	 * the name it counted is not ATC-CODE-SHAPED. Measured by making the {@code !namesADrug} branch hand
	 * out {@code OrderPartner.label} wherever that label is not an {@code [ATC …]} list, which is a
	 * code-for-name substitution on this arrangement and no other: two failures, the byte-exact case and
	 * this sweep's shape assertion, and nothing in {@code ClassChipPartnerLabelTest}. The count assertion
	 * stayed silent throughout, which is what the shape assertion is for. {@link #ATC_CODE_SHAPED} says
	 * which shapes that covers and which it deliberately does not.
	 *
	 * <p>One RECONCILING arrangement is excluded too, and for the opposite reason:
	 * {@link #aNamelessOrderCarryingTwoSubstancesCodesNamesTheClassSentenceAfterTheRulesDrug} names its
	 * one order once and would pass, but the name it settles on is false of the class relationship, so
	 * counting it here would read as one more clean reconciliation. So the count below is the number of
	 * arrangements whose single name is the RIGHT one, not of every folded chip this file builds.
