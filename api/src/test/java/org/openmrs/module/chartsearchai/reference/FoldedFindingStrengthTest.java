/**
 * A FOLDED finding — one chip asserting a rated interaction AND an unrated class relationship — states
 * the stronger of the two strengths (issue #283).
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> Issue #171's fold puts the class arm's duplicate-therapy sentence onto the
 * rated rule's chip when both arms are about the same co-medication, so one finding carries two claims
 * while {@link SafetyWarning#getSeverity()} keeps reporting the RULE's rating (deliberately — see
 * {@code interactionWarning}: folding must not raise or lower what the pair is rated). Grading the
 * strength clause off that rating alone made the fold LOWER the claim: a Minor-rated rule folded with a
 * duplicate-therapy relationship rendered "a caution to note", while the same relationship on its own
 * renders "a reason to withhold" because it is unrated. Same clinical facts, two strengths, decided by
 * whether a rated row happened to exist beside them.
 *
 * <p>It is also a behaviour change beyond what #283 set out to make. Before that issue every finding
 * produced a refusal, so a folded Minor pair refused; softening it was not measured and is not what the
 * report was about. The fold therefore takes the stronger claim, which leaves those pairs exactly where
 * they were and keeps #283 confined to findings whose only claim is the rated rule.
 *
 * <p><b>Not hypothetical.</b> Measured over the shipped knowledge base through the production
 * predicates — the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource#parse}, {@link DrugReference#atcSubgroups()} for
 * the subgroup test and {@link DrugReferenceService#lookupByToken} for the partner — <b>108 of the
 * 24,690</b> Minor-rated interaction ROWS the parsed model carries pair two drugs whose subgroups
 * intersect. The ROW is the honest unit here because a chip is raised per subject, so either
 * orientation can fold. The fixture is one of them, sliced verbatim (Methylphenidate × Modafinil,
 * rated Minor, both publishing {@code N06BA} — a subgroup named for a pharmacological action, so the
 * duplicate-therapy claim is licensed rather than vetoed by #183's bar).
 *
 * <p>This javadoc said "54 unordered pairs, each held by both entries", and review measured that
 * wrong — see {@code DrugSafetyValidator.licensesWithholding} for the full breakdown. Through the
 * same three predicates the 108 rows are <b>56</b> unordered display-name pairs, 18 of them held from
 * one side only, with multiplicities of 1, 2, 3 and 5 from the multi-row families. 54 was 108/2 and
 * not a second count, so the reconciliation with a raw-file scan that this paragraph claimed never
 * existed. The fixture pair itself is one of the 32 symmetric ones.
