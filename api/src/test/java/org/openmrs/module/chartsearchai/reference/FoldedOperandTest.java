/**
 * Each operand of the boundary scan is {@link DrugReference#foldedLower}-folded ONCE, where it is
 * produced, rather than once per comparison (issue #330).
 *
 * <p>{@code containsBoundedToken} folds BOTH of its operands at the innermost comparison, so every
 * caller holding one of them fixed re-derived it once per comparison. Measured through the real
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.validate} over the shipped 19 MB knowledge base and a 43-order chart,
 * that was 1,420,480 {@code foldedLower} calls in a one-drug pass and 1,927,548 in a ten-drug one —
 * two per comparison, one per operand, for two values that do not change.
 *
 * <p><b>The two operands have two different levels, and this class pins both.</b> An entry's own
 * ALIAS is fixed when the alias list is set; a scan's RECORDED NAME is fixed for the scan. So the
 * alias is folded in {@code setAliases} and the recorded name in the scan, and neither is folded
 * again below.
 *
 * <p><b>What each case can and cannot see.</b> A timing assertion would be flaky and machine-shaped,
 * so nothing here times anything — the argument this class makes is about WHERE the fold happens.
 * {@link #theRecordedNameIsFoldedOnceForAWholeScanAndNotOncePerEntry} asks it by object IDENTITY,
 * which is the only thing that separates a fold hoisted out of the loop from one written inside it:
 * a count cannot, because both spellings call the folded matcher exactly once per entry. Identity
 * says WHERE and never WHAT: a hoist folding only half of {@link DrugReference#foldedLower} hands
 * every entry of a sweep one instance just as a correct one does, so
 * {@link #theProseOperandIsDiacriticFoldedAndNotMerelyLowerCased} asks the other half of that line
 * by reaching a folded alias from an ACCENTED question.
 * {@link #anAccentedEntryKeepsItsPlaceBesideASiblingTheSameNameReaches} drives the two WITNESS scans,
 * whose compared operand the class-scope whitelist cannot see because both are entitled to name the raw
 * list; it needs a SECOND matching entry, since the narrowing those scans serve returns early on fewer
 * than two matches.
 * {@link #aWitnessIsTheAliasThatMatchedAndNotItsNeighbour} and
 * {@link #everyAliasOfALoadedEntryIsItsOwnWitness} ask the index alignment those two witness accessors
 * rest on: the first over the one fixture shape that exposes a skipped null, the second as a property
 * of whole loaded datasets, which is what reaches the edits — a collapsed duplicate, a filter — the
 * first cannot see.
 * {@link #anAccentedAliasIsTheOnlyNameOfAnEntryAnUnaccentedOrderReaches} drives the one shape in
 * which the alias-side fold is load-bearing at all — over every dataset the module ships,
 * {@link DrugReference#foldDiacritics} takes its ASCII fast path and returns the alias unchanged, so
 * a guard comparing a stored folded alias against {@code foldedLower} of the raw one is satisfied
 * element-for-element by the raw list and proves nothing. And the source scan pins what no
 * behavioural case reaches: {@code PatientClinicalContext.hasActiveDrug} compares through a static
 * matcher with no seam a probe can override, and a memo-shaped regression in {@code setAliases}
 * would be invisible to both.
