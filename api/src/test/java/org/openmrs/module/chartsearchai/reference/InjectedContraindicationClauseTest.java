/**
 * Issue #190 item 1 — {@code DrugReferenceInjector.render}'s {@code Contraindicated with:} clause
 * rendered one clause per contraindication ROW while
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.ContraindicationChips} raises one chip per
 * {@code (substance, type, token)} — or, since issue #146, per {@code (substance, substance)} for an
 * allergy rule naming its own entry — so the injected record and the chip beside it disagreed about how
 * many contraindications the entry has.
 *
 * <p>The two surfaces do not count the same POPULATION and are not being made to: the record renders
 * every clause the entry's rules render (a record is reference material about the drug) while the chip renders
 * the subset the patient's own chart matches. What they must agree on is the collapse UNIT, which is
 * what one rule authored twice exposes.
 *
 * <p>Curated-source-only by construction: the {@code ddinter} and {@code atc} sources publish no
 * contraindications at all (see {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}'s class javadoc), so only an
 * operator-authored file can file one rule twice. The bundled seed does not — its four ibuprofen rows
 * are four distinct keys, the self-named allergy one being the substance since issue #146 and the
 * other three their own {@code (type, token)} — which is why nothing shipped changes here and why
 * this needs a fixture.
 *
 * <p><b>Joining rather than dropping.</b> Issue #174 site 2 could drop a repeated row because the
 * repeats were near-identical; here the sibling notes differ in text, and they are operator-authored
 * clinical prose that this record is the only place the model ever sees. For THAT shape — two rules on
 * ONE key — the clause count follows the chip while both notes survive inside the one clause.
 *
 * <p><b>Issue #310 — and the other collapse unit, one along again.</b> The cases at the end of
 * this file are about two rules on DIFFERENT keys rendering one string, which the per-key map listed
 * twice. They are not a second reading of the paragraph above: #190 item 1 is one RULE counted twice
 * and is fixed by the KEY, while this is one STRING listed twice and is fixed by the string. Their
 * direction on the count is the opposite one too — after #310 this record can list FEWER clauses than
 * the entry raises chips. The paragraph on the two POPULATIONS above is what licenses that; the one on
 * the JOIN describes a different shape, in which the clause count does follow the chip.
 *
 * <p>Runs the REAL production path: the real {@link JsonDrugReferenceSource} parser over a fixture,
 * the real {@code injectRecords} and the real {@code validate}, GP reads on their no-context defaults.
