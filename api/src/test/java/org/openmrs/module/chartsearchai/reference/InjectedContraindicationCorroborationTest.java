/**
 * Issue #269 — WHAT CORROBORATES a self-named allergy rule's match, on the injected record.
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> Issue #267 stopped a bare-containment match from outranking the identity chip:
 * a self-named allergy rule no matched record names now chips at
 * {@code ContraindicationChips.SELF_NAMED_RULE_MATCHED_BY_CONTAINMENT_ALONE}, below {@code IDENTITY}.
 * The injected {@code drug_reference} record got no such treatment — it decided which half of the
 * patient-specific reading a clause went in from {@link DrugSafetyValidator#recordedContraindicationKind}
 * alone, which is the bare-containment MATCH — so for a patient whose only recorded allergy is
 * {@code Tiotropium} the record read
 * <pre>
 * Recorded for this patient: documented opium allergy
 * </pre>
 * and said it of a chart that records a tiotropium allergy. That reading is citable evidence (issue
 * #110), so the answer is <em>invited</em> to assert it, which is why the record is the sharper half of
 * the two: a demoted chip no longer displaces a true sentence, while a false clause in a record has
 * nothing displacing it at all. {@code SelfNamedAllergyRuleRankTest} recorded this as the deferral it
 * was, and {@code docs/adr.md} Decision 30's tail says the same.
 *
 * <p><b>The fix is a UNION of two corroborating questions, and neither half will do.</b> A clause stays
 * in the recorded half when EITHER an allergy record the rule matched NAMES the entry
 * ({@link DrugSafetyValidator#aMatchedRecordNamesTheEntry}, the chip rank's own predicate) OR the
 * allergen arm reads some recorded allergy as an allergy to the entry's substance
 * ({@link DrugSafetyValidator#allergicSubstanceKeys}, that arm's own identity question asked over the
 * whole allergy list). Each half alone is wrong, in opposite directions, and both are exercised below:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the rank's predicate ALONE understates — {@code allergensMatching("opium")} is
 * {@code [tiotropium]} even when {@code Papaveretum} is also on record, because
 * {@code papaveretum} does not contain {@code opium}, so a genuine opium allergy the allergen arm
 * chips would be hedged ({@link #aRecordedAllergyToTheSubstanceCorroboratesARuleItsOwnWitnessCannot});
 * <li>the allergen arm's set ALONE overstates — {@link DrugReferenceService#findImpliedSubstances}
 * admits equal claimants only at the strongest claimant's rank, so an allergy recorded as
 * {@code Ketoconazole} reaches the entry CALLED that and not one merely aliasing it, and a
 * self-named rule on the aliasing entry would be hedged while its chip stands at the full
 * {@code SELF_NAMED_RULE} rank ({@link #aRecordNamingTheEntryCorroboratesARuleTheAllergenArmCannot}).
 * </ul>
 * The union is monotone, which is the whole reason for it: it can hedge nothing either half admits,
 * so it can neither understate a recorded allergy nor disagree with a chip at full rank.
 *
 * <p><b>Marked, not denied and not dropped.</b> The clause goes to a third named section rather than to
 * the negative half, because the same injection still carries the demoted chip as a
 * {@code safety_finding} stating the contraindication with {@code STRENGTH_WITHHOLD} — deliberately,
 * per {@code SELF_NAMED_RULE_MATCHED_BY_CONTAINMENT_ALONE}'s own javadoc — and a flat "Not recorded for
 * this patient" beside it would be two citable records of one chart contradicting each other. Nor is it
 * dropped: {@code DrugReferenceInjector.render} records two live-measured failures of naming some
 * clauses and leaving the rest to inference.
 *
 * <p>Since issue #308 that finding carries {@code FINDING_UNCORROBORATED_MATCH} as well, so both
 * injected channels now say how the rule was matched — but its CALL is unchanged, which is why the
 * paragraph above still holds and why a denial here would still contradict it.
 *
 * <p>Every case that reads a RECORD drives the real {@code injectRecords} wired to the real
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator} over a dataset parsed by the real production parser, and reads the record
 * a model would read. {@link #theThreeSectionLeadsAreTheWordsAModelReads} reads no record — it is the
 * one case here that pins the READING's three section leads, whose words every other assertion takes
 * from production and therefore cannot see. {@code RULE_LIST_LEAD} is deliberately NOT among them: it
 * is a local literal, and rewording it in production reddens every case below that reads a record,
 * through {@link #record}'s own precondition — mutate it and read the failures rather than trusting a
 * tally, which the case added for the imply-vs-name leg had already made stale once.
