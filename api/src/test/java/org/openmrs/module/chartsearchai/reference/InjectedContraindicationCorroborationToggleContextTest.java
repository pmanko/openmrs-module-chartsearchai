/**
 * The third section of the contraindication reading (issue #269) stands down with the
 * {@code drugSafety} switches, like the two halves beside it.
 *
 * <p>{@code InjectedContraindicationReadingToggleContextTest} exists because a citable record must not
 * claim anything about the patient with the chips switched off, and it asserts both existing leads by
 * substring. The lead this file is about shares no substring with either, so that file cannot see it,
 * and its own arrangement is a CORROBORATED allergy which never renders this section at all — there is
 * no case there to extend.
 *
 * <p>The section does say something about the patient's chart ("Matched in this patient's chart …"),
 * which is what puts it on the switches' side of {@code render}'s divide rather than beside the
 * clause list or {@code rowAttribution}. Both directions are asserted, because a "no section" assertion
 * under a disabled flag proves nothing unless the same arrangement provably renders it when enabled.
