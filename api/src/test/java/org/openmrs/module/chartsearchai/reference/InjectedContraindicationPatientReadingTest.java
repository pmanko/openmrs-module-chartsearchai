/**
 * Issue #208 item 2 — {@code DrugReferenceInjector.render} lists EVERY contraindication rule an entry
 * carries while the chips list only the subset the patient's own chart matches, and the record said
 * nothing about which was which. Measured live on the 3.7.1 standalone: a patient with no recorded
 * gastrointestinal bleeding got an injected record reading
 * {@code Contraindicated with: … active gastrointestinal bleeding …} with no chip beside it, and the
 * record is injected as CITABLE evidence, so a model reporting what it can see can report a
 * contraindication that does not apply to this patient.
 *
 * <p><b>Marked, not filtered.</b> A drug's contraindications are properties of the drug, and this record
 * is the only reference material the prompt carries about it — filtering to the matched subset would make
 * the record disagree with itself between the two {@code validate} passes of one request (the pre-answer
 * pass and the chips pass see different rows IN PLAY — the answer widens that set deliberately, issue
 * #175; see {@code DrugSafetyValidator.resolvedSubstanceRows}, and not
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.SubstanceSubjects}, whose own answer stopped being moved by the ANSWER at
 * issue #238),
 * and would delete the operator-authored clinical prose that {@code InjectedContraindicationClauseTest}
 * exists to preserve. So the list is unchanged and the record states the patient-specific reading of it.
 *
 * <p><b>One predicate, two surfaces.</b> The reading is
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#recordedContraindicationKind}, the very method the chip arm decides a rule
 * has matched by — for the same reason {@code contraindicationFinding} is shared (issue #190 item 1): a
 * second copy is how a record and the chip beside it come to disagree, silently and in the direction of
 * asserting more than the chart supports.
 *
 * <p><b>Placed before the list it qualifies</b>, so a model reading forward has the qualifier before the
 * content — the same reason {@code orderedInteractionNotes} promotes the patient's own partners to the
 * front of the interactions section rather than appending them.
 *
 * <p>Every case runs the REAL production path: the SHIPPED curated seed and the real
 * {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource} sample through the real {@code injectRecords} and the real
 * {@code validate}, GP reads on their no-context defaults.
