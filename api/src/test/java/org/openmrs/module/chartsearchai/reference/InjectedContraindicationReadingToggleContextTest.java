/**
 * The injected record's patient-specific reading of a contraindication list (issue #208 item 2) is the
 * RECORD's half of a contraindication chip, so it stands down with the chips.
 *
 * <p>Neither toggle reaches {@code DrugReferenceInjector.injectRecords}, which gates itself on
 * {@code chartsearchai.drugReference.enabled} alone: the chips are gated further down, in
 * {@code preAnswerFindings} ({@code drugSafety.validateAnswers}) and in both contraindication arms
 * ({@code drugSafety.warnOnContraindications}). So an operator who switched contraindication reporting
 * off would have got a citable record asserting "Recorded for this patient: documented ibuprofen
 * allergy" into the prompt with no chip and no {@code safety_finding} record beside it — prose without a
 * chip, which is the divergence {@code preAnswerFindings} gates the first of those toggles to prevent,
 * and which {@code README} promises the {@code drugSafety.*} switches govern.
 *
 * <p>Context-sensitive because the point IS the global property, exactly as
 * {@link ContraindicationToggleContextTest} is for the arm it covers: the case writes a real GP through
 * the admin service and reads it back through the real {@code injectRecords}, so it cannot pass on the
 * hardcoded default. Every contextless case in {@code InjectedContraindicationPatientReadingTest} runs
 * with both GPs absent, which fails safe to {@code true}, so none of them can tell a rendering that
 * honours the operator's switch from one that ignores it.
 *
 * <p>Both directions are asserted for each switch: a "no reading" assertion under a disabled flag proves
 * nothing unless the same arrangement provably reads when it is enabled.
