/**
 * The one thing about issue #357's three-segment ordering that the shipped floor cannot show: that the
 * boundary between the promoted segment and the head of the tail is
 * {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.minInteractionSeverity} rather than the word {@code Unknown}.
 *
 * <p>At the shipped {@code minor} floor the middle segment can hold only {@code Unknown} rows — an
 * UNRATED rule is exempt from the floor rather than below it — so a {@code renderTier} that had
 * hardcoded that floor, or tested the rating rather than asking
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#configuredSeverityFloor}, would be indistinguishable there. Context-sensitive
 * because setting the global property needs a running context, which is the same reason
 * {@code PairChipExtentContextTest} is.
