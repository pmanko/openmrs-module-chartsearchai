/**
 * Issue #357 — a partner the patient is ACTUALLY ON, whose row the severity floor filtered, was
 * ordered with the drugs she has never taken and so was rendered behind them, or not at all.
 *
 * <p><b>What was reproduced.</b> Live on the 3.7.1 standalone over the bundled knowledge base
 * (2026-09-01, {@code main} @ {@code 9aca5790}, run twice identical), a patient on Lamivudine,
 * Nevirapine and Stavudine asked what the drug reference says about Metformin interactions got a
 * record naming {@code ketotifen} and {@code labetalol} — {@code Unknown}-rated rows with no
 * mechanism text, about drugs she is not on — while Metformin's rows against her own three drugs,
 * which are the same {@code Unknown}/no-text shape, were not rendered at all. "The render stopped
 * two positions short of Lamivudine in the entry's own partner order."
 *
 * <p><b>What the module now does.</b> {@code orderedInteractionNotes} ranks on relevance and rating
 * as two questions rather than one: the promoted segment is unchanged (the chart names the partner
 * AND the floor admits the rule), then the rules the chart names that the floor filtered, then the
 * dataset tail. Nothing about promotion, the segment-1 budget override, or any chip moves — the
 * ticket's own control is that no {@code Unknown} row may become a chip with a rating the source
 * does not give it.
 *
 * <p>Every case runs the REAL production path: the pinned 16-drug DDInter excerpt (and, for the
 * ticket's own drugs, the SHIPPED knowledge base) parsed by the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource},
 * the real {@code injectRecords} and the real {@code validate}, GP reads on their no-context
 * defaults (severity floor {@code minor}).
