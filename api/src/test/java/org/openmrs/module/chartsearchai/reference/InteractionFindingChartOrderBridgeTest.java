/**
 * Issue #349: an injected {@code safety_finding} states which of this patient's own active orders
 * each substance it names was resolved from, where the name that order DISPLAYS does not name it —
 * the silence test #349 shipped was every name the order RECORDS, and issue #347 narrowed it; see
 * {@code OneOrderNameAcrossAnswerAndChipTest}.
 *
 * <p>The reported shape: two active orders whose only chart names are the local brands
 * {@code Zolvimix} and {@code Klarizom}, resolved to Simvastatin and Clarithromycin through their WHO
 * ATC maps alone. The screening arm raised a correct Major chip and the answer read <em>"The records
 * do not address interactions between the patient's current medications."</em> — because the finding
 * named two substances the chart spells nowhere, so it was unciteable by construction and the model
 * resolved that by disclaiming. Nothing else in that prompt could supply the connection: a screening
 * question names no drug, so no {@code drug_reference} record is relevance-scoped in, and the chart
 * already substantiated both orders so no {@code active_drug_order} record was injected either
 * ({@code 0 active-order, 0 drug-reference, 1 safety-finding} in the ticket's own DEBUG line).
 *
 * <p><b>Additive, and never a renaming.</b> Which name the chip and the finding PRINT for a substance
 * is #339's settlement and is untouched here — {@link #theChipDetailIsTheWordsItAlwaysWas} is that
 * invariant. The clause states a RESOLUTION this module performed, in the module's own voice, and
 * asserts no class membership and no identity of the prescription, which is what #339's reverted
 * rounds 5–6 could not say of naming a constituent.
 *
 * <p><b>Scoped to the orders the PASS itself used, not to every order carrying the code.</b>
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.activeOrdersOtherThan} drops the subject's own orders before the partner
 * is witnessed, precisely so one prescription cannot report the two halves of one tablet as an
 * interacting pair; attributing the partner to an order that reduction refused would put that
 * suppressed witness back, in citable text carrying {@code STRENGTH_WITHHOLD}.
 * {@link #eachSubstanceIsAttributedOnlyToTheOrderThePassResolvedItFrom} is that property, on a
 * combination brand that carries BOTH codes.
 *
 * <p>Every case here drives the real {@code DrugReferenceInjector.injectRecords} wired to the real
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator} over a fixture parsed by the real production parser, and reads the
 * record a model would read.
 *
 * <p><b>Context-sensitive because the record NUMBER issue #379 appends to each item is gated, and
 * OFF on a stock install</b> — {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.citeOrderRecords}, ADR Decision 77,
 * whose "What is NOT measured" section is the reason. A contextless case runs with the property
 * absent, which fails safe to the default, so it could not tell a rendering that honours the flag
 * from one that ignores it. {@link #setUp} turns it on for every case here; the one case that turns
 * it back off, {@link #aStockInstallStatesNoRecordNumberAtAll}, is what pins the gate — flip the
 * shipped default to true and it is the case that reddens.

	 *
	 * <p>{@code .aRecordAnotherOrderIsCannotBeCitedForThisOne} is this rule at one record apiece, and
	 * it works by striking every record some active order carries the uuid OF out of the other orders'
	 * candidates. That strike was collected one number per ORDER, so where two records carried one
	 * uuid only the second was struck and the first stayed available — to be cited by a neighbour it
	 * merely NAMES, as the prescription it is not.
	 *
	 * <p>Here record [2] carries the Aspibrand order's uuid while its text names the Coagubrand
	 * order's drug, so the Coagubrand order reaches it by issue #118's name leg alone. Its own uuid
	 * record is absent, so without the strike that record is its only candidate and it cites it.
	 *
	 * <p><b>THREE records carry that uuid and the named one is the MIDDLE.</b> With two, the strike
	 * can be narrowed back to a single-element pick and stay green whenever the pick happens to land
	 * on the named record — measured: at two records with the named one first, striking the FIRST
	 * instead of all of them reddens nothing. No single-element pick survives this arrangement.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Both items move, and they move for different reasons</b> — the Aspibrand item by the
	 * uuid-leg refusal {@code .aRecordUuidTwoOfThisChartsRecordsCarryIsCitedByNeither} pins, the
	 * Coagubrand item by this one. They are separable by
	 * mutation and not by this arrangement: restore the strike to one number per order and this case
	 * alone reddens, while that one stays green.
