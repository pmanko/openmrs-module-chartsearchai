/**
 * One substance, one interaction chip per active order — however many rows the reference data files
 * that substance as (issue #162).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> {@code DrugSafetyValidator.addInteractionWarnings} ran once per entry in the
 * drugs-in-play set and {@code bestRulePerPartner} groups per PARTNER within one subject, so the
 * SUBJECT side was never grouped. One clinician-facing word resolves every route variant of a
 * substance ({@code findByQuery} returns every entry whose aliases match), so each variant raised its
 * own chip against the same order. Measured live on the 3.7.1 standalone — Sarah Taylor, "Is it safe
 * to give hydrocortisone?", one diclofenac order — as
 * {@code Hydrocortisone x diclofenac} AND {@code Hydrocortisone (ophthalmic) x diclofenac}.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is not a dedup.</b> The two rows carry DIFFERENT mechanism prose — one systemic, one
 * ophthalmic — so a survivor has to be chosen, and the chip's own subject label named a route the
 * clinician never asked about. Both halves are asserted here: which prose survives, and what the chip
 * calls the subject.
 *
 * <p>Slices taken verbatim from the shipped KB, driven through the real
 * {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource} parser and the real
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate(String, String, PatientClinicalContext)}.
