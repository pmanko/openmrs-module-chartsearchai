/**
 * How many duplicate-therapy chips an active order filed under SEVERAL ATC codes raises, and WHICH
 * of the shared subgroups the chip names (issue #171).
 *
 * <p><b>The two defects.</b> {@code DrugSafetyValidator.classRelationships} walked the patient's
 * active-order ATC codes and returned one sentence per code, and {@code addInteractionWarnings}
 * de-duplicated only the sentences that folded into an interaction rule. So:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>a partner filed under several codes raised one chip per SHARED subgroup, identical except
 *       for the class named — the demo dictionary's {@code Metronidazole} concept carries five
 *       {@code WHOATC} maps and shares three level-4 subgroups with tinidazole, with no rated KB row
 *       to fold into, so one clinical fact reached the clinician three times;</li>
 *   <li>when a rule DID fold, the surviving sentence was whichever code the concept dictionary
 *       happened to iterate first — the position-dependence issue #161/#166 removed from the
 *       allergy arm, still present here, and with the same consequence: a topical subgroup named as
 *       the reason for a systemic concern.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Both are fixed by the two arms sharing ONE decision — {@code sharedClass} over the partner's
 * whole code set — so this file pins the chip COUNT and the exact class named, through the real
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate} over verbatim rows of the shipped 19 MB KB. Since issues
 * #183/#184 that method takes the ARM as a parameter: the preference between candidates is still the
 * one decision, and the candidate sets are not, so the two arms may name different classes for one
 * pair. It is still one decision in one place, which is what fixes the two defects above.
