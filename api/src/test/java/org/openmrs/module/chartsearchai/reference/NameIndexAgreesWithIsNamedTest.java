 * <p><b>Why this is a property and not a pair of examples.</b> Issue #339 asks
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.unambiguouslyNames} once per rule chip rather than once per folded chip,
 * and the {@code getAll()} walk it used to collect a token's rival claimants by then grows with the
 * drugs in play — which {@code CoMedicationResolutionPerPassTest} forbids. So the dataset is inverted
 * once per pass and read back. The set of rival claimants is what decides whether one substance's
 * rated mechanism may be printed under another substance's name (issue #296), so an index that admits
 * or loses ONE claimant relative to the predicate is a silent mis-attribution rather than a slow
 * lookup — and it would be silent in exactly the tail nobody writes an example for.
 *
 * <p>Driven over datasets read by the real parsers, and asked of every name every entry carries as
 * well as of every rule TOKEN those datasets publish, which is the corpus the production caller
 * actually asks about.

	 * lower-cases and trims every alias it writes. So {@code corpus()}'s padded and upper-cased
	 * spellings exercise only the QUERY side — {@code entriesNamedBy}'s own {@code normalizeName} —

	 * normalisation reddens this one (re-measured at issue #339's review round 11 head). Nothing is
	 * claimed about the rest of the suite under that mutation.
	 *
	 * <p>The {@code json} source trims but does not lower-case, so an operator file can spell a name
	 * ONLY in mixed case — and it has to be a name no OTHER alias of that entry supplies in lower case,
	 * or the key is present under the mutation anyway and the case passes. The drift it catches is
	 * fail-OPEN: an index that
	 * loses a claimant makes {@code uniqueStrongestClaimant} more likely to answer true, so the gate
	 * PERMITS a displacement it should refuse — one substance's rated mechanism under another's name.
