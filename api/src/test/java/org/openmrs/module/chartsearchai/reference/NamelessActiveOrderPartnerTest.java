/**
 * Issue #290, the builder half: an active drug order the module cannot NAME still has to reach the
 * safety layer as one order.
 *
 * <p>Before the fix {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder} contributed such an order's ATC codes to the
 * flattened union and then skipped the order itself, so {@code DrugSafetyValidator.orderPartners} keyed
 * each of its codes on the raw code string ({@code identity = order != null ? order : (Object) orderCode})
 * and ONE prescription became one duplicate-therapy chip per code — each named by whatever the reference
 * data could resolve that code to alone, which is an unlabelled code only where the dataset carries none
 * of them. That is this file's arrangement, since the curated seed carries neither M01AE code; on the
 * shipped knowledge base a covered code took the entry rung and the chip named the substance.
 *
 * <p>Context-sensitive on purpose, and driven through the real
 * {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder#build(Patient)} then the real
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate(String, String, PatientClinicalContext)}: the defect is in what
 * the builder puts into the context, so a hand-built {@code ActiveDrugOrder} would bypass the entire
 * change. Patient 7's single active drug order (order 111, drug "ASPIRIN", concept 88) is the
 * arrangement, made nameless the only way the platform allows.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the names are voided by SQL and the ATC map is not</b> is
 * {@link DrugReferenceTestSupport#makeOrderNameless}'s own javadoc, which owns that argument now that
 * two packages build this arrangement. What belongs to this file rather than to the helper:
 * {@code Concept.getName()} returns null only for a concept none of whose non-voided names is a
 * preferred name, a fully specified name or a synonym — no count is given, because the builder's own
 * comment declines to enumerate the shapes and a SHORT-typed name is one this file's earlier "two
 * shapes" wording missed — and concept 88 carries TWO names, the FSN "ASPIRIN" and the synonym "ASA",
 * both of which the helper's void must therefore reach.
