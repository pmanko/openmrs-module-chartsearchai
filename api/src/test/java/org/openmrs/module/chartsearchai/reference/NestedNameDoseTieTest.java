/**
 * Issue #270: a dose stated for one substance charged to another whose name it contains.
 *
 * <p>{@code DrugSafetyValidator.substanceOwnsDose} gives a stated dose to a substance unless a DIFFERENT
 * substance's name sits <b>strictly</b> nearer the {@code N mg}. Where two published names nest, the two
 * occurrences sit at the SAME distance, so neither is strictly nearer, no veto fires on either side, and
 * BOTH substances claim the number — the shorter one warning about a dose the answer stated for the longer.
 *
 * <p><b>Co-location is not one fact but two, and that is why the nesting is posed twice.</b> The
 * metric is {@code pos < idx ? idx - pos : (pos > end ? pos - end : 0)}, so equal distance means equal
 * START when the dose precedes the names and equal END when it follows them. A prefix pair
 * ({@code estrone} inside {@code estrone sulfate}) ties only in the first arrangement and a suffix pair
 * ({@code clavulanate} inside {@code amoxicillin and clavulanate}) only in the second. A rule written for
 * one leaves the other reporting the same defect, which is what a same-start-index reading of this issue
 * would have shipped.
 *
 * <p><b>One case is the bound, and it is what stops the remedy being "the longer name wins".</b>
 * {@link #twoSubstancesEquallyNearADoseAndNeitherContainingTheOtherBothKeepIt} —
 * {@code Estrone} and {@code Clavulanate} do not nest and their names differ in length, so a blanket
 * tie-breaker would silence one of them while the sub-span rule leaves both — two substances equally near
 * a dose and neither containing the other is genuinely ambiguous prose, and this issue is about a text that
 * is NOT ambiguous. Without a length difference the case would pin nothing, because neither rule would
 * fire.
 *
 * <p><b>Containment disqualifies an OCCURRENCE, and it has to disqualify a VETO as well.</b> Dropping
 * the nested occurrence RAISES the substance's nearest distance, so on its own the filter handed the
 * container an ordinary strictly-nearer veto over a mention that is not nested at all: on
 * {@link #NAMED_NESTED_AND_INDEPENDENTLY} the combination's name ends 5 characters before the number and
 * the surviving standalone mention starts 7 after it, so the substance the clause doses BY NAME lost its
 * warning. Where the container publishes no band of its own that is not even a re-attribution — the
 * number goes unwarned by anybody ({@link #CONTAINER_PUBLISHES_NO_BAND}), the direction
 * {@code attributedDoses} forbids. So a rival that is only that near because the edge of its span facing
 * the dose is this substance's own name may not veto it either — and no wider than that, because a
 * container CAN be nearer by a word of its own ({@link #CONTAINER_NEAR_BY_ITS_OWN_WORD}), where barring it
 * would hand this substance a dose the per-row form never gave it. What the rule gives up
 * ({@link #FAR_STANDALONE_MENTION}) and what it does not exempt the substance from
 * ({@link #INDEPENDENT_RIVAL_BETWEEN}) are cases here rather than sentences in a comment.
 *
 * <p><b>And it disqualifies a veto from the OTHER side of the nesting too, which barring the container
 * does not reach.</b> With three names nested ({@code potassium} inside {@code clavulanate potassium}
 * inside the combination) the innermost is a rival standing on a span the filter has already discarded:
 * on {@link #RIVAL_NAMED_ONLY_INSIDE_THIS_SUBSTANCE} it vetoed the substance the clause doses by name and
 * nothing else published a ceiling, so that clause raised nothing at all. The bound is
 * {@link #DOSE_STATED_FOR_THE_INNER_NAME}, where the inner name IS stated on its own and keeps the dose —
 * a case rather than an argument, because barring a rival by the relation between the two NAMES instead
 * of by containment in this clause would reverse it.
 *
 * <p><b>And a rival can be nested in ANOTHER rival, which barring the container does not reach
 * either.</b> {@code dexamethasone} is the leading constituent of {@code Dexamethasone and
 * framycetin}, so on {@link #RIVAL_NAMED_ONLY_INSIDE_ANOTHER_RIVAL} it is nested in the span the filter
 * discarded the subject's own occurrence from while containing, and being contained by, no occurrence
 * of the subject at all — and it vetoed the substance the clause doses by name, in a clause where
 * nothing else publishes a ceiling. Round 2 declined that widening "for want of a case" on the
 * argument that such a rival must share the discarded occurrence's dose-facing edge; a leading
 * constituent is the third possibility that argument misses, and the reason no earlier round could pose
 * it is that the fixture carried its combination rows WITHOUT their leading constituents. It carries
 * them now, which is also what makes {@link #FAR_STANDALONE_MENTION} an assertion about the rule
 * rather than about a row's absence: with {@code Amoxicillin} in the knowledge base that case fails
 * without this bar.
 *
 * <p><b>Both of the filter's other costs are cases here as well</b>, so the predicate's javadoc claims
 * nothing this file cannot show: a substance whose only mention is nested loses the dose to nobody where
 * the container publishes no band ({@link #ONLY_MENTION_NESTED_AND_NO_BAND}, the accepted cost, and the
 * one that has to be told apart from the silence the veto scoping refuses), and a survivor can simply be
 * out of range ({@link #SURVIVOR_OUT_OF_RANGE}).
 *
 * <p>Every case runs the REAL production path: the fixture parsed by the real
 * {@link JsonDrugReferenceSource}, the real {@code validate} entry point, real question and answer strings.
