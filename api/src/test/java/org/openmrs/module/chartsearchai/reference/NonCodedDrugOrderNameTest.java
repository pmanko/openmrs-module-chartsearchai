/**
 * Issue #293: an active drug order the clinician recorded as FREE TEXT is named by its concept
 * rather than by the text they typed.
 *
 * <p>{@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder.addDrugName} read exactly two sources — the coded
 * {@code Drug}'s name and the order concept's name — and {@code DrugOrder.getDrugNonCoded()} had no
 * production caller anywhere in the module. A non-coded order is not nameless, so it never reached
 * issue #290's code-only rung; it arrived carrying the wrong name.
 *
 * <p><b>What a non-coded order's concept actually is, read off the platform rather than assumed.</b>
 * {@code OrderServiceImpl.ensureConceptIsSet} assigns {@code OrderService.getNonCodedDrugConcept()} —
 * the concept named by the {@code drugOrder.drugOther} global property, which {@code OpenmrsConstants}
 * describes as "the concept which represents drug other non coded" — whenever a non-coded drug order
 * reaches {@code saveOrder} with no concept of its own, and {@code DrugOrderValidator} treats exactly
 * that concept as the non-coded shape. So the placeholder is the platform's, by construction. A client
 * MAY supply a concept instead and keep it: {@code validateForRequireDrug} only objects when the
 * {@code drugOrder.requireDrug} global property is true, and its default is false. Both shapes appear
 * below — the placeholder wherever a case calls {@code nameTheConcept}, a client-supplied concept
 * wherever one does not.
 *
 * <p>Context-sensitive and driven through the real
 * {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder#build(Patient)} and then the real
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate(String, String, PatientClinicalContext)} or
 * {@link DrugReferenceInjector#injectRecords(PatientChart, PatientClinicalContext, String)}: the defect
 * is in what the builder puts into the context, so a hand-built {@code ActiveDrugOrder} would bypass the
 * whole change. Patient 7's single active drug order (order 111, drug "ASPIRIN", concept 88) is the
 * arrangement, made non-coded the way the platform records one — the coded drug cleared and
 * {@code drug_non_coded} carrying the clinician's text.
 *
 * <p>Two cases here are about the COLLECTOR rather than about orders: reading free text made
 * {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder.addRaw} the entry point for a string an order-entry user
 * authors, so it now collapses whitespace runs, and that binds every recorded string the builder
 * reads — an allergen's and a condition's included. They live here because the collapse is this
 * issue's change.

	 * The regression this change would otherwise have introduced, and the reason

	 *
	 * <p>That gate decides whether a FOLDED chip may print an order-supplied name in the RULE sentence
	 * (issue #292). Its premise was that one order's names are provably one drug's — true while they
	 * came from a coded {@code Drug} and its own concept, and false the moment {@code drugNonCoded} is
	 * read, because free text can name a different drug from the display and that row is savable
	 * wherever {@code drugOrder.requireDrug} is false. Scanning them all then proves a fact about one
	 * name and prints another: measured on this exact arrangement before the narrowing, the seed's
	 * WARFARIN rule rendered as {@code Ibuprofen interacts with active order ASPIRIN},
	 * with warfarin nowhere in the detail — and {@code DrugReferenceInjector.renderFinding} copies that
	 * detail verbatim into the prompt as a citable {@code safety_finding} carrying
	 * {@code STRENGTH_WITHHOLD}. The move is not purely a narrowing —
	 * {@code FoldedChipOnePartnerNameTest.anOrderWithNoMatchTokensIsStillJudgedOnTheNameItIsAboutToPrint}
	 * pins the one shape it PERMITS — and this case is the refusing leg.
	 *
	 * <p>The arrangement is the one {@code FoldedChipOnePartnerNameTest} reasons about, reached through
	 * the REAL builder instead of a hand-built context: order 111 keeps its coded {@code ASPIRIN} drug,
	 * so the display stays {@code ASPIRIN}; its concept carries {@code B01AA03} (warfarin, which the
	 * curated seed cannot name, so the partner is order-keyed and labelled by the display) beside
	 * {@code N02BA01}; and the free text {@code Warfarin 5mg} is the second name that would have
	 * licensed the displacement.
	 *
	 * <p>The aspirin code raises its own unfolded chip beside the folded one, so this arrangement does
	 * name one prescription two ways across two chips — issue #136's pre-existing shape, which is the
	 * cost the narrowing accepts and is asserted here rather than hidden, because it is categorically
	 * different from printing one substance's rated mechanism under another substance's name.
