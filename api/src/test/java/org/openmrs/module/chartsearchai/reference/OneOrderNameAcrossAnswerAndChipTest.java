/**
 * Issue #347: one response named one active order two ways — the ANSWER prose printed the chart's
 * brand ({@code active order Advil}) and the CHIP printed the knowledge base's substance
 * ({@code active order Ibuprofen}), for the one prescription citation {@code [2]} resolved to.
 * Neither name is false, which is why the chip side must not be re-decided (CLAUDE.md, and #339's
 * reverted rounds 5–6); what was missing is the CORRESPONDENCE between the two.
 *
 * <p><b>Why #349's clause was silent on exactly this shape.</b> That issue built the mechanism that
 * states the correspondence — {@code DrugSafetyValidator.chartOrderBridges} decides it and
 * {@link DrugReferenceInjector#FINDING_CHART_ORDER_LEAD} renders it as {@code "<Substance> from
 * <order display>"} inside the injected {@code safety_finding} — and, on an install that sets
 * {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.citeOrderRecords}, the number of the chart record that order is
 * (issue #379, off by default, which is why the clause here carries none). Its silence test asked whether ANY
 * name the order RECORDS reaches the substance, and
 * {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder.addDrugName} puts the order's CONCEPT name into that set
 * beside its drug-row name. So an order displayed {@code Advil 400mg} on concept {@code Ibuprofen}
 * satisfied the silence test through {@code Ibuprofen} — a name that reaches no prompt text at all,
 * because querystore's {@code DrugOrderRecordSerializer} renders exactly ONE name per drug-order
 * record ({@code drug.getName()} where non-blank, else the concept's preferred name, never both).
 * {@code QuerystoreDrugOrderDisplayedNameTest} pins that measurement against the real serializer.
 *
 * <p>The shape below is the ticket's, in the vocabulary the pre-existing verbatim DDInter slice
 * already carries: {@code Coagubrand} standing for {@code Advil 400mg} — a brand-named order whose
 * concept name {@code Warfarin} is a name the module records and the chart's own records do not
 * spell — beside {@code Aspirin 81mg}, whose display DOES reach its substance through the alias
 * {@code aspirin} and which must therefore stay unbridged.
 *
 * <p>One case gives that brand-named order the CIEL concept the ticket's own prescription carries and
 * drops its ATC codes ({@link #aBrandNamedOrderJoinedByItsBridgedConceptIsBridgedToTheSubstanceToo}),
 * which is the arrangement production builds; the other orders here carry no concept, so issue
 * #353's ambiguity refusal has nothing of its own to weigh for them.
 *
 * <p>Every case drives the real {@code DrugReferenceInjector.injectRecords} wired to the real
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator} over a fixture parsed by the real production parser, and reads the
 * record a model would read. The prompt is one half of the fix; the deterministic half a
 * {@code /search} consumer reads is {@code ChartSearchAiChartOrderBridgeTest}.
