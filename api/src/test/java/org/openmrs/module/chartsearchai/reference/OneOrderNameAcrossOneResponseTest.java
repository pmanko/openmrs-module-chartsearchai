/**
 * Issue #339: ONE response names ONE active order ONE way, and the same pair is named the same way
 * whichever question reached it.

 * BETWEEN chips. {@code DrugSafetyValidator.reconciledPartnerName} had exactly one call site, inside the
 * {@code classRelationships} loop, so which name an order got was decided by whether the class arm
 * happened to have a sentence about it: a rule whose partner shared a class was reconciled to the
 * ladder's clinician-facing name, and every other rule chip kept {@code partnerLabel}, the knowledge
 * base's own match token. Measured live on the 3.7.1 standalone at {@code 09717dc7}, one payload with
 * subject {@code Hydrocortisone} carried {@code active order celecoxib} / {@code diclofenac} /
 * {@code ibuprofen} beside {@code active order Dexamethasone} / {@code Prednisone} /
 * {@code Budesonide} / {@code Methylprednisolone}.
 *
 * <p>Driven through the real {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate} over the pinned DDInter excerpt read
 * by the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}, plus the real curated cross-reactivity groups — the
 * aspirin/ibuprofen pair is the one pair that excerpt trips on BOTH arms, so it is the pair that folds

	 * {@code Levobunolol is in the same ATC class (S01ED) as active order Dorzolamide (ophthalmic)},

	 * {@code Ibuprofen / Famotidine} order ({@code M01AE51}, uncovered, and {@code A02BA03}) named that
	 * one prescription FOUR ways in one response — {@code famotidine}, {@code ibuprofen},
	 * {@code Famotidine} and {@code famotidine} again — two of them under an M01AE claim famotidine
	 * does not answer.

	 * driven through this same fixture in a worktree at {@code abb36813}, all three read

	 * {@code classPartnerName}: that one is the ENTRY rung, where the two elections of one substance
	 * can pick two ROWS ({@code Atropine} against {@code Atropine (ophthalmic)}) on a condition that is
	 * per RULE — the rule's token claiming one row and not the other — so no class-only chip can read
	 * it. The chips reach the prompt verbatim through {@code DrugReferenceInjector.renderFinding} as
