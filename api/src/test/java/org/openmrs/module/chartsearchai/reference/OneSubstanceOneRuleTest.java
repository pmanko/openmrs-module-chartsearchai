/**
 * Issues #189 and #175 — <b>one substance, one rule</b>. Every arm already agrees on which SUBSTANCE
 * a chip is about (issues #162/#174) and on what to call it (#187/#192). What none of them agreed on
 * is which of that substance's ROWS supplies the rule they quote: the survivor was whichever row the
 * dataset listed first, not the most severe or the most apt.
 *
 * <p>Three arms, one defect:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>#189, the screening arm</b> ({@code addActiveOrderPairInteractions}) asked
 *       {@code bestRulePerPartner} about ONE row at a time and collapsed the siblings on its own
 *       pair key, so the first row to reach a pair kept the chip whatever its rating;</li>
 *   <li><b>#189, the question-PAIR arm</b> ({@code addQuestionPairInteractions}) kept the first
 *       ENTRY PAIR to reach a clinical pair, for the same reason;</li>
 *   <li><b>#175, the drug-in-play arm</b> ({@code addInteractionWarnings}) sees only the rows the
 *       question and answer TEXT resolved. Where the patient's own order name resolves more of them
 *       its chip could carry a milder rule than the screen would have raised — and since issue #173
 *       the screen stands down from a pair that arm reported, so the more severe row was never
 *       reported at all. That is the one place in this cluster where the surviving chip was not
 *       provably equivalent to the one it replaced, and the direction is under-warning.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Every scenario runs the REAL production path: verbatim DDInter KB slices parsed by the real
 * {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}, the real {@code validate} entry point, real question and answer
 * strings, GP reads on their no-context defaults.
