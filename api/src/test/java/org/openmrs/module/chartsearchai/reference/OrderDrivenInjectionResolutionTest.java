/**
 * Order-driven reference injection resolves the patient's active orders the SAME way the chip layer
 * does — {@code DrugReferenceService.findForActiveOrders}, ATC ∪ name (issue #151) and, since issue
 * #353, ∪ the concept each order was written against.
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> {@code DrugReferenceInjector.matchingEntries} resolved its order-driven leg
 * through {@code findByActiveOrders} — the ATC-only primitive — while
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.validate} has screened the union since issue #148 extracted it into
 * {@code findForActiveOrders}. So the injector decided an order's RELEVANCE from the reference entry's own ATC codes
 * ({@code relatedToAny}) but its MEMBERSHIP from the ORDER's concept mappings, and only the second of
 * those is sparse: an order whose concept carries no {@code WHOATC} map was invisible to the leg even
 * where the knowledge base publishes that drug's ATC codes perfectly well and the two drugs are in
 * one family.
 *
 * <p><b>What that costs.</b> The chip still fires — it is computed off the union — and since issue
 * #110 it is itself injected as a citable {@code safety_finding} record, so the finding is never
 * unsupported prose. What is missing is the active order's own {@code drug_reference} monograph: the
 * record the injector's relevance rule says a duplicate-therapy / cross-reactivity question is
 * entitled to. The clinician's question is about a drug in the same family as one the patient is
 * already on, and the reference material for the one they are on is absent from the prompt.
 *
 * <p><b>What this does NOT change.</b> {@code relatedToAny} is untouched: order-driven injection stays
 * relevance-scoped, so an active order that is in no shared family with the question's drug is still
 * not injected however it resolved ({@link #anUnrelatedActiveOrderResolvedByNameIsStillNotInjected}),
 * and a question naming no drug still injects nothing from this leg. The change is to the candidate
 * set; what a wider candidate set then carries through the unchanged collapse is set out on
 * {@link DrugReferenceInjector#matchingEntries}.
 *
 * <p>Every injection case here drives the real {@link DrugReferenceInjector#injectRecords} with the
 * real {@link DrugSafetyValidator} behind it, so a chip assertion and a record assertion in one case
 * describe one production pass. The premise case calls the service accessors directly — it is stating
 * what the arrangement IS, not what it does — and the two route-variant cases run the real
 * {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource} over a test fixture rather than the DDInter excerpt, which carries no
 * entry the knowledge base classifies nowhere.
