/**
 * Build-time guard on the ONE write path for {@code OrderPartner.namingOrder} and
 * {@code OrderPartner.namesADrug} (issue #298): both fields are assigned by
 * {@code OrderPartner.recordNameSource} and by nothing else, and the order is admitted there only where
 * the flag says the label is a name.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a structural guard and not a behavioural one.</b> The two fields carry one fact — that a
 * partner's label is a drug NAME, and which active order supplied it. Written independently they could
 * come apart: before #298 the ladder's order rung handed the constructor an order unconditionally while
 * passing {@code displayNamesADrug(order)} as the flag, so a {@code namedByCodesOnly} or blank-display
 * order produced a non-null {@code namingOrder} beside a label that is a bare ATC code or an
 * {@code [ATC …]} stand-in. Nothing observable went wrong, because
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.reconciledPartnerName} asks {@code !namesADrug} first and so never reaches the
 * order branch for such a partner — and that branch order is deliberately KEPT (see that method and ADR
 * Decision 40), which is exactly why the single write path has nothing a behavioural assertion can see.
 * Measured while implementing #298: the write path alone changes no test expectation in the api suite.
 * A rule that is behaviour-neutral by construction is either pinned structurally or not pinned at all,
 * and this repo already takes that route once — {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroundingWithholdingTest}
 * scans the controller's compiled class files for a hardcoded resource-type name. The reason there is
 * one step narrower than this one, and was overstated until issue #354: that rule is NOT
 * behaviour-neutral by construction, and since a third reference-group type exists its behavioural
 * sweep does catch a hardcode that has fallen behind the classifier. What no behavioural assertion
 * there can see is a hardcode that still AGREES with the classifier — which is the same shape as this
 * write path, and is why the precedent holds.
 *
 * <p><b>Mechanism: the Java SOURCE, not the class files.</b> The precedent reads bytecode because its
 * needle is a string CONSTANT, which javac inlines into the constant pool. The needle here is the
 * LOCATION of an assignment — which method it sits in — and a class file answers that only through a
 * bytecode parser (a {@code putfield} inside one method's {@code Code} attribute rather than another's);
 * this module has no bytecode library on the test classpath and adding one to ask a question the source
 * answers directly would be the heavier choice. {@code ArchitectureGuardTest} in the api module already
 * establishes source scanning as this repo's second structural mechanism.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does NOT cover.</b> Assignment by reflection, and an assignment written in a form this
 * pattern does not describe (it matches {@code <name> =} and the compound operators, so it sees
 * {@code this.namingOrder = …}, {@code partner.namingOrder = …} and a bare {@code namingOrder = …}; a
 * value smuggled in some other way it would not). It scans one file, which is the whole scope the
 * compiler leaves open: both fields are private members of a private nested class, so only
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.java} can compile a write to either, and the compiler covers every other
 * file. It reads ASSIGNMENTS and never CALLS, so it says nothing about a caller that hands
 * {@code recordNameSource} a pair that is consistent and FALSE — a rung added later that writes
 * {@code label} itself and then records an order that label was not taken from. That residue is
 * semantic, it is of the same class as the defect issue #298 removed, and nothing in this repo pins it;
 * ADR Decision 40's trade-offs are where it is recorded. And it is a statement about the source as
 * WRITTEN, so a refactor that renames either field — or {@code recordNameSource}'s {@code order}
 * parameter, or one of its two statements re-expressed in a form that means the same thing — must
 * update the needles; that failure is loud rather than silent, which is the last paragraph below.
 *
 * <p><b>The two statements are pinned by SHAPE, because the weaker form of that forbade nothing.</b>
 * Until round 2 of issue #298's review the gate case asserted only that the assigned expression
 * CONTAINED the token {@code namesADrug}, and this javadoc said an ungated write "is caught
 * behaviourally instead". Both halves were wrong together, which is what made it invisible:
 * {@code this.namingOrder = order != null || namesADrug ? order : null} and
 * {@code this.namingOrder = namesADrug || true ? order : null} each name the flag, so each passed that
 * check, and each means exactly {@code this.namingOrder = order} for every non-null order — the pre-#298
 * state, an order recorded beside a label that is a bare ATC code or an {@code [ATC …]} stand-in. The
 * plausible slip is an {@code &&}/{@code ||} typo in a defensive null check, not a contrived edit.
 * Both of {@code recordNameSource}'s statements are therefore compared to the expression they must BE,
 * with whitespace removed and nothing else normalized.
 *
 * <p><b>Which channel catches which shape</b>, so that neither is credited with the other's coverage.
 * Measured on this branch (head {@code 38b5b508}, this change applied), each shape written into
 * {@code recordNameSource} alone and the whole build run:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code this.namingOrder = order} — <b>one</b> failure, this class's shape assertion.</li>
 *   <li>Both flag-naming forms above — <b>one</b> failure each, this class's shape assertion. The token
 *       check that assertion replaced caught only the bare {@code order} above; these two passed it, so
 *       two ways of writing the pre-#298 state were green until this round.</li>
 *   <li>The INVERTED {@code namesADrug ? null : order} — this class, <b>and</b>
 *       {@code ClassChipPartnerLabelTest.anOrderTheDatasetDoesNotCoverIsNamedByItsOwnDisplayName} and
 *       {@code FoldedChipOnePartnerNameTest}
 *       {@code .anOrderSuppliedNameTheRulesTokenDoesNotNameIsNeverHandedToTheRuleSentence}, because an
 *       order-rung partner then carries no naming order and the fold refuses where it should
 *       reconcile.</li>
 *   <li>{@code this.namesADrug = true}, a flag write that ignores its parameter — this class, <b>and</b>
 *       four cases in {@code FoldedChipOnePartnerNameTest}. This class's flag assertion is not what
 *       stands between that shape and a green build; it is added for symmetry, and because nothing
 *       checked that statement's right-hand side at all.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>So the shapes that make the recorded order UNCONDITIONAL are the ones nothing else sees, and they
 * are why this class exists. The other two it catches first and more legibly, which is not the same
 * claim and must not be reported as one.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it cannot pass vacuously</b>, which is the failure the cited precedent exists to prevent —
 * a guard that finds nothing and reports success. Every assertion about the assignments is preceded by
 * one that the scan located what it is talking about: the {@code OrderPartner} class body, the
 * {@code recordNameSource} body inside it, and BOTH field declarations by the exact names the assignment
 * pattern searches for. So a rename, a moved nested class, an unreadable file or a brace-matching failure
 * fails this class loudly instead of quietly forbidding nothing. The number of assignments is asserted
 * too, so a write ADDED beside the two expected ones fails even if it happens to sit inside
 * {@code recordNameSource}.
