/**
 * Issue #194 — the interaction chip's subject was {@link DrugReference#canonicalRow}'s pick, and where
 * the rows of a family TIE on that fold's rungs it can only keep the dataset's first. So a patient
 * ordered one presentation was told about another: live-measured on the 3.7.1 standalone, a
 * {@code Botulinum toxin type A} order was subjected on
 * {@code Daxibotulinumtoxina (botulinum toxin type a)}, because at the time the fold had one rung and
 * both rows answered it.
 *
 * <p>That family no longer ties. Issue #250 gave the fold a second rung — the row the data files the
 * family under — which is {@code Botulinum toxin type A}, so the fold now reaches this file's answer
 * unaided and the botulinum cases below can no longer fail if the chart-anchoring step is removed. The
 * trap moved to the COVID pair in the same fixture, whose rows tie on both rungs; see
 * {@link #theOrderNamedRowIsNamedWhereTheFoldCannotReachIt}.
 *
 * <p>Not the same defect as issue #176/#192, which was {@code lookupByToken}'s resolution of a
 * recorded ALLERGEN name, and not #188's collapse of the injector's notes. This one arrives through
 * the choice of representative row for an ORDER, and the constraint it has to respect is the one
 * issue #187 settled and #192 re-measured: naming the row the CHART records is what makes a finding
 * truthful, so {@code canonicalRow} may not simply be applied to a recorded name (it renames a
 * charted {@code Ketorolac (ophthalmic)} allergy). The rule is therefore "prefer the row the
 * patient's own record names most strongly, and fall back to the canonical row when nothing does" —
 * the ranking issue #192 introduced ({@link DrugReference#nameMatchStrength}), applied to the order
 * side.
 *
 * <p>The fallback half is already covered elsewhere and deliberately not re-asserted here: every
 * order name in {@code ScreeningSubjectLabelTest} and in
 * {@code InteractionRouteVariantTest.aSubstanceWithNoRouteUnspecifiedRowStillRaisesOneChip} carries a
 * strength or a form suffix, so no row's own name IS the recorded name and those cases exercise the
 * {@code canonicalRow} fallback. Still unchanged by issue #250's second rung, and checked rather than
 * assumed: that rung needs a row whose display name IS its own {@code substanceName}, and the families
 * those two cases turn on have none reachable — the oxymetazoline rows are all route-qualified, and the
 * chloroprocaine pair is decided by the FIRST rung before the second is consulted.
 *
 * <p>Every scenario runs the REAL production path: a verbatim DDInter KB slice parsed by the real
 * {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}, the real {@code validate} entry point, real question strings, GP
 * reads on their no-context defaults.
