/**
 * Issue #174 site 4 — {@code DrugSafetyValidator.addOverdose} ran once per reference ROW, so a
 * substance the data files as several rows produced one dose warning per row, each named after its
 * own row.
 *
 * <p><b>Latent on shipped data, and that is the whole reason it is swept here rather than waited
 * for.</b> An overdose warning needs {@code ageBands}, which only the curated {@code json} schema
 * carries, and the grouping needs a {@code substanceName}, which no bundled dataset sets on a
 * curated entry — the {@code ddinter} source publishes substance names but no dosing, and the
 * shipped curated seed publishes dosing but no substance names. It becomes reachable the moment an
 * operator authors a file that does both, which the curated schema explicitly permits (see
 * {@link DrugReference#getSubstanceName()}: "a hand-authored file that sets this field opts into
 * the grouping"). The fixture here is that file.
 *
 * <p>Every scenario runs the REAL production path: the fixture parsed by the real
 * {@link JsonDrugReferenceSource}, the real {@code validate} entry point, GP reads on their
 * no-context defaults.
