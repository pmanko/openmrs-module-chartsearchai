/**
 * The pair-chip cap as a global property (issue #131): {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.maxPairChips},
 * read by BOTH pairwise arms — the question's own drugs checked against each other (#114) and the
 * patient's active orders checked against each other (#113).
 *
 * <p>The cap was hardcoded to 10 in two places. Measured live on the 3.7.1 standalone against the
 * FULL DDInter knowledge base (2026-08-05), the question below logged {@code 10 of 72 … (cap 10)} and
 * withheld {@code [Major ×13, Moderate ×40, Minor ×9]} — sixteen medications reviewed, ten Majors
 * shown, thirteen withheld — and the number that decides which is a clinical judgement no module
 * should fix at build time. (Issue #131 reports {@code 10 of 65} for a differently-worded 16-drug
 * question, not in the tree and not reproduced here.) Uncapped is not the alternative: this question
 * produced 72 chips carrying 42,708 characters of injected finding text.
 *
 * <p>Context-sensitive because the point is the GP: the cases write a real global property through the
 * admin service and read it back through the real {@code validate} path, so a cap assertion cannot pass
 * on a hardcoded default (the exception is the absent-row case, whose whole point is to write none).
 * The knowledge base is the real DDInter excerpt parsed by the real source; its 16 drugs are
 * exactly the 16 the question below names, and they carry <b>72</b> above-floor pairs (23 Major,
 * 40 Moderate, 9 Minor) — enough to outrun every cap tested here.
