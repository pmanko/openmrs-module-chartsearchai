/**
 * A bounded pairwise interaction list says it is bounded (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/336">#336</a>).
 *
 * <p>Before this, a screen that hit {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.maxPairChips} truncated its
 * result and stated the fact only to a server-side WARN. Measured on the 3.7.1 standalone against
 * the bundled DDInter knowledge base: a patient on eight anti-inflammatories screened 18 above-floor
 * pairs, reported 10, and every field of the {@code /search} response — the answer, the chips, each
 * reference's {@code withheldInteractions} — was indistinguishable from a complete screen's.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately the same two arrangements {@code PairChipCapContextTest} measures the cap with,
 * so the count a pass STATES and the count it SHOWS cannot drift apart in the suite: the screening
 * arm over six active orders interacting 15 ways, and the 16-drug polypharmacy question with 72
 * above-floor pairs. Context-sensitive for the same reason that class is — the cases write the real
 * global property and read it back through the real {@code validate}.
 *
 * <p><b>What this class pins and what it does not.</b> It pins the counts, through the real
 * {@code validate} over the real DDInter excerpt. It does not pin their transport to the wire; that
 * is {@code LlmInferenceServicePairChipExtentTest} (answer) and
 * {@code ChartSearchAiInteractionPairExtentTest} (response). And {@code getReported()} is asserted
 * against the chips raised only in arrangements whose whole warning list is the arm's own — stated
 * as a precondition in each case, because the drug-in-play arm raises interaction chips for drugs
 * only the ANSWER named and unrated class chips the extent counts nowhere, and those populations
 * are not this one.
 *
 * <p><b>The drug-in-play arm's own cases are at the bottom</b> (issue #356), kept in this class
 * rather than a new one for the reason the paragraph above gives about the two pairwise arms: what
 * one pass STATES about its screen is one question, and three arms answering it in three classes is
 * three chances to answer it differently.
