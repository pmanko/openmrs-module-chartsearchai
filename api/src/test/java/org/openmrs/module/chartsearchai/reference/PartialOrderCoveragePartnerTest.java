/**
 * Issue #186 — {@code DrugSafetyValidator.orderPartners} keyed the class arm's co-medications by
 * ATC CODE, so an order the loaded dataset covers only PARTLY climbed two different rungs of its
 * identity ladder (the covered codes onto the dataset entry, the uncovered ones onto the order) and
 * became two partners. One co-medication, two chips, under two different labels.
 *
 * <p>Documented by issue #182's hardening and reported rather than fixed there, because regrouping
 * is a behaviour change and #182 was carrying a measured impact partition a regrouping would
 * invalidate. It is the partner-side member of the one-substance-one-row family: #171 removed the
 * per-CODE chip on the same arm, and this removes the per-code PARTNER underneath it.
 *
 * <p>The two shapes the fix must not break are pinned here beside the defect, because both are
 * things the per-code ladder gets right and an order-first regrouping could plausibly lose: two
 * orders of one substance staying ONE partner, and a combination order covering two substances
 * staying TWO.
 *
 * <p>Every scenario runs the REAL production path: a curated fixture parsed by the real
 * {@link JsonDrugReferenceSource} — except
 * {@link #everyClassSentenceAboutAPartlyCoveredOrderNamesADrugThatPublishesTheCitedSubgroup} and
 * {@link #aFoldedClassSentenceAboutAPartlyCoveredOrderNamesADrugThatPublishesTheCitedSubgroup},
 * which read the dataset the module SHIPS because the invariant they state is about real fixed-dose
 * products — the real {@code validate} entry point, GP reads on their no-context defaults.
