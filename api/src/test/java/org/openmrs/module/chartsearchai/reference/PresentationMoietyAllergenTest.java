/**
 * An allergy recorded as a PRESENTATION is checked against the parent moiety the KB files it apart
 * from (issue #195) — and only where the KB is NAMED that moiety, so two presentations of one stem
 * are not thereby merged.
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> Where the KB files a presentation as its own substance <em>and</em> gives that
 * row no ATC code, issue #192's correct resolution lands on the presentation, the class comparisons
 * have nothing to compare, and the chip vanishes. Before #192 those cases produced a chip naming the
 * WRONG substance; after, they produce nothing at all — issue #135's ATC-less gap reached through a
 * correct resolution, and the silent-on-a-recorded-allergy failure this whole body of work began with
 * (#86).
 *
 * <p><b>The gate, and why it is the DISPLAY NAME rank.</b> The moiety is taken from the recorded name
 * by removing its trailing qualifier, which is a derivation and not a claim: the recorded string does
 * not assert that {@code insulin lispro} names anything. So only a row that is CALLED the stem may
 * stand for it. A row that merely lists the stem among its aliases is a different presentation, and
 * naming it in a chip would report an allergy to a drug the chart does not record — which is issue
 * #176's defect, arriving from the other side. The dextran rows are where that rank is what decides:
 * relax the gate by one rank and they merge. The two vaccine and the two manganese rows are held apart
 * by less than that — the KB publishes no row named their stem at any rank — and are asserted here as
 * the shape the widening must never reach, not as a test of which rank the gate takes.
 *
 * <p>Every case runs verbatim shipped-KB slices through the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource} parser
 * and the real {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate(String, String, PatientClinicalContext)}. The two
 * cases that assert the fix — the presentation reaching its moiety, and the ATC-less presentation —
 * assert chip TEXT rather than count, because the failure mode is silence and a case passing on "some
 * chip appeared" would prove nothing. The three BOUND cases assert absence, which is all a bound can
 * assert, and they differ in how much they hold: only the dextran pair discriminates the gate's RANK
 * (relax it by one and that case fails). The vaccine, manganese and peanut pairs give no chip at any
 * rank — the KB publishes no row named their stem at all — so they pin the shape the widening must
 * never reach rather than the rank it takes, which each of their comments says.
