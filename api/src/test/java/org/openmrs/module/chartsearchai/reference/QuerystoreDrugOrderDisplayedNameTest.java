/**
 * Contract pin for the measurement issue #347's fix rests on: a {@code drug_order} chart record
 * carries exactly ONE name for the prescription it describes.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it matters here.</b> {@code DrugSafetyValidator.displaysANameOfAny} silences the
 * chart-order bridge clause where the order's own DISPLAYED name reaches the substance a chip names.
 * Until #347 the test was every name the order RECORDS, and
 * {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder.addDrugName} records the order's CONCEPT name beside its
 * drug-row name — so an order displayed {@code Advil 400mg} on concept {@code Ibuprofen} silenced
 * the clause through {@code Ibuprofen}, a name that reaches no prompt text at all. That is only a
 * defect if the concept name really is invisible to the model, which is a claim about ANOTHER
 * module's rendering; so it is asserted here against the output of querystore's REAL
 * {@link DrugOrderRecordSerializer}, driven through its public {@code serialize} entry point on a
 * real {@link DrugOrder} from the standard test dataset. No hand-typed imitation of the format
 * appears here: if querystore starts rendering both names, this test fails and names what broke — at
 * which point #347's shape no longer exists and the silence test can widen back.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does not claim.</b> That the module's own {@code ActiveDrugOrder.getDisplay()} is
 * always the string rendered below. It is wherever the order has a drug row with a non-blank name,
 * which is this fixture's shape and the ticket's. Below that rung they can diverge in more than one
 * way — free text the module can display and querystore never renders, and, on the concept rung, two
 * different concept-name accessors resolved in different contexts — and
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.displaysANameOfAny} records both as residues. Neither is pinned. The
 * last two cases below are why those residues exist rather than being a second rendering rule to
 * mirror.
 *
 * <p>The order is mutated in memory and never saved, exactly as
 * {@link QuerystoreOrderTextMarkerTest} does for the end-marker states.
