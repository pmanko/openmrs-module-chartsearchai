/**
 * Contract pin for the one place the active-order reconciliation reads querystore's rendered prose
 * rather than a structural field: {@link DrugReferenceInjector#describesEndedOrder}, which helps
 * decide whether a {@code drug_order} chart record may substantiate a currently-active order.
 *
 * <p>Since issue #317 it is no longer the only test: the reconciliation AND-s it with the module's
 * own {@code OrderService} read, so a record is admitted only where both leave it live. That does
 * not weaken this pin — prose is still the only evidence for a record the read cannot speak for
 * (one whose order it cannot attribute to the patient, and any record on a chart built when the
 * read failed), so a wording change in querystore still reaches a decision here.
 *
 * <p>Why this test exists. Keying a safety decision on another module's display text is fragile in
 * the worst way — a wording change there would silently reopen issue #118 (a stopped order's record
 * substantiating the live order that replaced it) with every other test still green, because nothing
 * else in this module reads that text. So the markers are asserted against the output of querystore's
 * REAL {@link DrugOrderRecordSerializer}, driven through its public
 * {@code AbstractRecordSerializer.serialize} entry point on a real {@link DrugOrder} from the
 * standard test dataset. No hand-typed imitation of the format appears here: if querystore renames
 * or restructures these markers, this test fails and names what broke.
 *
 * <p>Both directions are pinned. An ended order's text must be RECOGNISED as ended, and an ordinary
 * live order's text must NOT be — the second matters just as much, because over-matching would treat
 * every agreeing chart as drifted and fire the reconciliation's WARN on every query, which is the
 * failure the completeness gate exists to avoid.
 *
 * <p>The order is mutated in memory and never saved: {@code Order.setDateStopped} is not public
 * (core forces {@code OrderService.discontinueOrder}), so the ended states are reached through the
 * public setters {@code setAction} and {@code setAutoExpireDate}, which is enough to exercise the
 * serializer's rendering of them.
