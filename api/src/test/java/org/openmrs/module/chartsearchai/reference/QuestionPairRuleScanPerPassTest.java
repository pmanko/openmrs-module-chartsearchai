/**
 * What the question-pair arm's rule reading COSTS, as a count per pass (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/447">#447</a>).
 *
 * <p>The arm asked "which of subject's above-floor rules name {@code other}?" by scanning subject's
 * whole interaction list, once per ORDERED pair — twice per unordered pair from
 * {@code collectQuestionPairInteraction} and again from {@code pairKeyNames} — so its cost was
 * quadratic in a number the QUESTION chooses, times the rules on each row, the first bounded by
 * nothing but the controller's 1000-character question cap. <b>ADR Decision 104 is the one home for
 * the before/after figures</b>; what belongs here is the shape they have, which is that the walk
 * count tracked the pair loop's own N(N-1) rather than anything the arm does per pair.
 *
 * <p>So this is a COUNT and not a timing — the instrument shape issue #256 already uses for the
 * co-medication resolution ({@code CoMedicationResolutionPerPassTest}), because a wall-clock
 * assertion on a build machine measures the machine. Each entry's interaction list is wrapped,
 * through the public {@link DrugReference#setInteractions}, in a delegate holding the SAME elements
 * in the SAME order and counting the times production asks it for an iterator; the real
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate} then runs over real parsed data.
 *
 * <p><b>Read the counts as INCREMENTS, never as totals.</b> Other arms of the same pass read the
 * same lists — {@code bestRulePerPartner} walks every in-play row's rules — so a total is not this
 * arm's, while what each ADDITIONAL drug in the question costs is.
