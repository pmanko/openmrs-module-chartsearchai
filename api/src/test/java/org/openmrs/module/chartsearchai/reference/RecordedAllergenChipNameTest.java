/**
 * WHICH NAME the allergen arm may call a recorded allergy (issue #268).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> The chip quotes a RECORD — "The patient has a recorded allergy to X." — and
 * used to put in X whichever row of the subject's substance the recorded name resolved to. But
 * {@link DrugReferenceService#findImpliedSubstances} deliberately returns every substance a recorded
 * name IMPLIES (issues #193/#195), and its equal-claimant leg admits a row on a rank TIE, which is
 * satisfied both by a combination the KB spells without a separator — that leg's reason for existing
 * — and by two substances sharing one name that is neither's display name. In the second case the
 * chip asserted an allergy the chart does not record.
 *
 * <p>Both fixtures here are VERBATIM shipped-KB slices read by the real {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource},
 * so the shape is the shipped data's rather than a fixture's invention, and no curated rule exists to
 * fold the identity chip away ({@code DdiDrugReferenceSource} emits no contraindications at all —
 * {@link SelfNamedAllergyRuleRankTest#aDdinterLoadCannotReachThisRankAtAll}).
 *
 * <p><b>The rule.</b> A row may be named as the recorded allergy only where the recorded name NAMES
 * it: it is the unique strongest NAME claimant among the substances in play, or a name the printed
 * label is built from occurs in the recorded string, or a combination constituent of the recorded
 * name resolves to its SUBSTANCE. Where it does, the chip keeps saying "The patient has a recorded
 * allergy to X." Where it does not, that sentence would be false, so the chip states the
 * relationship instead — "X is contraindicated by a recorded allergy to Y" — in the curated rule
 * arm's own shape, which is also what keeps the wire contract that every {@code detail} names its
 * own drug and tells one finding from another.
 *
 * <p>The same rule binds the arm's two CLASS sentences, which say "as the patient's allergy to Y"
 * and so assert the allergy as flatly — only the allergen half of those moves, since they already
 * name their own subject.
 *
 * <p>Each case below names, in its own comment, the clause or sentence it discriminates — mutate
 * that one thing and the case named on it is what reddens.
 * Removing the unique clause altogether also reddens five cases that were already in the suite, Opium
 * under a {@code papaveretum} allergy among them.
