/**
 * The one thing issue #172's constraint must not be "improved" into: a memo of anything derived from
 * {@link DrugReferenceService#getAll()} held in a FIELD of {@link DrugSafetyValidator} rather than in a
 * per-{@code validate} local.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing pinned it.</b> Measured 2026-08-14 on {@code 445554a0}, by moving the recorded-allergen
 * resolution out of {@code validate}'s local and onto the bean, in the two shapes such a memo is
 * actually written in:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>keyed on the allergy tokens</b> — the plausible one, the "optimisation" the rule exists to
 *       refuse — reddened <b>0 of the 1171</b> api tests that existed, and reddens exactly
 *       <b>1 of 1173</b> once this file's two cases do: the one below. Every
 *       other test resolves against one dataset, so nothing else can see the difference;</li>
 *   <li><b>unkeyed</b> reddened three, the two others being
 *       {@code AllergenNameResolutionTest.localizedAllergenSpellingsResolveToTheirDrug} and
 *       {@code .anAllergenIsNotResolvedToADrugNestedInsideItsName}, which happen to reuse one validator
 *       across contexts and so catch a memo that ignores the patient. Neither catches the keyed
 *       form, and neither is about this rule.</li>
 * </ul>
 * So nine comments across three classes told the next author not to do it, and the only shape they
 * would plausibly have done it in was caught by nothing: a decision everyone believed was protected,
 * protected by nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>And the reason those comments gave was false.</b> They said {@code getAll()} is hot-reloadable
 * and that a memoised {@link DrugReference} outliving a reload fails the identity comparisons the
 * contraindication arms make. There is no reload: {@code DrugReferenceService.dataset} is written in
 * {@code ensureLoaded()} when it is null and in the package-private {@code setEntries} test seam, which
 * production never calls; the class's own javadoc has said "held for the life of the bean … requires a
 * module restart" all along. Confirmed live the same day, on the running 3.7.1 standalone: with
 * {@code chartsearchai.drugReference.sourceFormat} flipped from {@code ddinter} to {@code atc} and no
 * restart, {@code GET /chartsearchai/drugreferencestatus} went on reporting {@code ddinter}/2283 and a
 * {@code /search} went on raising its Major chip, where a reload would have re-parsed the DDInter file
 * with the ATC parser, loaded 0 entries and dropped it. The reasons that do hold are enumerated in one
 * place, {@link DrugReferenceService}'s class javadoc, and are not restated here. The one that is
 * specific to THIS memo is: it has no key at all, so a field version would have to key on the patient's
 * own allergy tokens.
 *
 * <p><b>So this case pins one shape of the rule, through the one seam that can replace the entries
 * after a read.</b> {@code setEntries} is that seam. The counterpart below is
 * {@code CrossReactivityGroupsTest#replacedPrefixesAreSeenOnTheNextQuestion_soTheNormalizationIsNeverCachedOnTheInstance}
 * (issue #248), and the analogy is one of SHAPE only: {@code setAtcPrefixes} is public API that Jackson
 * writes through, while {@code setEntries} is package-private with no caller outside tests. Neither
 * staleness is reachable from production today; both cases exist to fix where the memo LIVES. A local
 * cannot outlive the call that made it, so an assertion about the SECOND {@code validate} is the only
 * observation that separates the two.
 *
 * <p>Two things to carry over before copying this arrangement. {@code setEntries} resets THREE things,
 * not one — the entries, the cross-reactivity groups (to empty) and the load status — so a case built
 * on {@code ddiFixtureService} or {@code ddinterServiceWithGroups}, which install groups after seeding,
 * would silently lose them on the second call; here both extra effects are no-ops, because
 * {@code serviceWith} had already pinned the groups empty and nothing reads the status. And the
 * second pass's count of 1 leans on the one-substance-one-chip collapse as well as on memo scope, since
 * {@code DDI_ROUTE_VARIANTS} files {@code Iron} as two rows: a regression in that collapse reddens this
 * case with a message about allergen resolution, so read the detail assertions before believing the
 * name on the tin.
 *
 * <p><b>And here is what it does NOT pin.</b> Worth saying plainly, because a rule defended by more
 * than it has is the failure this case exists to correct. What reddens here is a memo that OUTLIVES the
 * entries it was resolved from. Two shapes stay unpinned. A field REASSIGNED at the
 * top of every pass ({@code this.recordedAllergens = recordedAllergens(context)}, dropping the
 * parameter the list is threaded through) recomputes each time, so this case is green on it — and it is
 * the ordinary tidy-up, since threading the list through two call sites is the only thing keeping it a
 * local. And the first of the reasons in {@link DrugReferenceService}'s class javadoc, one
 * unsynchronized structure shared by concurrent requests, is not exercised at all: this is a
 * single-threaded functional case, and the token-keyed memo it does catch is caught because it goes
 * STALE, never because it is shared. Neither gap is closed by asserting harder here — the first needs a
 * reader of {@code validate}'s shape and the second a concurrency case that would be flaky — so they
 * are recorded rather than papered over.
