/**
 * The MODULE half of the measurement issue #347's fix rests on: {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder}
 * records a name for an active order that the order's own DISPLAY does not carry — the ordered
 * concept's — so an order the chart shows as a brand is reachable by the substance's generic name
 * through {@link PatientClinicalContext.ActiveDrugOrder#getNames()} and through nothing a reader
 * sees.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it is pinned separately.</b> The root cause has two halves and they are facts about two
 * different components. {@code QuerystoreDrugOrderDisplayedNameTest} pins the OTHER half against
 * querystore's real serializer — a {@code drug_order} record renders exactly one name. This one pins
 * that the module's recorded-name set is strictly wider than that, against the real builder, so
 * "{@code recordsANameOfAny} was satisfied by a name no reader could see" is measured at both ends
 * rather than asserted in a javadoc at either. CLAUDE.md: pin the PREMISE, not the conclusion.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does not claim.</b> That the wider set is wrong. It is right for what it is for —
 * {@code resolvesFrom}'s name leg asks which orders a substance was resolved FROM, and an order is
 * this substance's however it was recorded. What #347 changed is the narrower question of whether
 * SAYING so is worth a citable record's budget, and that question is about the one name a reader is
 * shown. {@code DrugSafetyValidator.displaysANameOfAny} is where the two are told apart.
 *
 * <p>Driven through {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder.build} on a real patient of the standard
 * test dataset. The concept is renamed in the database rather than in memory because
 * {@code addConceptName} reads it through {@code Concept.getName()} under the session's own locale
 * resolution, which a detached in-memory edit does not exercise.
