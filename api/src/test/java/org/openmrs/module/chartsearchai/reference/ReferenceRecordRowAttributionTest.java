/**
 * Issues #237 and #259 — the injected {@code drug_reference} record says WHICH ROW of a substance it
 * describes, whenever this response names that substance by another row.
 *
 * <p><b>The defect, one shape reaching two surfaces.</b> {@code DrugReferenceInjector.collect} picks the
 * row a record renders with {@link DrugReference#canonicalRow} alone, while every chip picks it with
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.interactionSubject} — the chart's own claim first
 * ({@link DrugReference#nameMatchStrength}), the fold only among rows tied on that (issues #187, #194,
 * #206). So wherever the patient's chart names a non-canonical row the record and the chips speak of one
 * substance under two names, in one prompt, both citable:
 * <pre>
 * [4] Drug reference — Dexamethasone (ATC …)
 * [5] Safety finding — Dexamethasone (ophthalmic): … interacts with active order phenytoin
 * </pre>
 * Measured 2026-08-14 over the shipped 19 MB KB by driving the real {@code injectRecords} and the real
 * {@code validate}: of its 129 multi-row substances, 104 could be posed with both a record and a chip and
 * <b>all 104 named the substance differently</b>. Re-measure before relying on the figure.
 *
 * <p><b>#259 is that reaching a NUMBER</b>, which is worse than a name: the record renders the canonical
 * row's age band, so a clinician reading the cited record sees a ceiling the warning beside it did not
 * use, with nothing saying so.
 *
 * <p><b>What was decided, and what deliberately was not.</b> Rendering the record from the charted row
 * instead was measured and declined: over the same KB, drawing the patient's partner from the canonical
 * row, a record rendered from the charted row fails to name that partner in <b>74 of 129</b> families
 * (against 0 for the canonical row), because the route-unspecified row is the one carrying the breadth.
 * That trades a naming fix for a coverage loss. So this changes no row's turn to be RENDERED — what it
 * changes is that the record SAYS which row it is, and says it by contrast ("for X, not for Y"), which is
 * the vocabulary issue #244 built and measured for exactly this problem one surface along (see
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.ceilingAttribution}, whose sibling-label guard this shares rather than
 * restates).
 *
 * <p>Every case drives the REAL {@code injectRecords} — and, where a chip is the other half of the claim,
 * the REAL {@code validate} — over fixtures parsed by the real production parsers.
