/**
 * The row-attribution clause AND the other-rows dosing section (issues #237, #259) are <b>NOT</b> gated
 * on the {@code drugSafety.*} switches, and that is deliberately the opposite of what
 * {@link InjectedContraindicationReadingToggleContextTest} pins one section along. The two look alike —
 * both are patient-scoped sentences in a record — so the difference has to be pinned rather than
 * explained, or the next reader "fixes" the inconsistency and silently reopens #259 under a
 * non-default configuration.
 *
 * <p><b>Why they differ.</b> Issue #208's reading ADDS a claim about the patient ("Recorded for this
 * patient: documented ibuprofen allergy"), which is the record's half of a chip — so with the chips off
 * it would be prose with no chip, and it stands down with them. The two sentences watched here do the
 * opposite: they NARROW a claim the record makes anyway. The ceiling, the interaction notes and the
 * drug's own name are rendered whatever the safety switches say; the clause stops them reading as the
 * whole substance's when they are one row's, and the section supplies the sibling ceiling that reading
 * leaves out. Gating a correction on a switch ships the UNCORRECTED sentence whenever the switch is off —
 * which is exactly #259, reachable by configuration.
 *
 * <p>Context-sensitive because the point IS the global property: a contextless case runs with both GPs
 * absent, which fails safe to {@code true}, so it cannot tell a clause that ignores the switch from one
 * that honours it.
 *
 * <p>The arrangement is non-vacuous by construction: the same record carries ALL THREE sentences, so the
 * contraindication reading disappearing is what proves the GP write took effect and that the other two
 * surviving beside it are a real difference rather than a switch that never moved. That is why the
 * fixture's Ceftriaxone pair carries both a contraindication rule and two differing ceilings.
