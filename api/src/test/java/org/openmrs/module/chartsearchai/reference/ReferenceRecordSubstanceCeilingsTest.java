/**
 * Issue #259's NUMERIC half — the injected {@code drug_reference} record states the dosing the
 * substance's other resolved rows publish, so no dose chip can quote a ceiling the citable record does
 * not carry.
 *
 * <p><b>What issue #237's clause left open.</b> That fix made the record say WHICH ROW it describes
 * ({@code DrugReferenceInjector.rowAttribution}), which removes the ambiguity in a NAME. It does not
 * remove a contradiction in a NUMBER: the record still rendered one row's band alone, so a response
 * could carry
 * <pre>
 * [4] Drug reference — Amoxicillin … maximum 3000 mg/day       (the row the record renders)
 * [5] Safety finding — … exceeds the 2000 mg/day maximum       (the row the chart names)
 * </pre>
 * with only the 3000 citable. A clinician reading the cited record still sees a ceiling the warning
 * beside it did not use — which is issue #259 as reported, and the reason it says a number is worse than
 * a name.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the record is the surface that has to move.</b> The chip arm already reads the whole
 * substance: {@code DrugSafetyValidator.addOverdose} tries the subject row's band and then EVERY sibling
 * row's, and {@code anyActionableBand} lets it act when the rendered row publishes no band at all. The
 * record read exactly one of those rows. That asymmetry is the defect — not which row either surface
 * prefers — so the fix is to give the record the same row set the chips fold, and no row's turn to be
 * RENDERED changes (issue #237 measured and declined that: the route-unspecified row carries the
 * breadth, and rendering the charted one loses the patient's own interaction partner in 74 of the
 * shipped KB's 129 multi-row families).
 *
 * <p><b>The guard is deliberately NOT {@code worthNamingApart}</b>, which the attribution clause shares
 * with {@code DrugSafetyValidator.ceilingAttribution} — see
 * {@link #twoRowsPublishingOneNameStillStateTheirOwnCeilings}. That guard answers "would CONTRASTING
 * these two rows say anything", and "for X, not for X" is a contradiction. This section ENUMERATES, and
 * an item under a name the record already uses still says something a reader can act on: a different
 * number. Asking one question with the other's predicate is the conflation CLAUDE.md's ATC bullet exists
 * to forbid, one feature along.
 *
 * <p><b>Reachability.</b> {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource} sets no {@code ageBands} at all, so no ddinter
 * file — the shipped 19 MB KB included — can reach any of this; and every bundled curated substance is
 * one row ({@link #noBundledCuratedDatasetCanReachTheSectionAtAll}). It is reachable for a deployment
 * authoring per-presentation dosing, which is the normal reason to author a curated file, and nothing
 * tested it before this file.
 *
 * <p>Every case drives the REAL {@code injectRecords} — and, where a chip is the other half of the
 * claim, the REAL {@code validate} — over fixtures parsed by the real production parsers.

		//
		// Why this needs a pair of its own rather than the Amoxicillin one. Dose attribution is
		// CLAUSE-scoped and alias-anchored, and the record's own dosing sentence carries no drug name — so
		// a recited "maximum 3000 mg/day" is attributed to nobody whatever the cue does. The section's item
		// is the first record text that puts a NAME and a ceiling in one clause, and it always pairs a row
		// with its OWN ceiling, so the parsed figure can only exceed something when the SUBJECT row is a
		// different row publishing a STRICTER one. Nitrofurantoin is the only pair here shaped that way
		// (route-unspecified 100, modified-release 200); on every other pair the arithmetic acquits the
		// text and the cue is never load-bearing, which is why mutating LIMIT_CUE left this file green
		// until this case existed.
