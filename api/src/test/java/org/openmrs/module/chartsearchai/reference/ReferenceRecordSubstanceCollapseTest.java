/**
 * One injected {@code drug_reference} record per substance, not one per reference row (issue #163).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> {@code DrugReferenceInjector.matchingEntries} de-duplicated on
 * {@code ref.getId()}, and route variants of one substance deliberately carry DISTINCT ids — the
 * parser falls back to the DDInter id when the RxCUI is shared, precisely so citations stay
 * unambiguous. So a question about one drug injected one near-duplicate record per variant, each
 * rendering up to {@code MAX_INTERACTION_RENDER_CHARS} of interaction prose.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it matters, and why it is invisible from outside.</b> This is prompt budget: several
 * thousand characters of near-duplicate reference text crowd out chart records the answer needs
 * (issues #95, #99), and handing the model several differently-worded copies of one fact is the setup
 * for the miscopying #142 records. The REST response returns only CITED references, so the cost is
 * only visible in what gets injected — which is why these cases measure the injected slice itself
 * ({@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.injectedReferences}) rather than inferring it from chip counts.
 *
 * <p>Driven through the real {@link DrugReferenceInjector#injectRecords} over verbatim KB slices.
