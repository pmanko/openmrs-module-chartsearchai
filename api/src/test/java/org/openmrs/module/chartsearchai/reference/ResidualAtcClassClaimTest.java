/**
 * Whether a RESIDUAL ATC subgroup may license a clinical relationship claim (issue #167), in both
 * arms that make one.
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> A shared level-4 subgroup was read as evidence of a pharmacological
 * relationship whatever the subgroup was. Measured live on the 3.7.1 standalone, in both arms:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>interaction arm — Agnes Adams on Aspirin 81mg, "Is it safe to give epinephrine?" →
 *       {@code Epinephrine is in the same ATC class (A01AD) as active order Acetylsalicylic acid
 *       (aspirin) — possible duplicate therapy}. {@code A01AD} is "Other agents for local oral
 *       treatment": aspirin is filed there as a mouth rinse and epinephrine as a dental
 *       haemostatic, and adrenaline and aspirin are not duplicate therapy.</li>
 *   <li>contraindication arm — {@code Potassium Iodide} and {@code Acetylcysteine} share only
 *       {@code S01XA} "Other ophthalmologicals" and {@code V03AB} "Antidotes", and the chip read
 *       {@code is in the same ATC class (V03AB) … — possible cross-reactivity}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>And the case that bounds the exclusion</b>, which is why "no residual bucket may ever
 * license a claim" is the wrong answer. A residual subgroup inherits whatever its containing group
 * asserts: {@code R06AX} is "Other antihistamines for systemic use", but its parent {@code R06A} is
 * "ANTIHISTAMINES FOR SYSTEMIC USE", so loratadine and desloratadine really are both antihistamines
 * and one really is duplicate therapy for the other. The last case here pins that chip, and it
 * passes before this issue's change as well as after — deliberately, because the risk in fixing
 * #167 is over-vetoing, not under-vetoing. See {@code DrugReference.isUnclassifyingAtcCode} for the
 * criterion and its measured KB impact, and {@code CrossReactivityClassChoiceTest}, whose
 * {@code J01GB} case ("Other aminoglycosides") is the same boundary in the allergy arm.
 *
 * <p>Driven through the real {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate} entry point over rows the real
 * {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource} parses out of a verbatim slice of the shipped 19 MB KB.
