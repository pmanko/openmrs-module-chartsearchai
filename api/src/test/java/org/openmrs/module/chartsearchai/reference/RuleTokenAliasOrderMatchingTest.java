/**
 * Matching an interaction rule's token against a drug the patient is on, when the chart names that
 * drug something the rule does not (issue #136).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> {@link PatientClinicalContext#hasActiveDrug} only ever saw the rule's own
 * single match token, so a drug ordered under a name the reference data carries as an ALIAS rather
 * than as the token had no interaction coverage at all. The load-bearing case is aspirin under its
 * chemical name: every DDInter rule about it carries the token {@code aspirin} — the parser writes
 * each rule's token from the partner row's {@code rxnorm_name} — while the row's own {@code name} is
 * {@code Acetylsalicylic acid}, which is also a real drug-concept name in the 3.7.1 demo dictionary
 * and does not contain the string {@code aspirin}. Before issue #128 that order matched the token
 * {@code salicylic acid} — the WRONG drug, inheriting an unrelated entry's rules; after it, nothing.
 * A Major warfarin-versus-aspirin bleeding interaction was silently absent.
 *
 * <p><b>The fix, and the shape it must not take.</b> The entry's names are consulted by resolving the
 * patient's orders to their reference entries and asking whether the rule's token IS one of those
 * entries' own names — {@link DrugReference#isNamed}, the same exact-identity test
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.identifies} already uses on the reference side. It is deliberately NOT a
 * boundary scan of the token against those names: an entry's alias list carries COMBINATION-PRODUCT
 * names ({@code salicylic acid / urea} is an alias of the Urea entry as well as the Salicylic acid
 * one), and a scan would let a urea order inherit salicylic acid's rules — a drug the patient is on
 * in no form, which is issue #86's defect arriving by a new route. The third case below is that
 * hazard, and it fails on a scanning implementation while every other case here passes.
 *
 * <p><b>Both directions, measured 2026-08-05</b> over the 3.7.1 demo dictionary's 2533 drug and
 * drug-concept names against the full 19MB KB (2093 distinct rule tokens, 5169 distinct aliases):
 * matching pairs go from <b>907 to 1001 — 94 added, 0 removed</b>, over 77 distinct order names and
 * 27 distinct rule tokens. Every added pair was enumerated and classified by token: in all 94 the
 * patient IS on the drug the matched entry describes, so none is a fabricated drug. In <b>81</b> the
 * token is that drug under another vocabulary ({@code rifampin}/{@code Rifampicin},
 * {@code albuterol}/{@code Salbutamol}, {@code torsemide}/{@code Torasemide}, and the vaccine
 * antigens). In the remaining <b>13</b> the token names a DIFFERENT substance from the entry's own
 * name, so the chip's partner label is wrong while its finding is right: 9 because DDInter's
 * {@code rxnorm_name} for that row is a mis-normalisation ({@code Chlorpheniramine}/{@code chlorine}
 * ×3, {@code Sulfamethoxazole}/{@code sulfamethazine} ×6) and 4 because it is a close congener
 * ({@code Omeprazole}/{@code esomeprazole} ×2, {@code Isosorbide}/{@code isosorbide mononitrate} ×2).
 * That mislabel is the dataset's, is the class {@link DrugReference#displayLabel} exists for, and
 * already reached any patient whose order name happened to carry the {@code rxnorm_name} spelling.
 * The whole #86/#128/#129 kill set was re-scored through this arm and through the allergen resolver:
 * 0 of 21 nesting pairs leak.
 *
 * <p>One consequence of the widening is pinned elsewhere rather than duplicated here: matching every
 * name of a drug means two rules whose tokens are two names of the SAME partner both match, so
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.bestRulePerPartner} had to start grouping on the partner ENTRY instead of
 * on the rule's label. {@code DrugSafetyQuestionPairInteractionTest
 * .aPairAlsoJoinedByARuleNamingAnActiveOrderStaysWithTheActiveOrderArm} already owns that fixture — a
 * {@code coumadin} row and a {@code warfarin} row against one {@code Warfarin 5mg} order — and it
 * failed on this change until the grouping moved, which is what makes it the pin.
 *
 * <p>Every case runs the real pipeline — a verbatim KB slice through the real
 * {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}, then the real
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate(String, String, PatientClinicalContext)} or the real
 * {@link DrugReferenceInjector#injectRecords} — with GP reads on their no-context defaults (severity
 * floor {@code minor}).
