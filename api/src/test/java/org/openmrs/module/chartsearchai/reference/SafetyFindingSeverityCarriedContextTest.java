/**
 * Issue #337, round three: the rating an injected {@code safety_finding} states travels beside the
 * record as well as inside its prose, so a consumer asking "which rating did this finding state"
 * has one answer rather than one per parse.
 *
 * <p>What this file pins is the WRITE, through the real
 * {@code DrugReferenceInjector.injectRecords} over the pinned DDInter excerpt — which rating reaches
 * {@link RecordMapping#getFindingSeverity()} and which is deliberately withheld. What the ANSWER
 * check does with it is {@code SafetyFindingSeverityFidelityTest}'s.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a context.</b> One of the two withheld cases is {@code unknown}, and the shipped floor
 * ({@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.minInteractionSeverity} = {@code minor}) filters an
 * Unknown-rated row out of the findings entirely. It becomes reachable exactly where that property's
 * own documentation points an operator — lowering the floor to audit what the knowledge base holds —
 * so the carve-out has to be pinned under that configuration rather than assumed from the rated
 * cases beside it. The neighbouring {@link UnknownSeverityFindingStrengthContextTest} reaches the
 * same rating for a different question, and the two are not substitutes: that one asserts the
 * STRENGTH clause an Unknown finding renders, this one asserts that no rating is carried for it.
