/**
 * Issue #174 site 3 — the interaction SCREENING arm
 * ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.addActiveOrderPairInteractions}, issue #113) named its subject after
 * whichever row {@link DrugReferenceService#findForActiveOrders} returned first, so a substance the
 * KB files as several rows was named by a route-qualified row for a systemic order.
 *
 * <p>Label-only: the arm's own unordered pair key already collapses the duplicate chips, and issue
 * #173's identity ledger already stops the drug-in-play arm and this one both reporting one pair.
 * What was left is that the two arms could still CALL one substance two different things in one
 * build — live-confirmed on a deployment where the same patient's chip read {@code Salicylic acid}
 * for a question naming the drug and {@code Salicylic acid (sodium)} for a screening question.
 *
 * <p>Seven of the shipped KB's multi-row families name their route-unspecified row somewhere other
 * than first, which is what makes the choice observable at all; {@code Chloroprocaine} is one of
 * them, and the fixture below is a verbatim slice of it.
 *
 * <p>Every scenario runs the REAL production path: a verbatim DDInter KB slice parsed by the real
 * {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}, the real {@code validate} entry point, real question strings, GP
 * reads on their no-context defaults.
