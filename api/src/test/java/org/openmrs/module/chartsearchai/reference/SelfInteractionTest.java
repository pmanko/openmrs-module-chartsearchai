/**
 * No drug is reported as interacting with itself (issue #152).
 *
 * <p>The shipped DDInter 2.0 knowledge base carries one row pairing a drug with ITSELF —
 * {@code DDInter225}, botulinum toxin type A, 1 of 295,184 — plus further rows pairing two ROUTE
 * VARIANTS of one substance with each other. The total the guard drops is not restated here because
 * it moves whenever substance identity widens: it was 26 when issue #152 shipped and 28 after issue
 * #164 resolved two more pairs to one substance by registry id. The parser logs the live count in a
 * WARN at load, which is the figure to read. The
 * parser loaded both kinds, so a substance could be raised as interacting with itself: a chip reading
 * "Lidocaine interacts with active order lidocaine", and the same partner listed inside the drug's own
 * injected reference record.
 *
 * <p>The route-variant kind is not a cosmetic duplicate either, and it is why the guard is at the
 * SUBSTANCE level rather than on the row id alone. Every variant of a substance publishes the same
 * {@code rxnorm_name}, which is the token its rules match on and the label a chip prints, so such a
 * pair can only ever render as a substance interacting with itself — the clinical content the KB row
 * carries (concurrent systemic and topical exposure) is not expressible by anything this layer prints.
 *
 * <p>Guarded at load rather than per arm, because the interaction rows feed five consumers — the
 * drug-in-play chips, the screening arm, the question-pair arm, the promoted notes in the injected
 * reference record and the pre-answer finding derived from a chip — and one invariant at the parse
 * boundary covers all of them, and a future KB revision too.
 *
 * <p>A third shape is latent rather than shipped, and it is the only one the guard's ID leg can catch:
 * a row publishing no {@code rxnorm_name} paired with itself. 28 rows publish none and 0 of them carry
 * such a pair, so the leg cannot be exercised by any verbatim slice — the last three cases below use the
 * one fixture that authors that row, and say so.
 *
 * <p>Slices taken verbatim from the shipped KB — apart from that one authored row, which its fixture's
 * {@code metadata.note} identifies — through the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource} parser and the real
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate(String, String, PatientClinicalContext)}.
