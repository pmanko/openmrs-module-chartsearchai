/**
 * One recorded allergy is ONE chip, whichever of the two contraindication arms can see it (issue
 * #146).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> On {@code sourceFormat=json} — the shipped default when this was filed, and
 * since ADR Decision 36 the format selected for dosing — an allergy to a
 * drug the curated file also carries a self-named allergy rule for produced two chips for one fact:
 * <pre>
 * Ibuprofen is contraindicated by an active allergy: documented ibuprofen allergy
 * The patient has a recorded allergy to Ibuprofen.
 * </pre>
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator}'s curated arm walked the entry's {@code contraindications} and fired on
 * {@code {"type":"allergy","token":"ibuprofen"}}; the allergen arm resolved the same allergy to the
 * same entry and fired the identity chip. The two used different ledger keys and so could not see
 * each other. {@link #theShippedCuratedFileCarriesThatShapeOnThreeOfItsFourEntries} measures how much
 * of the shipped file has it, through production predicates rather than by reading the file.
 *
 * <p><b>The fix, and what it keys on.</b> A curated ALLERGY rule whose token names the very entry it
 * is filed against reports the allergen arm's fact, so it is keyed the way that arm keys it — on the
 * subject's own substance — and the two collapse in {@code ContraindicationChips}, the ledger that
 * already collapses issue #145's route variants. It is the FACT that is keyed, never "both arms
 * fired": a rule naming something else (a class token like {@code nsaid}, or another substance) keeps
 * its own chip beside the folded one, which
 * {@link #aClassLevelRuleKeepsItsOwnChipBesideTheFoldedOne} pins.
 *
 * <p><b>Which chip survives is decided by CONTENT</b>, not by a fixed arm-yields-to-arm precedence —
 * issue #88's lesson, that the yielding arm can be the one carrying something. The curated rule
 * carries an operator-authored note the identity sentence cannot reproduce, so it outranks identity
 * while it has one AND while the allergy record it matched NAMES that drug (issue #223 — bare
 * containment can reach a record about something else entirely, and a rule standing on that must not
 * speak in the identity chip's place; see {@link SelfNamedAllergyRuleRankTest}); with a blank note it
 * renders its own token back
 * ({@code ChartSearchAiUtils.firstNonBlank}) and says strictly less than the identity sentence, so it
 * ranks below and the identity wording survives instead.
 *
 * <p>Every case drives the real {@code validate} (and, for the prompt half, the real injector wired to
 * the real validator) over a dataset parsed by the real production parser. Nothing here calls an
 * internal or hand-builds a {@link DrugReference}.
