/**
 * One mechanism, several partners: the finding is stated ONCE and names every active order it covers.
 *
 * <p><b>The measurement.</b> On the 3.7.1 standalone (patient Sarah Taylor, 2026-09-14) "Is aspirin
 * safe for her?" returned nine interaction chips carrying 5,717 characters of detail, of which 3,324
 * — 58% — were re-sent copies: four distinct mechanism texts, the corticosteroid one repeated five
 * times byte for byte and the NSAID one twice. The only thing that varied across those five was the
 * partner's name.
 *
 * <p><b>Not {@code StatedInteractionChips}, which answers a different question.</b> That collapse is
 * for a chip whose whole SENTENCE another chip already said — two rules about one prescription. Here
 * the sentences differ, because the partners differ; what repeats is the mechanism they share.
 *
 * <p><b>The pair count does not follow the chip count.</b> {@code PairChipExtent} counts above-floor
 * rule PAIRS, and the arm's return value feeds it, so collapsing chips must leave it untouched —
 * stated as its own case below because it is the one thing here that fails silently.
