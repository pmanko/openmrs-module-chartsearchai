/**
 * What the shipped knowledge base's alias vocabulary is SHAPED like, measured through the real parser
 * and the real accessor — the figure ADR Decision 68 quotes when it declines to harvest a dictionary's
 * every synonym into that vocabulary (issue #353).
 *
 * <p><b>Why a test and not a script.</b> {@code CLAUDE.md} forbids re-expressing a production predicate
 * in a script that measures the knowledge base for a figure that will be quoted: this one would have to
 * reimplement {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource.DrugRow.addAlias}'s trim, lower-case and de-duplication,
 * plus {@code DrugReference.setAliases}' own trim and {@code DrugReferenceValidity}'s blank-alias drop
 * and its repair of an entry no alias names. A first pass of this measurement was written as a script
 * and disagreed with an independent read in exactly the tail being investigated, which is the failure
 * that rule records. Every figure asserted below is produced by {@link DrugReference#getAliases()} over
 * {@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.shippedEntries()}, which is the real
 * {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource#load()}.
 *
 * <p><b>What the figures are OF, and what makes them safe to pin.</b> They are properties of the
 * dataset this module SHIPS, so they move when that dataset is refreshed and are meant to — a refresh
 * that changes them is a change to the argument Decision 68 rests on and should be read, not silently
 * absorbed. That is why the short vocabulary is asserted as the LIST rather than as a count: a count
 * going from 7 to 8 says nothing, while a new member says which word joined and whether it is still a
 * substance name.
