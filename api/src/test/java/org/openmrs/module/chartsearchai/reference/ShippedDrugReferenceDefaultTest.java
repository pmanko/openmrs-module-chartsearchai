/**
 * What an install that enables the feature and configures NOTHING ELSE actually gets. Every other
 * test in this package arranges its own dataset; this one asserts the shipped default, which no
 * arrangement can observe and which is the only dataset most deployments will ever run.
 *
 * <p>It is the full DDInter 2.0 knowledge base, bundled in the omod — not the 16-drug excerpt that
 * used to be bundled, and no longer the four-drug curated seed. Both halves are asserted, because
 * either one alone passes for the wrong reason: the FORMAT alone would pass with an excerpt in the
 * jar, and the SIZE alone would pass on an operator's file. The floors are floors and not equalities
 * so a knowledge-base refresh does not have to edit this test; they are set where only the whole
 * knowledge base can meet them (it ships 2283 entries and 590,312 interaction links, against the
 * excerpt's 16 and 240).
 *
 * <p><b>The dosing bound is pinned here too, and deliberately.</b> DDInter publishes drug-drug
 * interactions only, so the shipped default carries no age band and no hand-authored
 * allergy/condition rule: {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.warnOnDoseExcess} defaults to true and,
 * under this dataset, has nothing it can ever fire on. That is the trade the default makes — 5
 * hand-authored interaction rules over 4 drugs, exchanged for ~295k rated pairs over 2283 — and it
 * is asserted rather than left to be discovered, because a safety arm that cannot fire looks
 * exactly like one that found nothing. An install that needs dose ceilings selects
 * {@code sourceFormat=json} or points {@code dataFilePath} at a dataset carrying them.
