/**
 * A listed test fixture that calls itself a verbatim slice of the shipped knowledge base still is one.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a case rather than trust.</b> The cases that read such a slice build their answers out of
 * the record the injector renders from it and compare them against that same record, so they are
 * self-relative: edit a row and they stay green while the record they were written about no longer
 * exists. That matters because a decision can quote the rendered record — ADR Decision 59 quotes the
 * one this file's slice produces, character for character — so an edit here can make a published
 * measurement false on a green build. Measured: editing a row's {@code rxcui} leaves every case in
 * {@code ReferenceProseFidelityTest} green, because it changes nothing the injector renders. Some
 * edits those cases DO catch — an ATC code, because it changes the sentence they are built around —
 * which is why the claim is about the file being a slice and not about the cases being blind.
 *
 * <p><b>Whole rows, not projections.</b> An earlier version of this compared four accessors and let
 * seven kinds of edit through — {@code rxcui}, {@code drugbank_id}, a {@code ciel} entry, the
 * interaction row's severity, the interaction array emptied, a fabricated mechanism text, and the
 * metadata note rewritten to say the file is hand-authored. It compares the JSON now: every field of
 * every row, the interaction rows falling wholly inside it, and the mechanism entries those
 * reference — six of those seven. The seventh is the metadata note, which stays uncompared
 * deliberately: it is prose about the slice rather than data from it, so a note rewritten to say the
 * file is hand-authored still passes, and only its presence is checked.
 *
 * <p>It reads the shipped file directly rather than through {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource}, because
 * the question is whether the BYTES were copied and a parse is exactly what would hide an edit the
 * parser normalises away. It is not the parsed-entry accessors' rule either: {@code getId()} and
 * {@code substanceKey()} are resolved per substance-name FAMILY over the whole dataset
 * ({@code DdiDrugReferenceSource.substanceIds} is canonical), so a slice and the 2283-row file
 * legitimately disagree about them and asserting one would fail on a faithful slice.
