/**
 * One production source file, read as TEXT with its comments and string literals blanked, for the
 * guards that pin a rule nothing behavioural can see.
 *
 * <p>Extracted at the THIRD class to need the walk, which is the threshold {@link ModuleSourceRoot}'s
 * own javadoc records for itself. {@code ChipSubjectOneResolutionTest} and
 * {@code OrderPartnerNameSourceWritePathTest} carry the other two copies and are deliberately NOT
 * migrated here: they are outside the change that extracted this, so the drift they can still make is
 * theirs rather than this class's. What that leaves is real and worth naming — the two copies have
 * already diverged in their block-comment tail handling — but migrating them is a change of its own,
 * and the second of them keeps its file locator apart from {@code ModuleSourceRoot} for a reason its
 * own javadoc states.
 *
 * <p><b>Every lookup fails LOUDLY rather than answering "not found".</b> A needle that matches nothing
 * leaves a guard forbidding nothing, and one that matches twice cannot say which body it delimited —
 * so both are assertion failures here rather than a best guess returned to the caller. The read
 * asserts the file exists and is not truncated for the same reason: a guard that reads nothing
 * satisfies every "is not called here" assertion by containing nothing.
