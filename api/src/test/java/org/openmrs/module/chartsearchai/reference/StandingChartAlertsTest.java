/**
 * The standing surface: "is this patient prescribed something her own chart contraindicates?", asked
 * of the chart rather than of a response (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/280">#280</a>).
 *
 * <p><b>What it is for.</b> Issue #143's active-order contraindication arm ran on every question, and
 * that was withdrawn — ADR Decision 79 carries the measurement. The arm is now bounded by
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.SubjectMatter}, and what that gives up is stated in the reversal it produced,
 * {@code ActiveOrderContraindicationTest.aPrescribedAllergyIsNotRaisedWhereTheResponseIsAboutSomethingElse}:
 * a clinician who never asks a drug-shaped question is no longer told that the patient is actively
 * prescribed the drug she is recorded as allergic to. This class covers the surface that gives it back
 * — one a client ASKS for, so nothing rides an unrelated answer.
 *
 * <p><b>The mechanism, and why the fix is one gate rather than a second arm.</b> On a pass with no
 * question and no answer every other arm is silent by its OWN anchor, not by anything this change
 * added: {@code findByQuery} answers an empty list for a null question, so the drug-in-play, dose and
 * interaction arms never enter their loop over the in-play set; {@code addQuestionPairInteractions}
 * requires two question drugs; and the screening arm requires
 * {@code QueryScopeRouter.isInteractionScreening} of a null question, which is false. So
 * {@code addActiveOrderContraindications} is the only arm such a pass can reach, and the only thing
 * withholding its findings is {@code SubjectMatter}, which on a surface that is not a response has no
 * referent to answer about. {@link #theStandingSurfaceReportsNoInteractionsEvenBetweenInteractingActiveOrders}
 * is what keeps that composite true rather than leaving it to this paragraph.
 *
 * <p>Every case drives the real validator over a real parsed dataset through
 * {@link DrugReferenceTestSupport}, with no mock and no reimplementation. The seam is
 * {@code standingChartAlerts(PatientClinicalContext)}, which is where {@code validate}'s own
 * package-private seam sits and what every contextless case in
 * {@code ActiveOrderContraindicationTest} already drives; the two GPs above it are covered by
 * {@link #theStandingEntryGatesOnTheSharedTogglePredicate} and by
 * {@code StandingChartAlertsToggleContextTest}, which needs a real {@code Context} and so cannot live
 * here.
 *
 * <p><b>What no case here reaches, named rather than left to be discovered.</b> Nothing produces an
 * ALERT through the public {@code standingChartAlerts(Patient)} path end to end — that would need a
 * context-sensitive patient carrying both a real drug order and a real allergy the bundled dataset
 * relates, and the toggle class's public-entry case runs that path on the standard test patient, who
 * is prescribed nothing this dataset contraindicates, so it asserts the VERDICT and not a finding.
 * The fail-safe {@code catch} in that method is executed by nothing HERE — that is
 * {@code StandingChartAlertsToggleContextTest.aPassThatThrowsReportsTheChartAsNotScreenedRatherThanAsClean},
 * which fails the dataset read the pass makes. And every chart here passes a
 * flattened name set with no per-order {@code ActiveDrugOrder} list, which production always builds
 * (issues #118, #290) — so the surface is measured over the shape the arm falls back to rather than
 * the one it usually gets.

	 * {@code contraindicationRecordsRead} is lost silently and fail-OPEN, the shorter constructors

	 * {@code activeDrugOrdersRead} had no enriched-context reader, and pinning the copy before one
	 * arrived is what makes that arrival cheap. This module's own instructions record the identical

	 *
	 * <p><b>The fixture is what makes it discriminating, and the obvious one is not.</b>

	 * outright. It needs orders the dataset resolves AND a failed record read, which is
	 * {@code unreadableRecordsCtxWithOrders} and is a real shape: the builder reads orders and
	 * allergies in separate try blocks.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Both stamps, and the second was once called unreachable here.</b> That claim — that an
	 * order read which threw leaves no orders and so no reference names, so the copy is never taken
	 * with that stamp false — was falsified by running the real builder: its order loop sits inside ONE
	 * {@code try}, so a throw partway through leaves the orders already collected in place and the
	 * stamp false. {@code partiallyReadOrdersCtx} is that shape.
	 *
	 * <p>Driven through the real enrichment the real pass performs — {@code findForActiveOrders} then
