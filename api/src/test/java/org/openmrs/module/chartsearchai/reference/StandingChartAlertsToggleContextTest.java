/**
 * {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.warnOnContraindications} silences the standing surface (issue #280)
 * exactly as it silences the answer one — the flag is read in the one place both passes go through.
 *
 * <p>Context-sensitive because the point IS the global property: each case writes a real GP through
 * the admin service and reads it back through the real {@code standingChartAlerts} path, so neither
 * can pass on the hardcoded default. Every case in {@link StandingChartAlertsTest} runs with the GP
 * absent, which fails safe to {@code true}, so none of them can tell a surface that honours the
 * operator's switch from one that ignores it.
 *
 * <p>Both directions, because a 0-alert assertion under a disabled flag proves nothing unless the same
 * arrangement provably alerts when it is enabled — the reason
 * {@code ContraindicationToggleContextTest}, whose shape this follows, states its own pair.
 *
 * <p>The two GPs ABOVE this seam ({@code chartsearchai.drugReference.enabled} and
 * {@code chartsearchai.drugSafety.validateAnswers}) are not reachable from here: they gate the
 * {@code Patient}-taking entry, whose chart read needs a patient with a real allergy and a real active
 * order — but that entry gates on nothing but {@code reportsStandingChartAlerts()}, which
 * {@link #theScreenedStatementIsFalseWhereverASwitchThatSilencesTheSurfaceIsOff} measures here, one
 * switch at a time. {@code StandingChartAlertsTest.theStandingEntryGatesOnTheSharedTogglePredicate}
 * pins the other half: that the entry consults that predicate and spells no switch of its own.
