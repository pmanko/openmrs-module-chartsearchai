/**
 * The active-order contraindication arm is scoped to what the RESPONSE IS ABOUT.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> chartsearchai is a question-answering module — its README opens "lets
 * clinicians ask natural language questions about a patient's chart and get answers with source
 * citations" — and {@link DrugSafetyValidator}'s own contract is a check that "runs after the answer
 * is generated and <em>annotates</em> it". Issue #143 widened one arm past that contract: it walked
 * every active order against every recorded allergy and condition <em>whatever the question and the
 * answer named</em>, so the identical chips rode every response. Measured live on the 3.7.1
 * standalone against patient {@code a7090f70}: "any allergies?", "are there any drug interactions
 * with her current medications?", "does she have cancer?" and "what is her date of birth?" all
 * returned the same two contraindication chips, byte for byte. An alert with no acknowledgement
 * state, repeated on a channel that only opens when someone asks something else, is the shape that
 * trains a clinician to stop reading it.
 *
 * <p><b>What replaces it.</b> A chip is raised when either side of it is in the response's subject
 * matter — the question, the answer, or a record the answer cited. Both sides count because a
 * contraindication relates two things and either can be what was asked about: the DRUG side keeps
 * the case issue #143 was really built for (a prescribed drug named only by a cited
 * {@code drug_order} record, which issue #105's echo rule removes from the in-play set), and the
 * FINDING side keeps a chip whose drug is never mentioned but whose allergy or condition is what the
 * response is about. A question in the medication, allergy or condition domain widens its own side
 * wholesale, because there the patient's list IS the topic even when no individual name is written
 * out.
 *
 * <p><b>What this deliberately gives up</b>, recorded so it is not rediscovered as a bug: a
 * prescribing error nobody ever asks a drug-shaped question about is no longer announced. That is
 * not a safety net this module can honestly carry — it has no subscription, no acknowledgement and
 * no delivery path that opens unprompted — and since issue #280 the finding is served by a surface
 * that does not need them, {@code GET /chartsearchai/chartalerts}, which a client ASKS for rather
 * than one that opens on its own ({@link StandingChartAlertsTest}). Acknowledgement state is still
 * elsewhere (order entry, a chart banner, CDS hooks). See the rewritten case in
 * {@link ActiveOrderContraindicationTest}, which is where this reverses a documented decision.
 *
 * <p>Every case drives the real {@code DrugSafetyValidator.validate} with real querystore-shaped chart
 * records, over the real bundled curated dataset ({@code sourceFormat=json}, whose ibuprofen entry
 * carries both an identity-resolvable name and curated allergy and condition rules) — except the two
 * CROSS-REACTIVITY cases ({@link #anAllergyTheResponseCitesReachesADrugItCrossReactsWith} and its
 * control), which need the DDInter excerpt plus the curated cross-reactivity groups
 * ({@link #nsaidValidator()}) because the curated four carry no two entries the data relates, and only
 * where the allergen and the order are DIFFERENT substances does the finding side run on its own — with
 * one substance the drug side is satisfied by the same words and the leg never executes.
