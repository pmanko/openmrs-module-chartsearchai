/**
 * Which SUBSTANCES a recorded string puts in play — issue #209.
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> Two name-resolution rules were in force and disagreed about how many
 * substances one name denotes. The ranked one ({@link DrugReference#nameMatchStrength},
 * {@link DrugReferenceService#findImpliedSubstances}) keeps the strongest claimants; the unranked
 * boolean matchers ({@link DrugReference#matchesText} for prose,
 * {@link DrugReference#matchesDrugName} for a recorded name) admit EVERY candidate. Where a chip arm
 * built its candidate set by iterating a boolean, a name admitted a superset and a chip named a
 * substance nobody had named and the patient was not on.
 *
 * <p>Sarah Taylor's live shape on the 3.7.1 standalone, reproduced here row-for-row: one
 * {@code Hydrocortisone Injection vial 100mg} order, a recorded dexamethasone allergy, and a chip
 * reading "Hydrocortisone butyrate is in the same ATC class (H02AB) as the patient's allergy to
 * Dexamethasone". The ester carries {@code hydrocortisone} as an alias (its DDInter
 * {@code rxnorm_name}) and is a DIFFERENT substance — measured through the production predicates over
 * the shipped 19 MB KB, {@code matchesText("hydrocortisone")} is true for all four hydrocortisone rows
 * while {@code nameMatchStrength("hydrocortisone")} scores {@code Hydrocortisone} 2 and
 * {@code Hydrocortisone butyrate} 1.
 *
 * <p><b>Both legs, or the chip comes back from the other arm.</b> The same substance reached the same
 * chip by two routes — the question's prose ({@code findByQuery}) and the patient's own order name
 * ({@code findByDrugName}) — and the two arms skip whatever the other already covered, so narrowing
 * one leg alone leaves the chip standing. {@link #theEsterIsGoneWhateverArmWouldHaveRaisedIt} is the
 * case that fails for a one-leg fix; the two before it isolate each leg.
 *
 * <p><b>What must NOT narrow</b> is asserted beside it, because the risk of a more precise resolver is
 * dropping a real finding: a string that names the weaker claimant OUTRIGHT still puts it in play
 * ({@link #aStringThatNamesTheEsterOutrightStillPutsItInPlay}), a combination order name still puts
 * every constituent substance in play ({@link #aCombinationOrderNameKeepsEveryConstituentSubstance}),
 * and a localized order name still resolves at all ({@link #aLocalizedOrderNameStillResolves}, issue
 * #147's shape).
 *
 * <p>Slices taken verbatim from the shipped KB, driven through the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}
 * parser and the real {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate(String, String, PatientClinicalContext)}.
