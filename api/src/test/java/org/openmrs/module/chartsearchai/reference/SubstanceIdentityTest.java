/**
 * A substance is not reported as cross-reactive, or interacting, with ITSELF (issue #164) — and two
 * substances the reference data files under one substance NAME still get a chip each (issues #121,
 * #145).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect, two routes.</b> Both were measured live on the 3.7.1 standalone and both survive
 * the substance key #145/#160/#173 built, because neither is a key that was too wide — one is a test
 * that was too narrow and the other is a key that was too conservative.
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The mirror path.</b> {@code IDENTITY} was awarded on ENTRY identity
 *       ({@code allergen == ref}). When the row an allergy resolves to is a SIBLING that the question
 *       does not itself put in play, the group holds no identity candidate at all, so the best
 *       available relationship is the class comparison — against the same substance. Measured as
 *       "Is Tetryzoline (nasal) safe?" against an allergy recorded as {@code Tetryzoline
 *       (ophthalmic)}, and as the Pfizer/Tozinameran pair below.</li>
 *   <li><b>Stem divergence.</b> {@code Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine} and {@code Tozinameran}
 *       publish one {@code rxnorm_name} and one {@code rxcui} but no display stem in common, so the
 *       stem VETO kept them apart — and the resulting chip reads as a self-reference anyway. The same
 *       shape sits in the interaction arm: {@code Daxibotulinumtoxina} against
 *       {@code Botulinum toxin type A}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>What decides that two rows are one substance</b>, and why the stem alone could not. The
 * reference data's substance name over-merges — {@code Omeprazole}/{@code Esomeprazole} publish one
 * {@code rxnorm_name}, one {@code rxcui} and one ATC code and are two substances — so something has
 * to veto it. The stem was that veto, and it is a display-name heuristic: it separates the two PPIs
 * correctly and separates {@code Tozinameran} from its own brand row incorrectly, because it cannot
 * tell a second SUBSTANCE from a second NAME. The reference data can: each row carries a
 * {@code drugbank_id}, an identifier of a substance rather than of a presentation. So the veto is now
 * that identifier — a substance-name family that names TWO OR MORE DrugBank substances holds more
 * than one substance and keeps the stem in force; one that names at most one is a single substance
 * and has nothing for the stem to veto. See {@link DrugReference#substanceKey()} for the
 * measurements.
 *
 * <p>Both directions are asserted here, against slices taken verbatim from the shipped KB, through
 * the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource} parser and the real
 * {@link DrugSafetyValidator#validate(String, String, PatientClinicalContext)}.
