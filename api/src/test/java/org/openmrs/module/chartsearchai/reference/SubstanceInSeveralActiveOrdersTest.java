 * <p><b>The defect.</b> The class arm's restating-existing-therapy skip
 * ({@code DrugSafetyValidator.classRelationships}) is right for one co-medication and blind to a
 * second: every order of one substance is one co-medication (issue #186), so a patient on two
 * tuberculosis combinations that both contain rifampicin, asked about rifampicin, heard that it
 * interacts with the pyrazinamide IN those combinations — and nothing saying she already receives
 * rifampicin, twice.
 *
 * <p><b>What decides that an order carries the substance</b> is its DISPLAY — the name the chip
 * prints — through {@link DrugReferenceService#findNamedSubstances}, never another of its recorded
 * names (issue #293's rule) and never a shared ATC code alone (this knowledge base files
 * {@code Omeprazole} under esomeprazole's code). Both are pinned below by a case that would name an
 * order which does not contain the substance.
