/**
 * Issue #250 — which row of a substance {@link DrugReference#canonicalRow} elects to represent it.
 * Before this issue the fold had ONE rung — prefer the row that
 * {@link DrugReference#namesNoRoute()} — and a fallback to the earliest row seen. Nothing preferred the row whose display name IS the name
 * the data files the family under, so where two rows of one substance both name no route the tie fell
 * to dataset order — and on the shipped KB the row that wins that race is
 * {@code Fluoroestradiol f-18}, a diagnostic PET tracer at index 1282, against {@code Estradiol} at
 * 1927.
 *
 * <p>Reproduced live on a 3.7.1 standalone with the stock shipped dataset: <em>"Is it safe to give her
 * estradiol?"</em> was answered <em>"No — Fluoroestradiol f-18 should not be given: it interacts with
 * active order methylprednisolone …"</em>, over five interaction chips every one of which was subjected
 * on the tracer, with the word {@code estradiol} appearing nowhere except inside
 * {@code Fluoroestradiol}. So the wrong row does not stay in the chip: {@code renderFinding} carries
 * the chip detail into the prompt verbatim and the model answers from it.
 *
 * <p>The MERGE is not what this fixes. {@code Fluoroestradiol f-18} carries no {@code drugbank_id}, so
 * the DDInter parser files it under the estradiol family's resolved substance id — a data defect
 * {@code DrugReferenceValidity.DERIVATIVE_MERGED_WITH_ITS_PARENT_SUBSTANCE} reports and deliberately
 * leaves as loaded, because splitting the rows would invent the fact the data is missing. Given the
 * merge, this is the other half: which of the merged rows speaks for the substance.
 *
 * <p>Two dataset sources, both read by the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}, and which a case takes
 * follows from what it asserts rather than from a list here — an earlier version of this sentence
 * enumerated them and went stale twice in eight commits. A case asserting a property of the SHIPPED
 * dataset reads the shipped knowledge base ({@code DrugReferenceTestSupport.shippedEntries}); a case
 * asserting particular chip or record TEXT reads a verbatim slice, so a refresh that leaves one family
 * alone cannot rewrite what it expects. Every scenario runs a real production entry point with real
 * question strings and GP reads on their no-context defaults.
