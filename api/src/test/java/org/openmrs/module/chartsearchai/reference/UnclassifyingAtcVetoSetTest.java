/**
 * A tripwire on the KEY that {@code DrugReference.UNCLASSIFYING_ATC_GROUPS}' published figures are
 * measured against (issue #263).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect it exists to prevent, which has already happened once.</b> A figure keyed on
 * {@code UNCLASSIFYING_ATC_GROUPS} was read from issue #182 until issue #263 while that list grew
 * from 30 members to 36 at issue #184 (PR #241), so a sentence saying a rule keeps N pairs came to
 * describe a rule this class no longer applies. Nothing reddened: the change was to a list and the
 * stale value was in prose. The figures, their bases and the whole of that story are at
 * {@code DrugReference.UNCLASSIFYING_ATC_GROUPS}, and are deliberately not repeated here.
 *
 * <p><b>So this pins the veto set rather than the figures.</b> It asserts, of the level-4 subgroups
 * the shipped knowledge base actually publishes, which ones
 * {@link DrugReference#isUnclassifyingAtcCode} refuses — one direct call of the production predicate
 * per subgroup, over the production load, with no composition of its own. It reddens when a change
 * reaches a subgroup this KB publishes: a group added to {@code UNCLASSIFYING_ATC_GROUPS} or removed
 * from it, or a KB refresh that changes the NUMBER of level-4 subgroups the dataset publishes or
 * which of them the list refuses. When it goes red,
 * re-measure that constant's own counts and update them with it, saying which method produced them.
 * {@code LOCALLY_APPLIED_ATC_GROUPS}' 46/21 and 19/2 are NOT due on that red — they are taken with
 * the claim filters off, i.e. with {@code UNCLASSIFYING_ATC_GROUPS} emptied, so a change to it
 * cannot move them. They are keyed on {@code LOCALLY_APPLIED_ATC_GROUPS} instead, and their tripwire
 * is {@link LocallyAppliedAtcGroupKeyTest}, which reddens on a change to that list this one is
 * silent on; a KB refresh is due on both. The exemption does not run the other way, and that class's
 * javadoc says why: {@code sharedClass} consults {@link DrugReference#isLocallyAppliedAtcCode} on
 * every call, to decide WHICH of a pair's shared subgroups it returns, so
 * {@code UNCLASSIFYING_ATC_GROUPS}' own counts and attributions are due on that case's red as well as
 * on this one's.
 *
 * <p><b>Two holes, both real, and the second is the likelier one.</b> A group added that covers no
 * subgroup this KB publishes is invisible: 9 of the shipped list's 36 members are already in that
 * position (measured 2026-08-29 — {@code A07AX}, {@code C05BX}, {@code D02AX}, {@code D03AX},
 * {@code R03BX}, {@code S01JX}, {@code S01KX}, {@code S02DC}, {@code V07A}), and the list's own
 * javadoc says of two of them that they are members on the criterion rather than on measured impact.
 * And a KB refresh can move every pair figure this class is a tripwire for while leaving this case
 * green, because its assertions are keyed on the NUMBER of level-4 subgroups the dataset publishes
 * and on which of them the list refuses, and neither of those counts rows or pairs. Two shapes
 * escape: ROWS added or removed under subgroups the dataset already publishes, and a swap of one
 * unrefused subgroup for another, which leaves the count and the refused set alike. Measured for the
 * first: dropping 1372 of the shipped KB's 2283 rows and adding 2, chosen so the published set is
 * unchanged, leaves this case passing.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does NOT pin, stated so the guard does not look stronger than it is.</b> Not the
 * figures themselves: they are answers of {@code DrugSafetyValidator.sharedClass}, which is private,
 * so computing its null condition here would be a reimplementation of pipeline logic. Issue #263
 * reached them by temporarily mutating the production source, and of the two counterfactuals named
 * below only one could have been reached from the INPUTS instead. Vetoing a subgroup and removing it
 * from the caller's code set both end in the same {@code continue}, so the blanket-residue one is
 * input-reachable. Striking the four locally-applied prefixes behind
 * {@code LOCALLY_APPLIED_ATC_GROUPS}' 46/21 is not: it needs one of those four returned EAGERLY,
 * ahead of a surviving systemic subgroup, and no uniform input transformation promotes one there —
 * the unmutated method does return them, but through the fallback, when nothing systemic survives.
 * Deciding per pair which subgroups to withhold would re-express this loop's own ordering rule,
 * which is the re-implementation the measurement rule forbids. This guard only says when the figures
 * are due to be taken again.
