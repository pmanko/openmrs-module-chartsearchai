/**
 * Issue #308: an injected {@code safety_finding} says how its rule was matched, where nothing
 * corroborates that match as a record of the drug.
 *
 * <p>Issue #269 gave the injected {@code drug_reference} record a third section for such a clause —
 * {@code Matched in this patient's chart but not corroborated as a record of this drug:} — and left
 * the {@code safety_finding} beside it alone. Measured live afterwards (issue #308, on a real
 * standalone with the real model): the model answers from the finding and never surfaces the hedge,
 * because the finding is the unqualified one of the two. So the prompt carried two citable records of
 * one fact, one qualified and one bare, and the bare one won.
 *
 * <p><b>What this change does NOT do, and the measurement that decides it.</b> The finding keeps
 * {@code STRENGTH_WITHHOLD}. The tempting fix — a third strength class between withholding and a
 * caution — was refuted at plan time on two recorded measurements. ADR Decision 42 deferred
 * "whether the finding itself should state its PROVENANCE", provenance and not strength; and it
 * records that the corroboration union can be WRONG in the false-negative direction, on a clause
 * "both legs miss" while the chart really does hold the allergy. ADR Decision 37 measured what a
 * contraindication finding stating no withholding clause produces on this very drug and question
 * shape: <em>"No — ibuprofen should not be taken"</em> became <em>"Ibuprofen can be given, with one
 * caution"</em>, 3 of 3, with the chip byte-identical. Weakening the call on a gate that can be wrong
 * that way is fail-open in a safety net, so this change is MONOTONE: it adds words and moves no call.
 * {@link #theFindingStillStatesTheStrongestCallItStatedBefore} is that invariant, and it is the case
 * to read first if a future change wants the strength to move.
 *
 * <p>Prompt-facing as issue #308 shipped it, exactly as issue #283 scoped its own clauses: the chip's
 * detail and the chip's rank are untouched, so issues #146 and #223 — which twice refused to GATE this
 * chip on corroboration — are not reopened. The chip is still raised; it says how it was matched when
 * it reaches the model. The {@code safetyWarnings} WIRE shape is no longer untouched — issue #374
 * publishes this same answer as the chip's own {@code restsOnAnUncorroboratedChartMatch} key, and
 * never inside the detail; {@link #theChipTheClinicianSeesIsTheStringItWas} is where that line is
 * drawn.
 *
 * <p>Every case here drives the real {@code DrugReferenceInjector.injectRecords} wired to the real
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator} over a fixture parsed by the real production parser, and reads the
 * record a model would read.
