/**
 * Which of a substance's ATC codes an order the concept dictionary did NOT classify is compared on —
 * issue #234.
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> After issue #228 the duplicate-therapy class arm reaches every active order,
 * but on two different authorities: a dictionary-MAPPED order is compared on the DICTIONARY's code
 * for its concept, and an unmapped one on every code the reference DATASET files its substance under.
 * The dataset's list covers every presentation the substance is marketed as, and
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.sharedClass} prefers a subgroup that is not locally applied (issue
 * #161), so the systemic one always won: an unmapped {@code Hydrocortisone cream 1%} was named as a
 * co-medication in an {@code H02AB} systemic-corticosteroid chip that the same order, mapped to
 * {@code D07AA02}, correctly does not raise. Mapping an order more correctly made the module quieter,
 * and the chip an implementer saw was the wrong one of the two.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the ticket's own suggested remedy is not the fix.</b> It proposed preferring "a row whose
 * administration route matches". Measured through {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource#parse},
 * {@link DrugReference#substanceGroupKey()} and {@link DrugReference#normalizedAtcCodes()} over the
 * shipped 19 MB knowledge base, all 129 of its multi-row substances publish an IDENTICAL ATC code
 * list across every one of their rows and none differs — the invariant
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.entryForAtcCode}'s javadoc already states from the other side. Picking a
 * row therefore cannot change any classification, so the narrowing has to be of the CODES.
 *
 * <p>Every case here runs the real {@code DrugSafetyValidator.validate} over a verbatim knowledge-base
 * slice parsed by the real {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}, or over the shipped knowledge base itself.
 * The order's recorded administration is what drives the narrowing and the order's NAME never is —
 * {@code UnmappedOrderClassPartnerTest.thePartnerIsNamedByTheRowTheORDERRecords} pins a chip for an
 * order literally named {@code Hydrocortisone (topical)}, and that assertion is untouched by this
 * change.
