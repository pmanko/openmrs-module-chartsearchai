/**
 * Whether the duplicate-therapy class arm can see an active order the concept dictionary did not map
 * to ATC — issue #228.
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> {@code DrugSafetyValidator.orderPartners} walked
 * {@link PatientClinicalContext#getActiveDrugAtcCodes()} and nothing else, so a patient's
 * co-medications were exactly the subset of her prescriptions a DICTIONARY happened to classify. An
 * order carrying no {@code WHOATC} map produced no partner, and the whole arm was silently
 * unreachable for it however well the loaded reference data knows that drug by name. This is the
 * same key-mismatch issue #151 fixed one layer over in {@code DrugReferenceInjector} — the sparsity
 * belongs to the dictionary, never to the reference data, which classifies most of what it carries.
 *
 * <p>A MISSING warning, which is the direction this feature exists to prevent and the one that
 * leaves no trace: no chip, no log line, nothing separating "no duplicate therapy" from "could not
 * look".
 *
 * <p><b>What must not move, and why the cases below are shaped as pairs.</b> Widening what an order
 * resolves to widens what the restating-existing-therapy skip (issue #185) and the co-medication
 * grouping (issue #186) see. So every widening case here has a companion asserting the thing the
 * widening could break: the drug the order itself NAMES must not be reported as duplicating that
 * order, and a combination order must stay as many co-medications as it has substances rather than
 * silencing the chip that names one of them.
 *
 * <p>Every scenario runs the REAL production path — a verbatim KB slice parsed by the real
 * {@link DdiDrugReferenceSource}, or the curated fixture parsed by the real
 * {@link JsonDrugReferenceSource}, through the real {@code validate} entry point.
