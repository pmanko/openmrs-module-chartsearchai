/**
 * An injected finding that carries no severity rating says so, and one that carries a rating does not
 * (issue #402's residue (a), ADR Decision 123).
 *
 * <p><b>The defect.</b> The prompt asks the answer to carry each finding's severity, and a record of
 * an unrated finding — every contraindication, a class-only relationship, the several-orders finding —
 * stated none. Measured on the live gate, on {@code main} and on the branch alike, the model filled
 * the gap with a rating no chip carries: <em>"(Major)"</em> on an unrated cross-reactivity
 * contraindication, <em>"(Unknown severity)"</em> on an unrated duplicate-therapy finding. The
 * record now states the absence, between the detail and the strength
 * clause so the call stays sentence-final.
