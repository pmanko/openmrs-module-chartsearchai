/**
 * A {@code Drug} the module cannot read costs that order its coded NAME, and not the chart's whole
 * active-order read (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/413">#413</a>).
 *
 * <p><b>What was wrong.</b> {@code DrugOrder.drug} is a LAZY association —
 * {@link PatientClinicalContextBuilder#drug} carries the mapping that makes it one, and is the one
 * home for that fact. {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder} dereferenced it in three places, all
 * inside the active-order {@code for} and all before the order is added to the per-order list,
 * while the only {@code catch} sits OUTSIDE that loop. So one unreadable drug cost the order it was
 * on and every order AFTER it — an empty {@code getActiveDrugOrders()} only where the failing order
 * was the first, which is patient 7 here and was the issue's own reproduction — with
 * {@code activeDrugOrdersRead()} false and the chart stamped unread either way, so
 * {@code GET /chartsearchai/chartalerts} answered {@code screened: false} for a patient whose chart
 * holds findings.
 *
 * <p><b>How the throw is arranged, and why this way.</b> A context-sensitive test holds an open
 * Hibernate session by construction, so the {@code LazyInitializationException} the issue reproduces
 * ("no Session") cannot be staged here. What can is the OTHER way initialising that proxy throws and
 * a real database can be in: the order pointing at a {@code drug} row that is not there, which
 * Hibernate's default {@code not-found="exception"} answers with an
 * {@code org.hibernate.ObjectNotFoundException}. Both are {@code RuntimeException}s raised by
 * initialising this one association, which is what the three call sites above each did.
 *
 * <p><b>Since issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/421">#421</a> the loop
 * holds no {@code Drug} at all</b>, which is what this class's structural case pins. Issue #413 had
 * already left exactly ONE dereference of the association, inside the accessor, and the first
 * assertion below has pinned that count since then; what #421 removed is the three reads the loop
 * made on the entity that accessor RETURNED. {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder.drug} makes them
 * itself now, inside its own {@code try}, and hands back the VALUES. The behavioural cases below are
 * unchanged by that and still drive the real builder; what changed is that the guard beneath them
 * asks a question the compiler can answer rather than one a text scan has to spell.
 *
 * <p><b>The fixture COMMITS, and that is why it restores by hand.</b> The repointing is raw SQL —
 * the technique {@code NonCodedDrugOrderNameTest} already arranges order 111 with — around core's
 * {@code turnOffDBConstraints}, because the test database is H2 built by
 * {@code hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=create-drop} and really does carry the foreign key: measured, the
 * same UPDATE without the toggle is refused as {@code Referential integrity constraint violation}.
 * What that buys has a price the sibling classes do not pay — {@code SET REFERENTIAL_INTEGRITY}
 * COMMITS the open transaction, so this class's writes outlive the rollback that returns theirs,
 * and surefire is configured with neither {@code forkCount} nor {@code reuseForks}, so one reused
 * JVM runs every class against the one H2 database. Measured: with the restore below removed and
 * the suite run {@code -Dsurefire.runOrder=reversealphabetical}, this class reddens several sibling
 * classes that drive the same rows, {@code NonCodedDrugOrderNameTest} among them. So {@link #restoreTheFixture} puts back every column and
 * property a case here writes, commits them through {@link #commitEverythingWrittenSoFar}, and then
 * reads every one of them back — a restore that silently did nothing is the failure being guarded
 * against, and asserting one of them would have hidden the rest. What the read-back cannot see is
 * stated on {@link #restored}.
 *
 * <p>A case here therefore assumes nothing about the stock state of the rows it uses, since another
 * class in this package mutates the same order.

	 * The structural half: the association is reached through ONE guarded accessor and nowhere else.

	 * is, which is why the offset is placed inside the accessor's own body: a single dereference that
	 * had migrated back out to a call site would satisfy a count and reinstate the defect.
	 *
	 * <p><b>The third assertion stopped being text, and that is issue #421.</b> It used to permit a
	 * short allow-list of reads on the {@code Drug} the accessor handed back and refuse everything
	 * else. No text rule in that family answered the question: measured on {@code 01337385}, a chain written
	 * {@code drug.getConcept()} + newline + {@code .getName();} in {@code addDrugName} left the whole
	 * api suite green, and so did a receiver wrapped as {@code drug} + newline + {@code .getConcept();}
	 * — the second for a different reason, the needle {@code drug.get} matching no offset at all, so
	 * the allow-list never ran. Sharpening the pattern would have closed the first and not the second.
	 * So the production side stopped handing back an entity instead: {@code CodedDrug} carries the
	 * three VALUES the loop needs, every one read inside the accessor's own {@code try}, and a
	 * dereference at a call site is now a compile error rather than a spelling for a scan to
	 * recognise. What this assertion pins is that property — the accessor hands back no {@code Drug}
	 * — asked of the compiled class rather than of the source text.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What these three assertions are for, and what they are not.</b> They catch the ordinary
	 * edit — a {@code Drug} put back on {@code CodedDrug} so the loop can reach it again, a second
	 * naming of the association, a catch narrowed to the exception this suite happens to stage. Two
	 * of the three are still text over one file, so an edit that sets out to evade them can: a decoy
	 * {@code catch (RuntimeException …)} placed inside the accessor while the real handler is
	 * narrowed. That was measured green, and adding a rule per spelling is the loop this class
	 * declines to enter — a reviewer, not a regex, is what catches an edit written to get past them.
	 * The residues that remain: the text pair reads ONE file, so {@code drugOrder.getDrug()} called
	 * from another class is outside them — there is none today, and nothing here would notice one
	 * arriving; and the {@code getDrug()} needle carries no receiver, so a call wrapped across lines
	 * IS caught while one spelled {@code getDrug ()} is not.
	 *
	 * <p><b>And the third assertion is about the {@code Drug} alone, deliberately.</b> It walks the
	 * builder and every class nested in it, so a SECOND carrier holding the entity is caught as well
	 * as {@code CodedDrug} ({@link #collectEntityCarriers} carries the measurement for that), and it
	 * asks of a member's DECLARED type rather than its raw one — {@link #handsOutTheEntity} states
	 * the two questions it puts and what it admits, and is the only place either belongs. What it
	 * admits on purpose is the two {@code Concept} proxies the carrier holds, the
	 * drug's own concept and its dose form: {@code Drug.hbm.xml} maps both default-lazy, so a read of
	 * one at a call site compiles and can throw just as a read of the entity could. Measured, with the
	 * spelling stated because the other one answers differently: a null-guarded
	 * {@code if (coded.dosageForm != null) coded.dosageForm.getUuid();} at a call site leaves this
	 * class green, while the UNGUARDED read reddens the behavioural cases wholesale — on the null dose
	 * form every order without one has, not on the lazy read this paragraph is about. That is not
	 * this guard's subject and must not become it — the loop NEEDS those two, and what keeps them safe
	 * is that every helper reading a concept opens its own {@code try}, which
	 * {@code PatientClinicalContextBuilder.conceptUuid}'s javadoc is the one home for. None of these
	 * residues is worth a cleverer pattern: what this guard is for is the ordinary edit, and the
