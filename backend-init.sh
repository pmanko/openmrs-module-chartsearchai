#   querystore/vocab.txt .......... BERT WordPiece vocab for e5
#   chartsearchai/<gguf-file> ..... local LLM weights — Gemma 4 E4B (~5GB),
#                                   with Gemma 4 E2B (~3GB) also pulled so

#                                   two by flipping chartsearchai.llm.modelFilePath
#
# Architectural note: chartsearchai delegates retrieval to querystore via
# `chartsearchai.querystore.enabled=true` (the recommended deployment).
# That path uses the embedder under querystore/ for top-K retrieval, with
# the local LLM doing the filtering in the answer phase. chartsearchai's
# own embedding-pre-filter pipeline (querystore=false, preFilter=true) is
# being deprecated — its filter thresholds are L6-v2-distribution-specific
# and don't transfer to other embedders without re-tuning — so we don't
# provision a chartsearchai-side embedder here.
#
# Operator wiring (global properties) required for fresh deployments —
# both modules ship these with empty/false defaults, so the files this
# script provisions are unused until an operator points the GPs at them:
#   chartsearchai.querystore.enabled    = true
#   querystore.embedding.modelFilePath  = querystore/model.onnx
#   querystore.embedding.vocabFilePath  = querystore/vocab.txt
#   querystore.embedding.queryModelFilePath = (empty — single encoder)
# A follow-up change will move those defaults into querystore's config.xml
# so a fresh deploy works without manual GP wiring; until then, the
# project README's deployment section is the source of truth.

# When started as root (deployments without a separate init container that
# chowns the volume), heal pre-Apr-27 root-owned contents and drop to the

# ---- embedder: e5-base-v2 ---------------------------------------------------
# e5-base-v2 was chosen empirically over the alternatives we tested
# (sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and ncbi/MedCPT-* article+query
# encoders). On colloquial clinical questions a chart-search user actually
# types — "any heart issues?", "any cardiovascular issues?" — it bridges
# to the formal clinical record terms ("Cerebrovascular Accident") that
# L6-v2's tighter clusters miss and that MedCPT's PubMed-trained clusters
# pedantically refuse to associate. The 50% divergence we measured
# against chartsearchai's L6-v2-tuned eval baseline is the LLM-as-filter
# design absorbing what L6-v2 used to do at the retrieval layer; on the
# querystore + LLM path that's a property, not a quality regression.
#
# Source is Xenova's ONNX export rather than `intfloat/e5-base-v2`'s
# canonical repo: Xenova ships a self-contained model.onnx file, while
# the canonical repo's onnx/ subdirectory uses external-data format
# (graph file + separate `model.onnx_data` weights sidecar). Downloading
# only the graph file produces a tiny "successful" file that the ONNX
# runtime can open but cannot execute — the bug shape that broke the
# previous L6-v2 download. The size guard below is the second line of
# defense against any future upstream format change.

# ---- LLM: Gemma 4 E4B Instruct, Q4_K_M -------------------------------------
# Chosen over Gemma 4 E2B, Gemma 4 26B-MoE, and Llama-3.2-3B as the
# smallest model that reliably filters querystore's top-K candidates
# without the small-LLM failure modes we observed:
#   - Llama-3.2-3B collapsed pulse readings into "HB" values when given a
#     full chart, and over-trusted retrieval prior in querystore mode
#     (cited "Cocaine abuse" as a medication).
#   - Gemma 4 E2B over-cited (included benign neoplasms in cancer answers,
#     listed 18 BP readings as cardiovascular records).
#   - Gemma 4 26B-MoE is marginally cleaner on edge cases but its ~16GB
#     footprint isn't justified given E4B's strength on this question class.
# E4B holds the benign/malignant distinction, keeps citations focused on
# clinically-relevant records, and fits in ~5GB of memory.

# ---- one-shot demo dataset seed --------------------------------------------
# Load a fixed OpenMRS demo dump (5,284-patient reference set) into the database
# the first time a backend built with this entrypoint boots against a DB that
# hasn't been seeded with it yet. This is how the chartsearchai.openmrs.org demo
# gets its dataset without any direct DB access: the seed runs in-container
# against the `db` service over the compose network, on an ordinary deploy — no
# volume wipe, so the downloaded models and runtime properties are untouched.
#
# Safety:
#   * Gated by a sentinel global property -> runs exactly once.
#   * Backs up the current DB to the persistent /openmrs/data volume first.
#   * On any failure it restores that backup (or leaves the existing data
#     untouched) and falls through to a normal start — a failed seed never
#     bricks the demo.
#   * Snapshots and restores the server's own chartsearchai/querystore global
#     properties, so the dump's config (LLM endpoint, model paths) does not
#     overwrite the operator's wiring.
# The repairs mirror what loading this dump requires (orphan rows, stale module
# changelog rows, liquibase checksums); see commit history for the rationale.
