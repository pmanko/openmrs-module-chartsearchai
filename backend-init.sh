# Architectural note: chartsearchai delegates retrieval to querystore via

# That path uses the embedder under querystore/ for top-K retrieval, with
# the local LLM doing the filtering in the answer phase. chartsearchai's
# own embedding-pre-filter pipeline (querystore=false, preFilter=true) is
# being deprecated — its filter thresholds are L6-v2-distribution-specific
# and don't transfer to other embedders without re-tuning — so we don't
# provision a chartsearchai-side embedder here.
#
# Retrieval wiring (global properties). Both modules ship these with
# empty/false defaults, so the files provisioned here would be unused
# until something points the properties at them:
#   chartsearchai.querystore.enabled    = true
#   querystore.embedding.modelFilePath  = querystore/model.onnx
#   querystore.embedding.vocabFilePath  = querystore/vocab.txt
#   querystore.embedding.queryModelFilePath = (empty — single encoder)
# configure_retrieval_gps below now writes them, on every start and only
# where the property is blank, so a deliberately-set value survives a
# start that verifies. Two writes are not blank-only:
# chartsearchai.querystore.enabled on the seed path, which
# maybe_seed_demo_data asserts outright because a freshly imported dump
# carries its own value for it, and the withdrawal on a start that
# verified no embedder, which blanks the two embedder paths and the
# query-encoder row beside them whatever they held — an operator's own
# value included. They used to be an operator step, which meant they
# lived nowhere but the demo's database and a
# --destroy-volumes deploy deleted the wiring along with it; see that

# ---- embedder: e5-base-v2 ---------------------------------------------------
# e5-base-v2 was chosen empirically over the alternatives we tested
# (sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and ncbi/MedCPT-* article+query
# encoders). On colloquial clinical questions a chart-search user actually
# types — "any heart issues?", "any cardiovascular issues?" — it bridges
# to the formal clinical record terms ("Cerebrovascular Accident") that
# L6-v2's tighter clusters miss and that MedCPT's PubMed-trained clusters
# pedantically refuse to associate. The 50% divergence we measured
# against chartsearchai's L6-v2-tuned eval baseline is the LLM-as-filter
# design absorbing what L6-v2 used to do at the retrieval layer; on the
# querystore + LLM path that's a property, not a quality regression.
#
# Source is Xenova's ONNX export rather than `intfloat/e5-base-v2`'s
# canonical repo: Xenova ships a self-contained model.onnx file, while
# the canonical repo's onnx/ subdirectory uses external-data format
# (graph file + separate `model.onnx_data` weights sidecar). Downloading
# only the graph file produces a tiny "successful" file that the ONNX
# runtime can open but cannot execute — the bug shape that broke the
# previous L6-v2 download. Since #444 the pinned revision and digest rule
# that out ahead of the size check, which stays for its diagnostic.
#
# Every model file below is fetched from the immutable revision recorded
# in model-manifest.tsv and refused unless it hashes to the sha256
# committed beside it — on EVERY start, not only after a fresh download,
# because /openmrs/data outlives the container. ADR Decision 106 carries
# why, and what happens to a file that fails. "On every start" is a claim
# about where these two calls sit as much as about what they call, so
# ModelDownloadPinningGuardTest
# .everyArtifactTheEntrypointProvisionsIsFetchedUnconditionally refuses a
# test of the file's own presence wrapped around either of them.
#
# A refusal leaves chart search OFF and the start RUNNING. What makes that
# fail-closed is the ledger, not a stopped container: nothing is recorded
# for a refused artifact, so require_verified declines below, no path to it
# is written, and whatever path the row holds is taken back, an operator's
# own included — by blanking the row, or, where that cannot be confirmed,
# by moving the copy out from under the name it carries. Exiting here
# instead cost the whole instance and the SPA with it, for a chart-search
# dependency. Decision 106's amendment records what was observed and what
# is inferred from it.

# ---- LLM: Gemma 4 E4B Instruct, Q4_K_M -------------------------------------
# Chosen over Gemma 4 E2B, Gemma 4 26B-MoE, and Llama-3.2-3B as the
# smallest model that reliably filters querystore's top-K candidates
# without the small-LLM failure modes we observed:
#   - Llama-3.2-3B collapsed pulse readings into "HB" values when given a
#     full chart, and over-trusted retrieval prior in querystore mode
#     (cited "Cocaine abuse" as a medication).
#   - Gemma 4 E2B over-cited (included benign neoplasms in cancer answers,
#     listed 18 BP readings as cardiovascular records).
#   - Gemma 4 26B-MoE is marginally cleaner on edge cases but its ~16GB
#     footprint isn't justified given E4B's strength on this question class.
# E4B holds the benign/malignant distinction, keeps citations focused on
# clinically-relevant records, and fits in ~5GB of memory.
#
# Background the work and resume on container restart via `curl -C -` so
# OpenMRS can become healthy without waiting for it. On a volume whose
# weights already verify, that work is the hash alone and nothing is
# downloaded or renamed; on a fresh or failing one it is the transfer,
# which can take far longer than the deploy's health budget allows
# (docker-compose.yml gives the backend a 30m start_period). Chart search
# queries return errors for as long as no verified file is in place —
# including the window after a file that WAS serving is refused.
# Inner worker: fetches and verifies, or verifies what is already on the
# volume. Receives all required values as positional args so each
# backgrounded invocation has its own argument snapshot — reading globals
# from a backgrounded subshell would race with the parent shell's next
# fetch_llm_in_background call overwriting them. fetch_and_verify keeps the
# same discipline, and prefixes every variable of its own with _mm_.
#
# A refusal here stops nothing, as the embedder's no longer does either: the
# weights are fetched in the background precisely so OpenMRS can come up
# without them, and chart search already reports its own error while the
# file is absent. The difference that remains is the WAITING — these two run
# in background subshells and the embedder's run in this shell, because the
# ledger the property write consults cannot be written from a subshell.
# What matters in both is that rejected bytes are deleted rather than left
# under the name config.xml points modelFilePath at — on the codes that
# report a deletion. Codes 4 and 5 report none: 4 never opens the target,

# ---- one-shot demo dataset seed --------------------------------------------
# Load a fixed OpenMRS demo dump (5,284-patient reference set) into the database
# the first time a backend built with this entrypoint boots against a DB that
# hasn't been seeded with it yet. This is how the chartsearchai.openmrs.org demo
# gets its dataset without any direct DB access: the seed runs in-container
# against the `db` service over the compose network.
#
# Two deploy shapes reach here, and they are not equivalent. On an ordinary
# deploy nothing is wiped, so the models and runtime properties survive and the
# sentinel below skips the seed entirely. On a --destroy-volumes deploy this is
# the code that repopulates an empty database — and the database it hands back
# is then complete while openmrs-data is empty, which is a combination OpenMRS
# does not otherwise produce. The two steps after this function exist for that
# case and must stay downstream of it.
#
# Safety:
#   * Gated by a sentinel global property -> runs exactly once.
#   * Backs up the current DB to the persistent /openmrs/data volume first.
#   * On any failure it restores that backup (or leaves the existing data
#     untouched) and falls through to a normal start — a failed seed never
#     bricks the demo.
#   * Snapshots and restores the server's own chartsearchai/querystore global
#     properties, so the dump's config (LLM endpoint, model paths) does not
#     overwrite the operator's wiring. Two properties are then set deliberately
#     AFTER that restore — querystore.bootstrap.autostart and
#     chartsearchai.querystore.enabled — because a freshly imported dump brings
#     its own values for both and they describe the dump, not this server. That
#     is the one place the restore is overridden on purpose.
# The repairs mirror what loading this dump requires (orphan rows, stale module
# changelog rows, liquibase checksums); see commit history for the rationale.

# OMRS_CONFIG_* environment), and startup.sh then drives OpenMRS's
# InitializationFilter with it by curl-ing /openmrs/ shortly after Tomcat comes
# up. That script carries create_tables=${OMRS_CONFIG_CREATE_TABLES}, which the
# deployed compose sets to true.
#
# create_tables=true means "this database is empty, build the schema". That is
# right for a virgin install and wrong for every database this entrypoint hands
# to OpenMRS: maybe_seed_demo_data above imports a COMPLETE OpenMRS database, so
# on the first boot after a volume wipe (deploy.yml's `reset` input, which passes
# --destroy-volumes) the installer runs against a schema that already exists. It
# dies on the first CREATE TABLE of the 2.8.x schema-only snapshot — "Table
# 'allergy' already exists" — and the install is abandoned. /openmrs/ then
# redirects to /openmrs/initialsetup for the life of the container, so a visitor
# to the demo gets an installation screen. (The application itself does come up
# behind that redirect on this path — modules load and the REST API answers --
# which is why nothing downstream complained: the old healthcheck probed
# /openmrs/ and was satisfied by the very redirect that was the symptom, and the
# deploy had already reported success. Both are addressed alongside this: see
# the HEALTHCHECK in Dockerfile.backend.)
#
# It clears on a restart — the abandoned install leaves openmrs-runtime.properties
# behind, so the next boot skips the wizard — which is exactly why it bites only
# the first boot after a wipe and why steady-state checks never see it.
#
# So decide create_tables from the database rather than from the environment.
# The same correction covers a wipe of openmrs-data alone (db-data kept), where
# the schema likewise predates the installer.
#
# Keep this even though the next step usually makes it moot. Writing the runtime
# properties stops the installer from running at all, so create_tables is then
# never read — but that write can fail (it says so and falls through), and this
# is what makes that fallback land on a working instance instead of the wizard.
# The two are a pair: do not drop one as redundant with the other.

# the application successfully. Measured on the published image with the
# create_tables correction above in place: the install completes cleanly, the
# context refreshes, /openmrs/ws/rest/v1/session answers 200, and /openmrs/ still
# serves the setup wizard until the container is restarted. A visitor to

# The file only ever lives in the openmrs-data volume, so a --destroy-volumes

# ---- retrieval wiring (global properties) ----------------------------------
# This script provisions querystore/model.onnx and querystore/vocab.txt at the
# top, but the properties that point querystore at them live in the DATABASE,
# and both modules ship them empty. Until now they were set by hand on the demo,
# so a --destroy-volumes deploy deleted the wiring along with the database. The
# header of this file has described exactly these as an operator step with a
# "follow-up change" pending since the querystore migration; this is it.
#
# Leaving them unset costs more than a disabled feature. maybe_seed_demo_data
# turns querystore.bootstrap.autostart on, so the next start sweeps every record
# of all 5,284 seeded patients — and with modelFilePath unset each record throws
# IllegalStateException out of OnnxEmbeddingProvider and is logged with a full
# stack trace. Measured against the published image on a wiped volume: 112MB of
# stack traces in the first eight minutes and still climbing, on a host that also
# ships its logs to Loki.
#
# Written only where the property is blank, so an operator who deliberately
# points these elsewhere keeps their value — the same courtesy the seed already
# extends by snapshotting chartsearchai%/querystore% across the import.

# Takes the embedder paths back to the empty string, and answers whether the DATABASE now carries
# that verdict rather than whether the statements were issued. Three rows go: the two querystore
# resolves with optional=false, and the query-encoder path beside them, which the last paragraph
# below is about. Each property is spelled at its own statement, the way the sweep's is: a helper
# taking the name as $1 would hide it from the guard
# that reads this file for where a model path is published (ModelDownloadPinningGuardTest
# .noModelPathReachesAGlobalPropertyExceptBehindTheLibrarysVerifiedLedger).
#
# Every step's status is read, and then the two optional=false values are read back. What the suite
# pins is that SOME status is read: turn every `|| _wd_issued=no` here into `|| true` and
# EntrypointRetrievalWiringTest.theUnverifiedCopyIsPutOutOfReachWhenTheDatabaseCouldNotBeReached,
# .theUnverifiedCopyIsPutOutOfReachWhenTheMariadbClientIsAbsent and
# .theDiagnosisStaysTheLastStartsWhereThisStartCouldNotWriteIt go red, because a read-back alone
# answers empty for a database that could not be asked at all — the same answer a withdrawn row
# gives, fail-open in the one direction this whole gate exists to close. No step is pinned on its
# own, though: discard the UPDATEs' status, or the reads', or the -z tests on this function's last
# line, and nothing reds: on every branch these cases drive, what is left still
# answers. They all stay anyway, since a discarded UPDATE error is what let the start go on
# saying "its paths are blanked" over a row that still named the file — but on what is driven they
# are defence in depth over each other rather than separate detectors, and no case tells them
# apart. configure_retrieval_gps acts on the answer.
#
# Every UPDATE is ISSUED before any status is acted on. Chained with `|| return 1` the vocab's
# UPDATE was never issued on a database that rejected the model path's, so a store that would have
# taken it kept a row naming half an embedder this start did not verify — and querystore resolves the
# vocab with optional=false too. One statement's rejection is no verdict on the next. On a database
# that is not answering, each statement here costs its own connect timeout, which is the same order
# as the reads and writes below this call already pay on that path.
#
# The third row is querystore's query encoder, `querystore.embedding.queryModelFilePath`. querystore
# resolves it with optional=true, nothing in this repository writes it, and a start that verifies
# leaves it alone — so a start that verifies never puts a value there for this to take back. What
# reaches it is a deployment that pointed it at the file these fetches write to: on a refusal that
# deletes nothing the copy is still on the volume, the quarantine does not run where the withdrawal
# lands, and querystore opens an ONNX session over bytes this start refused, which is the state #444
# is about. Its statement joins the answer below through the same `_wd_issued`; it is NOT read back,
# and that is residue rather than coverage — a database that takes the statement and leaves the row
# standing is caught for the two rows above and not for this one.

# The instrument that needs no database: take the FILE out of the two names querystore loads, so a
# row this start could not withdraw names nothing loadable — for those two names and no others,
# which the last paragraph below is about. querystore resolves both of these paths with
# optional=false, and ModelFileResolver throws "Model file not found" for a path with no file at it
# exactly as OnnxEmbeddingProvider throws for a blank one — so this leaves querystore in the same
# state a landed withdrawal does, by the other route.
#
# Moved rather than deleted, and for the reason file_bytes will not answer 0 for a file it could not
# measure: code 5 is "this copy could not be hashed", which is a statement about the tools and not
# about the bytes, and deleting on it would re-download the same file every start to delete it
# again. An operator keeps the copy, and the next start finds the target absent and fetches the
# recorded artifact from zero.
#
# BOTH copies go, for the reason the withdrawal blanks every row it reaches when one artifact was
# refused: the gate's unit is the pair, and an embedder without its vocab is not half-configured
# but unusable. Where only one was refused that costs the other a re-download, which is the price of
# the pair being the unit everywhere rather than here alone.
#
# So the lines below, and the suffix, are about the EMBEDDER and never about the bytes of the file
# they name. Two shapes reach here with a copy that verified: one artifact refused and the other
# not, and a verification taken where this shell cannot read it, which refuses nothing at all —
# MODEL_MANIFEST_REFUSED is empty in the second and _embedder_status says so. Calling either copy
# refused would put an operator-facing line at odds with the property beside it.
#
# It reaches LESS far than the withdrawal, and that is worth stating: the withdrawal blanks whatever
# the row names, an operator's own path included, while this reaches only the two targets the fetches
# above wrote to. So a row naming a file this module never provisioned survives this path — which is
# outside #444 either way, its subject being bytes this module fetched.
