# Evaluating a dedicated DDI system prompt

This page records what happened when a dedicated drug-drug interaction (DDI) system prompt was
tried in place of the module's built-in one, and why it made the answers worse. Read it before
proposing another DDI-specific prompt, or before routing DDI questions to a separate prompt.

Companion documents:

- [ddi-question-routing.md](ddi-question-routing.md) explains how a question reaches the
  interaction checks, and what the model does and does not decide. Most of the failures below are
  explained there.

  covers answering from the module's own findings, the alternative that did fix the affected cases.

## The prompt that was tried

It opens with a role statement: *"You are a drug-drug interaction (DDI) safety assistant … A
deterministic knowledge base has ALREADY looked up the interactions …"*. It then sets out:

- the inputs it expects: `proposed_drug`, `active_orders` and `findings`;
- five absolute rules, including "use ONLY the retrieved findings" and "if `findings` is empty, say
  the knowledge base found no interaction";
- a graded verdict, where "Avoid" is only for a true contraindication;
- a consequence tag per interaction: reduced efficacy, toxicity risk or additive risk;
- a mandatory cross-drug synthesis line;
- a fixed output format beginning `Verdict:` and `Checked against active orders: <list>`, ending
  with "What to monitor / do".

The prompt was installed through the `chartsearchai.llm.systemPrompt` global property in place of
`LlmProvider.DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`. Its full text is on its own page:
[ddi-system-prompt-evaluated.md](ddi-system-prompt-evaluated.md).

## Run 1 — 2026-09-24: the prompt against the built-in one

**Setup.** `main` at `bc68da1f`, `chartMode=fullChart`, one patient (Sarah Taylor, `dc8560c9-…`),
and the question *"should i give {drug}?"* over the 14 drugs of
[Decision 84](adr.md#decision-84-where-the-one-line-per-finding-clause-sits-is-what-decides-whether-a-safety-answer-states-every-finding-it-was-given)'s
corpus. Of those 14 cases, 12 have findings and 2 are controls (Lithium, Paracetamol) that should
raise nothing. A pass/fail gate was fixed before the run.

| Arm | What it was |
|---|---|
| **A** | the built-in `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (baseline) |
| **B** | the prompt exactly as written |
| **C** | B plus the built-in prompt's two sentences describing the output format (exploratory) |
| **D** | B with the three fixes below applied |

**Result: B and C fail the gate. D passes it on this corpus only.**

### Why the prompt made the answers worse

**1. It never describes the output format the module requires.** The module forces every answer
into a `{reasoning, answer, citations}` JSON object (`ChartAnswerResponseFormat`), and only
`answer` reaches the `/search` response. The prompt describes a different input and never mentions
that object. Under arm B:

- 9 of the 12 cases with findings answered with a bare "Avoid." or "Use with caution — monitor.",
  with the substance written into `reasoning`, which the response does not carry;
- one case ran to the 4096-token output cap, looping on "*End of report.*", and one was empty;
- 6 of 35 findings were cited, against 29 of 35 for arm A.

This is a mismatch with the module's output format, not with the deterministic layer. Arm C, which
added the two format sentences, restored citation to 29 of 35.

**2. Listing the active orders feeds them back into the checks.** Drugs the answer names are added
to the drugs checked in the post-answer pass (see
[What the model does](ddi-question-routing.md#what-the-model-does)). The prompt's `Checked against
active orders: <list>` line names every active order. Under arm C, each of the two controls raised
**45 chips**, where arm A raised 0.

**3. "No findings" does not mean "checked and found nothing".** The module finds a question's drug
by matching names against the knowledge base
([step 1](ddi-question-routing.md#step-1--does-the-question-name-a-drug)). A name the knowledge base
does not carry resolves to nothing, and nothing is screened. On the run's knowledge base, the
Lithium row was named `Lithium carbonate` (aliases `lithium carbonate` and `Lithobid`), so
*"Lithium"* matched no entry. The same was true of *"Paracetamol"* against the `Acetaminophen` row.
The prompt's rule 3 told the model to read an empty `findings` as a completed check. Under arm C
both controls answered "No interaction found", where arm A said "The records do not address X".
Asked the same day as *"should i give Lithium carbonate?"*, the knowledge base raised one **Major**
chip covering all three of her NSAIDs, with `interactionPairs` `{found: 3}`.

**4. The verdict rules were ignored in favour of the findings' own wording.** The prompt reserves
"Avoid" for a contraindication. None of the chips was a contraindication, yet arm C said "Avoid"
4 times. Its verdicts followed the wording of the injected finding records instead: in 11 of 12
cases with findings it made the same call as arm A. The findings reach the model already worded
([step 3](ddi-question-routing.md#step-3--the-validator-runs-twice-behind-the-same-gate)), and the
model followed that wording over the prompt's rules. Under arm C, one Major case (Aspirin) also got
a caution rather than a refusal.

**5. The prompt contradicts itself.** Rule 1 says "use ONLY the retrieved findings". But the
consequence tags, the cross-drug synthesis and "What to monitor / do" ask for drug knowledge that
no injected record carries. Under arm C, 6 consequence tags contradicted the line they sat on.

Arm C also cost 3.0 times arm A's output tokens and 12 seconds more per answer on average.

### Arm D: the prompt with three fixes

Arm D was the pasted prompt with three changes:

1. the output-format and `[n]` citation sentences from the built-in prompt;
2. a finding-less drug with no reference record is "not screened", not "no interaction found";
3. no listing of the active orders.

On the same 14 cases plus two added screened-nothing cases (Mebendazole, Amoxicillin), it
**passed** the same gate:

| Measure | Arm A | Arm D |
|---|---|---|
| Findings cited, of 35 | 29 | 34 |
| Cases stating fewer findings than they were given | 3 | 1 |
| Ratings dropped | 1 | 0 |
| Severity misstatements | not recorded | 0 |
| Call class matching arm A, of 12 cases with findings | (baseline) | 12 |
| Chips on the controls | 0 | 0 |
| Mean output tokens | 359 | 826 |
| Misspelled drug-name tokens | 3 | 5 |

In arm D, all 5 Major cases answered "Avoid" and all 7 Moderate or Minor cases a caution. It also
added about 15.6 seconds per answer on the Metal rig.

**Still open after run 1:**

- The run covered one patient, one phrasing and proposal questions only. No screening question was
  tested, and screening questions are the ones `isInteractionScreening` would route to such a
  prompt.
- The "Avoid only for a contraindication" rule was still ignored, so the prompt still contradicts
  itself.
- "What to monitor / do" is the model's own advice, which no record carries.

### Arm D on other question types

The same patient was asked seven other kinds of question under arms A, B and D. Arm D:

- opened a "should I stop" question with "Use with caution — monitor, for the proposed drug". It
  has no wording for a medication she is already taking;
- rated allergy findings "major" or "moderate", although every allergy chip is an unrated
  contraindication;
- refused *"most recent vital signs?"* outright.

In the same run, arm B's listing of the active orders inflated the chip count for Mebendazole
(45 against arm A's 0), Lithium carbonate (28 against 1) and a medication-list question (22 against
10).

**So a prompt like arm D could only ever serve proposal questions**, and routing any other question
to it makes that answer worse.

## Run 2 — 2026-09-25: perturbing the built-in prompt

**Setup.** `main` at `69f7b5ee`, 17 cases each run twice per arm: cases from the worked examples
doc plus one case per issue under test. The prompt global property was swapped per arm. An A/A
control (the property unset, against the property holding the default text) gave 34 of 34
byte-identical answers, so the noise floor was 0.

**Every prompt arm failed the gate.** Each was a targeted edit to `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` for
issues #539, #337 and #402, and each dropped findings in some case: on #402's case, the findings
cited fell from 7 to 2. One arm fixed #539's case only by deleting the mechanism text, and dropped
"Major" with it.

**What did fix the affected cases was taking the model out of them.** With
`chartsearchai.drugSafety.answerFromFindings=true`
([Decision 108](adr.md#decision-108-a-drug-safety-question-the-module-resolved-itself-is-answered-from-its-own-findings-and-the-model-is-not-asked-to-restate-them)),
the cases the module composed itself stated every finding with its rating, and every Major hazard
word for word. That fixed #539's case, one of #541's cases, and #399's case (recorded as "10-of-20"). The cases the model still answered were byte-identical to the baseline. That
property defaulted to `false` then; it ships `true` since #562 ([Decision 131](adr.md#decision-131-answerfromfindings-ships-on-because-decision-108s-gate-was-run)).

---

## What this means for the next attempt

- **In both runs the model followed the records over the prompt.** The findings, their wording and
  their ratings reach the model as records, and where the prompt's rules disagreed with them, the
  records won. To change what a finding says, change how the module writes it, not the prompt.
- **A prompt must keep the module's output format.** It must describe the
  `{reasoning, answer, citations}` object and the `[n]` citations. Without them the answer is lost,
  whatever else the prompt does well.
- **A prompt must not list the patient's orders in the answer.** Every drug the answer names is
  checked again.
- **A prompt must not treat an empty finding list as a completed check.** An unrecognised drug name
  produces no findings too. On a screening question, the module does state an empty screen itself
  ([Decision 87](adr.md#decision-87-a-screen-that-related-nothing-says-so-in-the-prompt-instead-of-reaching-the-model-as-an-empty-slice)),
  but that covers the screening check only.
- **Re-run against the built-in prompt's capture, with a gate fixed in advance, before proposing
  any prompt change.** Every perturbation measured so far dropped findings somewhere.
