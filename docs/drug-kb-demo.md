# Drug knowledge base — demo setup

A reproducible setup for demonstrating the drug-reference / drug-safety feature on an
OpenMRS standalone (or any RefApp demo database). It creates one dedicated test patient
with the allergies, conditions and active drug orders needed to trigger each warning,
adds the ATC concept mappings the class-based paths need, and (for the cross-reactivity
path) swaps in a small custom knowledge base.

> The table below covered every path when it was written and no longer does: three arms
> have landed since — the question-named pair lookup
> ([#114](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/114)), the
> interaction screen ([#113](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/113))
> and the active-order contraindication join
> ([#143](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/143), which can fire
> on this seeded patient, on the questions the note above the cheat-sheet names). The README's GP
> table is the authoritative list of what the feature does; this document is only the demo data.

For the feature itself — config reference, design, API/SSE shape — see the
[README "Drug-reference injection & safety validation"](../README.md#drug-reference-injection--safety-validation)
section and [ADR Decisions 23 & 24](adr.md). This document is only the **demo data**.

> All seeded rows use UUIDs prefixed `dkb` so the teardown can find them. The numeric
> `concept_id`s in `atc_drugkb.sql` (114/118/122/3923) are from the RefApp demo DB — see

## What it lets you demonstrate

| # | Path | How it fires |
|---|------|--------------|
| 1 | Question-driven injection | a KB drug name/alias in the question → a `drug_reference` citation is injected |
| 2 | Contraindication — allergy | patient allergy token matches a KB contraindication (coded + non-coded) |
| 3 | Contraindication — condition | patient condition token matches a KB contraindication (coded + non-coded) |
| 4 | Contraindication — "recorded allergy to X" (ATC class) | allergy resolves to the very drug asked about. **Not reachable on the seeded allergies since [#146](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/146)**: where the KB also carries an allergy rule *naming that drug* the two are ONE chip and the rule's note is the wording kept, and both seeded allergens that resolve to a bundled entry (Ibuprofen, Paracetamol) have such a rule. To see this path's own wording, record an allergy to **Gentamicin** — the one bundled entry whose allergy rule names a class rather than itself |
| 5 | Interaction — active order | a patient's active order matches a KB interaction token |
| 6 | Interaction — duplicate therapy (ATC class) | an active order shares the asked drug's ATC level-4 subgroup |
| 7 | Order-driven injection | a reference is injected from an active order (needs `injectFromQuery=false` to see in isolation) |
| 8 | Cross-reactivity (ATC class) | an allergy to a *different* drug in the same ATC subgroup as the asked drug — one whose own published name names chemistry or a molecular target, not merely a purpose ([Decision 34](adr.md#decision-34-an-atc-subgroup-licenses-only-the-claim-its-own-name-asserts)) |
| 9 | Overdose | the answer states a dose above the KB maximum (LLM-output dependent — see [caveat](#overdose-caveat)) |

This demo runs against the **curated** KB, which has four drugs: **ibuprofen** (`M01AE01`),
**paracetamol** (`N02BE01`), **amoxicillin** (`J01CA04`), **gentamicin** (`J01GB03`).

> **That is no longer the module's default**, so Step 1 selects it explicitly. Since
> [ADR Decision 36](adr.md#decision-36-the-shipped-default-is-the-whole-ddinter-knowledge-base) the
> default is the whole DDInter knowledge base (2283 substances), which publishes interactions only —
> so on the default, paths 2, 3 and 9 have no data to fire on (no hand-authored allergy/condition
> rules, no dose ceilings) while paths 1, 5, 6, 7 and 8 fire far more widely than this seed can
> illustrate. The four curated drugs are still the dataset that exercises every path in one place,
> which is why this document pins them.

Paths 1–7 work against the curated
KB — except path 4, which since [#146](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/146) needs an allergy the seed does not carry (see its row above); path 8 needs the [custom KB](#step-4-cross-reactivity-custom-kb) (it adds Naproxen,
`M01AE02`, sharing ibuprofen's subgroup).

---

## Prerequisites

- A running standalone with the chartsearchai module (these examples assume
  `http://localhost:8081/openmrs` with the bundled MariaDB on port `3316`).
- The bundled MariaDB client, e.g. `./database/bin/mariadb -h127.0.0.1 -P3316 -uroot openmrs`.
- REST calls below use **cookie-jar auth** — basic-auth alone loses the session mid-sequence:

  ```bash
  J=cookies.txt; AUTH='admin:Admin123'; BASE=http://localhost:8081/openmrs/ws/rest/v1
  curl -s -u "$AUTH" -c $J "$BASE/session" -o /dev/null   # establish session
  gp(){ curl -s -u "$AUTH" -b $J -c $J -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -X POST "$BASE/systemsetting/$1" -d "{\"value\":\"$2\"}" -w " $1=$2 [%{http_code}]\n" -o /dev/null; }
  ```

> The stock RefApp demo DB has **0 allergies and 0 drug orders**, so without this seed the
> patient-driven paths have nothing to act on even with the feature enabled.

---

## Step 1 — enable the feature

The master switch gates everything: `DrugSafetyValidator` and `DrugReferenceInjector` both
short-circuit to empty when it is `false`, regardless of `validateAnswers`.

```bash
gp chartsearchai.drugReference.enabled true
# the curated four-drug KB, which is what every path below is written against.
# NOT the default any more (that is the whole DDInter knowledge base) — see the note above.
gp chartsearchai.drugReference.sourceFormat json
# these default to true already; shown for completeness
gp chartsearchai.drugSafety.validateAnswers true
gp chartsearchai.drugReference.injectFromQuery true
```

---

## Step 2 — seed the test patient (`seed_drugkb.sql`)

Creates **Margaret Holloway** (UUID `dkb00000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`), an adult so the
adult dose bands apply. Idempotent — re-running wipes and recreates. Run with:

```bash
./database/bin/mariadb -h127.0.0.1 -P3316 -uroot openmrs < seed_drugkb.sql
```

## Step 3 — ATC mappings for the class-based paths (`atc_drugkb.sql`)

Adds WHO-ATC mappings to real, correctly-classified concepts plus four more active orders, so
the **duplicate-therapy** (path 6) and **order-driven injection** (path 7) paths can fire.
Path 7 no longer needs the ATC **mappings** since [#151](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/151)
— an order is recognised by any name it carries too (its coded drug's, a clinician's free text, or its concept's), and the class relationship the path tests comes from
the KB entries' own ATC codes — though it still needs this script's Amoxicillin order. Path 6 still
needs the mappings: the duplicate-therapy chip resolves a co-medication from the **order's** ATC codes,
so an unmapped concept raises none.
Ampicillin (`J01CA01`) is a sibling of amoxicillin (`J01CA04`); Amikacin (`J01GB06`) a sibling
of gentamicin (`J01GB03`). Run **after** the seed:

```bash
./database/bin/mariadb -h127.0.0.1 -P3316 -uroot openmrs < atc_drugkb.sql
```

```sql
-- ============================================================================

--   * order-driven injection                 -- Amoxicillin/Gentamicin own-code orders
-- Maps real, correctly-classified WHO-ATC codes onto real concepts. Idempotent.

## Step 4 — cross-reactivity custom KB

> **What "the knowledge base" is.** The knowledge base is the **drug dataset** the feature
> reads — drug entries with aliases, ATC codes, age-banded doses, and interaction/contraindication
> rules. It is *data*, not logic: the code that injects citations, parses doses, and derives the
> ATC-class warnings lives in the module, not in the file. The active dataset comes from one of
> two sources:
> - **Bundled** — a dataset shipped inside the module and used when no override is configured. There
>   are two: `ddi-knowledge-base.json`, the whole DDInter knowledge base, which
>   `sourceFormat=ddinter` selects and which is the module's default; and `drug-reference.json`, the
>   curated four drugs above, which `sourceFormat=json` selects and which Step 1 sets because this
>   document is written against it.
> - **External override** — any file `chartsearchai.drugReference.dataFilePath` points at (within
>   the app-data directory). When set, it **replaces** the bundled dataset entirely — it does
>   **not** merge with it. So a custom file must contain *all* the drugs you want, not just the
>   additions.
>
> `drug-reference-custom.json` below is such an override (the bundled four **plus** Naproxen);
> while `dataFilePath` points at it, it *is* the live knowledge base and the bundled one is
> dormant. Clearing the GP (and restarting) reverts to the bundled dataset. *(A third option:
> `sourceFormat=atc` reads a WHO-ATC classification export instead of JSON — classification only,
> no hand-authored rules; `json` is the curated, rule-bearing KB and the only one carrying doses.)*

Cross-reactivity (path 8) needs two KB drugs sharing an ATC subgroup that names chemistry or a molecular target — a purpose-named one such as `S01AA` "Antibiotics" licenses path 6 and not path 8 ([Decision 34](adr.md#decision-34-an-atc-subgroup-licenses-only-the-claim-its-own-name-asserts)). The bundled four are all
in different subgroups, so this path is unreachable by patient data alone. Extend the KB via
the external-file mechanism (no rebuild):

1. Copy a KB file with the extra drug to `<application-data-directory>/drug-reference-custom.json`.
   A ready-made one is committed alongside this doc at [`docs/drug-reference-custom.json`](drug-reference-custom.json)
   (the bundled four **plus** Naproxen) — just copy it into the app-data dir. Equivalently, copy the
   bundled `api/src/main/resources/chartsearchai/drug-reference.json` and append this fifth entry
   (Naproxen shares ibuprofen's `M01AE` subgroup; it carries **no** contraindications/interactions
   of its own, so on the committed seed the cross-reactivity warning is the only chip a naproxen query
   raises *about naproxen*. Where the Aspirin order is `N02BA`-mapped — as the long-lived `:8081`
   instance is, see [Portability](#portability) — a second naproxen chip appears, the NSAID group
   against that active order, exactly as it does for ibuprofen. And this custom KB still carries the
   bundled four, so Margaret's own active orders still raise the three chips the
   [cheat-sheet note](#query-cheat-sheet) describes):

   ```json
   {
     "id": "naproxen",
     "name": "Naproxen",
     "drugClass": "NSAID",
     "aliases": ["naproxen", "naprosyn", "aleve"],
     "atcCodes": ["M01AE02"],
     "ageBands": [
       { "minYears": 12, "maxYears": 120, "mgPerKgMin": 5, "mgPerKgMax": 10, "maxDailyDoseMg": 1000 }
     ],
     "interactions": [],
     "contraindications": [],
     "source": "WHO ATC classification (test entry: shares M01AE subgroup with ibuprofen)"
   }
   ```

2. Point the GP at it and **restart** (the KB is cached in-process; it only reloads on restart):

   ```bash
   gp chartsearchai.drugReference.dataFilePath drug-reference-custom.json
   # then restart the standalone / module
   ```

---

## Knowledge base entry schema

Reference for authoring a custom KB (the `json` source format). The top-level file is
`{ "version": ..., "source": ..., "description": ..., "entries": [ ... ] }` — `version` /
`source` / `description` are informational; `entries` is the array of drug objects below.

**Per-drug entry**

| Field | Type | Read by | Purpose / notes |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| `id` | string | injection | **Required** — an entry with a blank `id` is dropped at load (it has no stable citation `resourceUuid`). Keep unique (e.g. `naproxen`). |
| `name` | string | injection, validator | **Required** — an entry with a blank `name` is dropped at load (it would render a null display name). Shown in the injected reference and in `safetyWarnings[].drug`. |
| `drugClass` | string | injection | Human-readable class label rendered in the reference text (e.g. "NSAID"). Informational only — class **logic** uses `atcCodes`, not this. |
| `aliases` | string[] | injection, validator | Lowercase names matched **whole-word, case-insensitive** against the question and the answer ("advil" matches "is advil safe?"; "amox" won't spuriously match). Drives question-driven injection and which drug a warning is attributed to. |
| `atcCodes` | string[] | injection, validator | WHO-ATC codes. Used two ways: **exact code** → order-driven injection (or, since [#151](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/151), any name the order carries — its coded drug's, a clinician's free text, or its concept's) / interaction match against an active order's ATC; **level-4 prefix** (`M01AE01` → `M01AE`) → the class-based cross-reactivity & duplicate-therapy checks. Two drugs are "same class" when their level-4 subgroups intersect in a subgroup that classifies the substances — a residual bucket ATC fills by exclusion inside a group it defines by site of application, and everything under `V03A`/`V07A`, are skipped (issue #167; see `DrugReference.isUnclassifyingAtcCode`) — since #184 so are six residues whose ancestry asserts nothing at any level, and since #183 the cross-reactivity arm alone skips 117 further subgroups whose names state only a purpose (`DrugReference.isPurposeOnlyAtcCode`). |
| `ageBands` | object[] | injection, overdose | Age-banded dosing (below). The band whose range contains the patient's age is selected; **no matching band → no numeric dosing rendered and no overdose check** (this is the age-gating that stops a pediatric max being shown for an adult). |
| `warnings` | string[] | injection | Optional free-text prose warnings (e.g. a Reye-syndrome caution) rendered verbatim into the injected, citable record so the LLM can ground and cite them. **Display-only** — no matchable token, so the validator never fires on them; enforceable facts belong in the rule fields. |
| `interactions` | object[] | interaction warning | Drug–drug interaction rules (below). |
| `contraindications` | object[] | contraindication warning | Allergy/condition rules (below). |
| `source` | string | injection | Dataset attribution for the entry. **Never rendered into the reference text the LLM sees** — it is published as the `source` field on every citation of this entry, for a client to show beside the citation. It used to be appended to the citable record, and the model recited it into clinician-facing answers (issue #117). Blank or whitespace-only is published as `null`. |
| `genericName` | string, optional | Everyday generic synonym appended to safety-chip labels when it genuinely diverges from `name` (neither containing the other) — `"Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin)"`. Display only: never rendered into the reference text the LLM sees, never used for matching. A redundant value (equal to, containing, or contained in `name`) is ignored. |

**`ageBands[]` object**

| Field | Type | Purpose / notes |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| `minYears`, `maxYears` | number | Inclusive age range (years) the band applies to. |
| `mgPerKgMin`, `mgPerKgMax` | number | Per-dose mg/kg range rendered in the reference text. `mgPerKgMax` also drives the **weight-aware per-dose overdose check**: with a fresh weight on record (see the `weightConceptUuid` / `weightMaxAgeDays` GPs), a per-administration dose above `mgPerKgMax` × weight is flagged. |
| `maxDailyDoseMg` | number | Daily maximum for the overdose check. **`0` is a sentinel meaning "no published maximum"** — dosing is still rendered and the daily arm stays silent for that band, though the weight-aware per-dose arm still runs when `mgPerKgMax` is set. The overdose parser reads the literal unit `mg` only (grams are not flagged). |

**`interactions[]` object**

| Field | Type | Purpose / notes |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| `token` | string | Matched (case-insensitive) against the patient's active-order drug names by **word start**, tolerating up to two trailing letters so localized spellings still match (issue #86): `iron` matches `Iron IR 325mg` and `aspirin` matches the French `Aspirine Co 81mg`, but `iron` does **not** match `Spironolactone`. Write the token as the drug's own name, not a fragment of it. |
| `atc` | string | ATC code matched against the active order's ATC mapping (an alternative to `token`). |
| `note` | string | Free text appended to the interaction warning (e.g. "increased risk of GI bleeding"). |
| `severity` | string, optional | Source-assigned rating (`Unknown`/`Minor`/`Moderate`/`Major`). **Rating a rule opts it into the severity floor** (`chartsearchai.drugSafety.minInteractionSeverity`, default `minor`): a rule rated below the floor raises no warning. Omit it (the usual case for hand-authored rules) and the rule always fires. **Whatever you write here is published verbatim** to clients as `safetyWarnings[].severity` ([#340](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/340)) — the module neither normalizes it nor checks it against a vocabulary, and a word outside the four above is treated internally exactly as an omitted one, i.e. as unrated. So write one of the four unless you mean "unrated", and remember that this field and the rule's `note` are independent: nothing makes the note you author agree with the rating you set. |

**`contraindications[]` object**

| Field | Type | Purpose / notes |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| `type` | string | Must be exactly `allergy` or `condition` — selects whether `token` is matched against the patient's **allergies** or **active conditions**. |
| `token` | string | Substring matched (case-insensitive) against that patient data (e.g. `nsaid`, `peptic ulcer`). |
| `note` | string | Free text shown in the contraindication warning. |

> The hand-authored `interactions` / `contraindications` rules are **additive** to the ATC
> class-based checks: with only `atcCodes` (and no rules), the validator still derives
> cross-reactivity and duplicate-therapy warnings from ATC class membership — which is how the
> rule-less `atc` source format produces warnings at all.

## Cross-reactivity groups file schema

A second, independent data file (`chartsearchai.drugReference.crossReactivityGroupsFilePath`,
bundled fallback `cross-reactivity-groups.json`) loaded alongside **any** source format (`json`, `atc` and `ddinter` alike). It
carries the cross-*branch* family knowledge ATC's tree cannot express (ADR Decision 27). The
top-level file is `{ "version": ..., "description": ..., "groups": [ ... ] }`.

**`groups[]` object**

| Field | Type | Purpose / notes |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| `name` | string | Family name shown in the warning (e.g. `NSAID`). |
| `note` | string | Informational — documents why the group exists; not rendered in warnings. |
| `atcPrefixes` | string[] | ATC code prefixes, **any level** (`M01AE`, `N02BA`, or broader like `M01A`) — the data chooses each family's breadth. A drug is a member when any of its `atcCodes` starts with any prefix. |

Two drugs sharing a group — but **no** ATC level-4 subgroup (the more specific match always
wins, one warning per fact) — raise cross-reactivity contraindications against allergies and
additive / duplicate-class interaction warnings against active orders, and make an active order
relevant enough for its reference to be injected on a related question. The bundled seed is one
NSAID group spanning `M01AE` + `N02BA` (the aspirin↔ibuprofen case) — expand per deployment.
Editing the file takes effect on the next module restart (same lazy-cache contract as the
entry dataset).

> **Not exercised by this demo's seed (Decision 27 additions).** The cheat-sheet below predates
> the weight-aware per-dose check and the cross-branch group path, and the seed gives Margaret
> neither a weight obs nor an `N02BA`-mapped order — so neither new mechanism fires here (both
> are pinned by `evals/drug-reference/drug-safety-eval.json` and the context tests). To see them
> live: record a recent Weight (kg) obs for the patient and ask a per-dose question (e.g.
> *"Can she take ibuprofen 600 mg every 8 hours?"* — flags once the stated dose exceeds
> `mgPerKgMax` × weight; note the overdose arms read the dose from the **answer**, so use the
> "repeat back the proposed order" phrasing from the [overdose caveat](#overdose-caveat) on a
> clean patient), and map the Aspirin concept to ATC `N02BA01` for the cross-branch group chip.
> The committed `atc_drugkb.sql` maps only the J01CA/J01GB antibiotics, but the long-lived
> :8081 instance **already carries** an `N02BA01` mapping on Aspirin — live-verified 2026-07-10:
> the ibuprofen query there shows an extra *"Ibuprofen is in the same cross-reactivity group
> (NSAID) as active order N02BA01 — possible additive or duplicate-class therapy"* chip (the
> bare code appeared because no KB entry carries `N02BA01`; wording as of the sentence-detail
> refactor — the 2026-07-10 capture predates the leading subject). **Issue #155 has since removed
> the bare code from that chip**: the partner is named by the dataset's entry, else by the ORDER's
> own display name, and only then by the code. What that produces for this exact configuration is
> pinned by `ClassChipPartnerLabelTest.anOrderTheDatasetDoesNotCoverIsNamedByItsOwnDisplayName`,
> which drives the real bundled seed through the real validator — read the assertion there rather
> than trusting this paragraph. The 2026-07-10 capture is left as recorded rather than rewritten,
> because it is what was measured that day. Both Decision-27 paths were live-verified end-to-end that day
> (weight arm: `~1000 mg exceeds the 15 mg/kg per-dose maximum (~750 mg) … weight 50 kg`,
> driven by the bundled CIEL default with no GP row).

## Query cheat-sheet

Run on **Margaret Holloway** (`dkb00000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`) unless noted.

> **Since [#143](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/143) a query need
> NOT surface only the warnings for the drug it names.** This patient's own active orders are also
> checked against her own allergies and conditions, so a row below can carry chips about drugs the
> query never mentions. **Which rows, since the subject-matter scoping of that arm, depends on the
> question**: the chips appear where either side of one is part of what the response is about — the
> drug or the recorded finding named by the question, the answer or a record the answer cited — and a
> question in the medication, allergy or condition domain keeps the corresponding list in scope
> wholesale. Off-topic questions get none of them, which is the whole point of the scoping; see the
> per-row note under the table. (The last row is scoped to any patient; on a stock demo patient, who
> has neither an allergy nor a condition, the arm returns before it looks at any order.) With the
> bundled KB and **Steps 1-3 run**, two of her orders resolve to an entry her own records
> contraindicate, and they can contribute three chips:
>
> - **Amoxicillin** (`DKB-ORD-6`) — its curated `penicillin` rule against her seeded penicillin-class
>   allergy (`162297…`, which the table above calls *Penicillins* and the current demo DB names
>   *Penicillin drug class*; the rule is matched by containment, so either name hits):
>   `Amoxicillin is contraindicated by an active allergy: penicillin-class hypersensitivity`.
> - **Gentamicin** (`DKB-ORD-8`) — twice, off her non-coded *Aminoglycoside* allergy and her
>   *Significant renal impairment*.
>
> **No row in the table below carries these three as extras any more.** A query that NAMES one of the
> two drugs puts that entry in play, the arm skips an entry already in play, and the chip comes from
> the drug-in-play loop instead — which is what the row's own stated expectation already covers, so
> the amoxicillin row shows its penicillin chip once and not twice. What it does NOT pick up is the
> other drug's chips: *Is amoxicillin safe for this patient?* carries no medication, allergy or
> condition cue and names neither *gentamicin*, *aminoglycoside* nor *renal impairment*, so nothing
> puts that order or those findings in the response's subject matter, and the two Gentamicin chips
> are absent. The gentamicin row loses the Amoxicillin one for the mirror-image reason. So do the
> rows naming neither: *Can this patient take paracetamol?*, *Can this patient take ibuprofen?* and
> *Is naproxen safe for this patient?*. In every case the escape hatch is the same — if the model's
> answer or a record it cites happens to name one of those drugs or findings, that side is in subject
> matter and the chip returns, so a run may show more than the row promises.
>
> That is the scoping working, not a broken deployment. To demonstrate the arm deliberately, ask a
> medication-domain question that names no drug — *"What are her current medications?"* — which keeps
> her whole active-order list in scope and brings all three back. *"Does she have any allergies?"*
> brings back the two that rest on an allergy, and *"What conditions does she have?"* the renal one.
>
> Her Warfarin, Aspirin, Methotrexate, Furosemide, Ampicillin and Amikacin orders resolve to no
> bundled entry, so they add nothing. Note **how** Gentamicin resolves: `DKB-ORD-8` is on
> `concept_id` 3923, and Step 3 maps that concept to `J01GB03`, which is the bundled Gentamicin
> entry's own ATC code — so the ORDER-driven matcher finds the entry by code, whatever the concept is
> named. On a database where 3923 is not Gentamicin (see the `concept_id` caveat in
> [Portability](#portability); it is Gemfibrozil on the standalone this note was checked against)
> those two chips still appear and still say *Gentamicin*, naming a substance the order does not
> display — a seed-data mismatch, not a module one, and a reason to re-derive the ids before
> demonstrating. Note also that **both** contraindicated orders are created by Step 3, not Step 2
> (`atc_drugkb.sql` inserts `DKB-ORD-5..8`; Step 2's `DKB-ORD-1..4` are Warfarin, Aspirin,
> Methotrexate and Furosemide, none of which the bundled KB carries) — so after Steps 1-2 alone this
> arm contributes nothing at all.
>
> That is the point of the fix: an allergy to a drug she is already taking is a prescribing error the
> chart already contains, and the ANSWER's wording alone should not hide it — a prescribed drug turns
> up in a cited `drug_order` record, which is exactly what echo scoping was reading as a recitation.
> What the module deliberately no longer does is announce it on a response about something else; that
> finding needs a surface of its own, which is `GET /chartsearchai/chartalerts`
> ([#280](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/280)).

| Query | Expected `safetyWarnings` / injection |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| *Can this patient take ibuprofen?* | injected `ibuprofen`; contraindication — "Ibuprofen is contraindicated by an active allergy: documented ibuprofen allergy" (**one** chip: the curated `ibuprofen` rule and the identity check are one finding since [#146](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/146)), GI bleed, peptic ulcer — interaction (warfarin, aspirin) — plus, where the Aspirin order is `N02BA`-mapped (the live :8081 instance is), an "Ibuprofen is in the same cross-reactivity group (NSAID)…" interaction |
| *Is amoxicillin safe for this patient?* | injected `amoxicillin`; contraindication (penicillin-class), interaction (methotrexate), **duplicate therapy J01CA** (Ampicillin) |
| *Can this patient take paracetamol?* | injected `paracetamol`; contraindication (severe hepatic), "Paracetamol is contraindicated by an active allergy: documented paracetamol allergy" (one chip — see [#146](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/146)), interaction (warfarin) |
| *Is gentamicin appropriate for this patient?* | injected `gentamicin`; contraindication (aminoglycoside allergy, renal impairment), interaction (furosemide), **duplicate therapy J01GB** (Amikacin) |
| *Is naproxen safe for this patient?* | injected `naproxen`; **cross-reactivity** "Naproxen is in the same ATC class (M01AE) as the patient's allergy to Ibuprofen…" *(needs Step 4)* |
| any KB alias (brufen, advil, panadol, tylenol, amoxil…) on **any** patient | a `drug_reference` citation (question-driven injection needs no patient data) |

**Order-driven injection (path 7)** — set `injectFromQuery=false`, then ask
*"What is the dosing for amoxicillin?"*: the `amoxicillin` reference is still injected (from the
active order), while a drug with no order (e.g. ibuprofen) injects nothing. Restore
`injectFromQuery=true` afterward.

### Overdose caveat

Overdose (path 9) is the only **LLM-output-dependent** path: the validator parses a daily dose
from the *answer* and the parser is deliberately conservative — the dose must appear **in the
same clause as the drug name** and not be preceded by a limit word ("maximum", "up to"…). The
demo patient is *contraindicated* for paracetamol, so the model refuses without restating a
dose — demonstrate overdose on a **clean** patient (one with no paracetamol allergy/condition,
e.g. a stock demo patient) with a phrasing that keeps drug + dose together:

> *"Repeat back the proposed order and state if it is safe: paracetamol 6000 mg daily."*

→ answer "The proposed order is paracetamol 6000 mg daily…" → `overdose: The stated Paracetamol
dose ~6000 mg/day exceeds the 4000 mg/day maximum for ages 12-120`. (Phrasings where the model writes the drug and the dose in
*separate* sentences will not fire, even when the arithmetic is right.)

## Driving the UI (Playwright)

`ask_chart_ui.mjs` logs into the SPA, opens a patient chart, clicks **Ask AI**, submits a
question, waits for a match, and screenshots. Usage:

```bash
node ask_chart_ui.mjs "<question>" "<wait-regex>" "<screenshot-path>" "<patient-uuid>"
# e.g. cross-reactivity on the demo patient:
node ask_chart_ui.mjs "Is naproxen safe for this patient?" "cross-reactivity" out.png
# e.g. overdose on a clean patient:
node ask_chart_ui.mjs "Repeat back the proposed order and state if it is safe: paracetamol 6000 mg daily." \
  "overdose|exceeds" out.png <clean-patient-uuid>
```

```js
import pw from 'playwright';           // adjust to your Playwright install path
const { chromium } = pw;

const BASE = 'http://localhost:8081/openmrs/spa';
const PT = process.argv[5] || 'dkb00000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
const QUESTION = process.argv[2] || 'Is naproxen safe for this patient?';
const MATCH = new RegExp(process.argv[3] || 'cross-reactivity', 'i');
const SHOT = process.argv[4] || 'ask_chart.png';

const log = (...a) => console.log(...a);

const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
const ctx = await browser.newContext({ viewport: { width: 1400, height: 1000 } });
const page = await ctx.newPage();
page.setDefaultTimeout(45000);

try {

  await page.goto(`${BASE}/login`, { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' });

  await launcher.first().click();

  const input = page.getByPlaceholder(/ask ai about this patient/i);
  await input.waitFor({ timeout: 30000 });
  await input.fill(QUESTION);
  log(`→ ask: "${QUESTION}"`);
  const send = page.getByRole('button', { name: /^send$/i });
  if (await send.count()) await send.first().click();
  else await input.press('Enter');

  try {
    await page.getByText(MATCH).first().waitFor({ timeout: 90000 });
    log(`✓ matched "${MATCH.source}"`);
  } catch {
    log(`⚠ no match for "${MATCH.source}" within timeout; capturing anyway`);
  }
  await page.waitForTimeout(2500);

  const bodyText = await page.locator('body').innerText();
  const lines = bodyText.split('\n').map(s => s.trim()).filter(Boolean);
  const interesting = lines.filter(l => /paracetamol|naproxen|amoxicillin|overdose|exceeds|mg\/day|duplicate|therapy|interaction|contraindic|cross-reactivity|safety|reference|maximum/i.test(l));
  log('\n----- on-screen text (filtered) -----');
  interesting.forEach(l => log('  ', l));
  log('-------------------------------------');

  await page.screenshot({ path: SHOT, fullPage: false });
  log(`\n✓ screenshot: ${SHOT}`);
} catch (e) {
  log('ERROR:', e.message);
  await page.screenshot({ path: SHOT, fullPage: false }).catch(() => {});
} finally {
  await browser.close();
}
```

You can also drive everything over REST without a browser —
`POST /ws/rest/v1/chartsearchai/search` with `{"patient": "...", "question": "..."}` returns
`answer`, `references`, and `safetyWarnings`.

## Teardown (`teardown_drugkb.sql`)

Removes the patient, the ATC maps/terms this setup added (leaving pre-existing terms intact),
and clears the custom-KB GP. **Restart** afterward to drop the cached custom KB.

```bash
./database/bin/mariadb -h127.0.0.1 -P3316 -uroot openmrs < teardown_drugkb.sql
# then restart, and set chartsearchai.drugReference.enabled=false to fully restore defaults
```

```sql

## Portability

- **Concept UUIDs** (used by `seed_drugkb.sql`) are stable across RefApp demo databases.
- **Numeric `concept_id`s** in `atc_drugkb.sql` (114 Ampicillin, 118 Amoxicillin, 122 Amikacin,
  3923 Gentamicin) are specific to the loaded demo DB. On a different database, re-derive them:

  ```sql
  SELECT c.concept_id, cn.name FROM concept c
   JOIN concept_name cn ON cn.concept_id=c.concept_id
   WHERE cn.locale='en' AND cn.concept_name_type='FULLY_SPECIFIED'
     AND cn.name IN ('Ampicillin','Amoxicillin','Amikacin','Gentamicin');
  ```

- **`order_type_id=2`** (Drug Order), **`care_setting=1`** (Outpatient), **`location_id=1`**,
  **`encounter_type=3`** (Consultation), **`orderer=1`**, allergen/condition **concept UUIDs**,
  and **identifier_type=3** (OpenMRS ID) are all from the stock RefApp demo metadata — verify if
  your distro differs. The OpenMRS ID value needs a valid idgen Luhn-mod-30 check digit.
- **Gotcha:** the stock RefApp demo DB has 0 allergies and 0 drug orders out of the box; this
  seed is what makes the patient-driven paths demonstrable.
