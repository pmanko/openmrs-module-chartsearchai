# Tier B: 12 inference probes (is she hypertensive / diabetic / anemic) adjudicated from
# the DB (encounter_diagnosis + condition + obs coded/text sweeps, 2026-07-21): YES-expected
# cells have an explicit condition AND encounter-diagnosis record naming the topic;
# NO-expected cells have zero matching records anywhere. Expected leads live in
# probe_gold_yesno.json. Keys are uuid__probe-<topic>.json (absent from metric_gold, so
# metric_score.py skips them). Includes the motivating Betty "?"-twin pair
# (probe-hypertensive vs probe-hypertensive-qmark): the original punctuation-divergence bug,
# and since #315 one yes/no MEDICATIONS cell on the 3.7.1 standalone cohort — see the comment

# above, or the same arm re-fired after a GP swap — inherits the previous run's marker, and fire()
# keeps the previous run's good cells (the failed body goes to .err). So a wholesale failure left the

#
# Placed HERE, below both refusals above and above the first fire, rather than at the top of the

# firing changes nothing in this directory, so there is nothing to fail closed about. At the top it
# also destroyed a COMPLETE arm's marker on a caller error (a mistyped CAPTURE_TIER_B, or
# CAPTURE_PATIENTS=none with Tier B off), and compare_arms.py then exits 3 on that arm until every
# one of its ~190 cells is re-fired. Nothing is fired between the refusals and this line, so the

# Completeness MARKER FILE, not only a log line. compare_arms.py — the scorer this script's
# captures are A/B'd with — reads $OUT/CAPTURE_DONE to tell a finished arm from one killed
# midway (score_probe_safety.py reads its own arm's; score_directness.py reads no marker and
# only names this one in a comment, so do not cite it as a consumer) — a partial arm still
# produces a full-looking table over a biased prefix. This script printed the words and wrote no
# file, so every A/B ever run on its captures reported "no CAPTURE_DONE in the baseline arm ...
# candidate arm" and exited 3: an integrity signal that is always on is one nobody can read,
# which is #178's constant-column defect in another instrument. Written the way
# capture_probe_safety.sh writes its own — the INTENDED cell count, so the body can DISAGREE with
# the directory it sits in and a shortfall is legible in the marker itself.
#
# And refused outright where nothing landed. A marker derived only from `ls "$OUT"/*.json` cannot
# contradict the capture, so an arm that failed wholesale — standalone down, wrong port or auth,
# or the cohort mismatch the README's "standalone gold is unremappable" note describes — wrote
# `cells=0` and compare_arms.py read it as a complete, clean A/B: "cells compared: 0, class
# flips: 0", exit 0. That is a fail-open this script did not have before the marker existed (the
# absent file made exit 3 unconditional), so the marker carries the guard the file's absence used
# to carry: no landed cell, no marker, non-zero exit. That invariant needs the clear above the fire
# loop as well as the refusal here — the refusal alone leaves a PREVIOUS run's marker standing
# over a re-capture that landed nothing, which is the same fail-open one directory older. A partial
# resume needs no separate treatment for the same reason: the clear plus the unconditional write
# below mean the marker in this directory is always the one THIS run wrote, so a resume that lands
