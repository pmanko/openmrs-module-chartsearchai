"""Same-environment A/B over two capture directories: per-cell verdict-lead
classification (score_directness.classify — the versioned metric definition)
diffed between a baseline arm and a candidate arm.

THIS IS A REPORT, NOT A GATE. It has no pass/fail threshold and never had one, and
its exit 0 means "the two captures were readable", not "the candidate is good". The
docstring below has always said interpretation is manual; #179 recorded that the
distinction was being lost anyway, because a script that prints a score and exits 0
reads like a gate to anything automated. So the exit code now carries integrity only
(see below) and the final line says which it is. Do not cite this script's numbers as
a verdict; cite the flips you read.

Built for the #107 verdict-guard gate (2026-07-29), where the human F1/drift
gold proved unremappable (the 3.7.1 standalone's demo DB is a different
synthetic cohort — see the README's "3.7.1 cohort" note) and the strongest
available instrument was a pure-prompt A/B: two builds differing ONLY in the
change under test, identical patients/queries/GPs, captured with
capture_probe_yesno.sh (CAPTURE_PATIENTS=... CAPTURE_TIER_B=0).

Usage: compare_arms.py <baseline_capture_dir> <candidate_capture_dir>
       compare_arms.py --selftest

Reports, over the cells present in BOTH arms (medications cells excluded —
wh-questions are never verdict-scored): the verdict-class distribution per
arm, TWO lead-rate lines (see below), every class flip with answer
snippets for manual reading, and any "records do not address" leads in the
candidate arm — the #107 guard's template, whose appearance on presence
topics would mean the guard bled beyond its safety/suitability scope.

TWO rates, because this file used to print one under both names. The single line it
printed was labelled "directness (verdict-led / scored)" and counted YES+NO+CANNOT,
which is `score_directness`'s DIRECTNESS but NOT `score_probe_safety`'s VERDICT-LED —
that scorer excludes CANNOT on purpose ("a hedge, not a verdict, and must not score as
the goal state"). Two live definitions sharing one label is how #107's quoted
"62/64 vs 63/64" became unattributable: the figure is reproducible under the directness
definition and unknown under the other, and those captures are gone. Both are printed
now, separately named, so neither definition can hide inside the other and an old
number stays comparable to the line it actually came from.

Exit codes, mirroring score_probe_safety's convention (0 clean / 3 integrity):
  0  both arms read cleanly — the flips below are worth reading
  3  integrity problems, printed above the numbers: a missing CAPTURE_DONE (a killed
     run still yields a full-looking table over a biased prefix), or a cell that would
     not parse. The numbers are STILL printed for a human, but an unreadable cell
     classifies as NONE and stays in the denominator, so a partial capture reads as a
     directness drop that no prompt change caused.

Interpretation is manual by design: single-sample captures carry decode
nondeterminism, so read each flip (opposite-direction flips on borderline
topics are the noise floor; same-direction, same-form clusters are signal).
