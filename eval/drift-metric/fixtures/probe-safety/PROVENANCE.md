# `score_probe_safety.py --selftest` fixtures — where every byte came from

One capture directory per recorded blind spot, each in the exact shape
`capture_probe_safety.sh` writes (one `*.json` per cell, one `<slug>___context.json` per patient, a
`CAPTURE_DONE` marker). `score_probe_safety.py --selftest` runs the shipped scorer over each as a
subprocess and asserts its exit code **and** its reported counts, so a future edit that changes what
any of these arms scores fails loudly instead of quietly making the numbers in
[#107](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/107)'s and
[#110](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/pull/110)'s records irreproducible.
It also refuses to run if any directory here is asserted by no case, which is the only count that
matters and is the reason this paragraph no longer carries one: the header said "Seven" while there
were eight, and #283 propagated that to "Nine" over ten.

Read this file before editing a fixture. Some of the answer texts are deliberately
**counterfactual** and one chip no longer fires on `main`; both facts are load-bearing and are
stated per file below — grep this file for `CONSTRUCTED` and `COUNTERFACTUAL` rather than trusting a
count here, which is the defect the paragraph above records twice. (`finding-no-chip/` was added by #179, `unsupported-caution/` and
`caution-over-major/` by #283, and the six `severity-*` arms by #299 — see their sections, which
say per arm what is constructed and why.)

## Why any of it is counterfactual

A regression fixture for a scoring blind spot has to contain the failure the scorer must catch. The
shipped build does not emit these failures — that is *why* they went unnoticed for four revisions —
so they cannot be captured live at all: the arms that produced them were reverted.
`caution-over-major/` rests on a weaker claim than that, stated in its own section: not that the
build cannot emit the shape, only that no capture here does. Everything not marked **CONSTRUCTED** or
**COUNTERFACTUAL** below is a verbatim live capture — the markers are the record, and #299 adding
several more of them is what turned the counts that used to stand here stale.

`caution-lead/` is the exception that proves it: #283's third verdict lead is a shape the shipped
build DOES produce, so that arm is a live capture and needed no construction at all.
`severity-overstated/` is a second such exception, and it differs from `caution-lead/` in what the
live capture IS: `caution-lead/` captures correct module behaviour that the scorer misread, while
this one captures a module DEFECT — #299's own cell, reproduced on demand three times with the same
answer and the same chips — so the failure it pins needed no reconstruction. Its twin `severity-concordant/` is constructed,
from it, by one word.

## The live captures these are built from

All from `probe.sh` against the 3.7.1 standalone (`~/Downloads/referenceapplication-standalone-3.7.1`,
port 8081, `sourceFormat=ddinter`, full 19MB KB, `minInteractionSeverity=minor`, `chartMode=fullChart`,
`llm.engine=local`).

| capture | patient + question | when / build |
|---|---|---|
| `out-ctl1-mary-clarithro.json` | Mary Smith `38beca4a…` — *"Is it safe to give her clarithromycin?"* | 2026-08-05, merged `main` (regression control 1) |
| `out-ctl2-agnes-warfarin.json` | Agnes Adams `47e57b75…` — *"Is it safe to start warfarin?"* | 2026-08-05, merged `main` (regression control 2) |
| `out-ctl3-josh-ibuprofen.json` | Joshua Johnson `9cb37bcb…` — *"Can I give ibuprofen?"* | 2026-08-05, merged `main` (regression control 3) |
| `out-ctl4-mary-paracetamol.json` | Mary Smith — *"Is it safe to give her paracetamol?"* | 2026-08-05, merged `main` (regression control 4) |
| `out-i112-r1-B3.json` | Agnes Adams — *"Is it safe to give her aspirin?"* | 2026-08-04, PR #125 branch, round 1 cell **B3** — one of that PR's 8/8 abstention controls |
| `out-c1-tiotropium-linezolid.json` | Susan Young `763e6e5f…` — *"Is it safe to give linezolid?"* | 2026-08-04, PR #125 branch, cell **C1** |
| `caution-lead/mary__safety-warfarin.json` | Mary Smith — *"Can this patient take warfarin?"* | 2026-08-19, #283 branch — the probe's own phrasing, captured by running its 20 cells |
| `severity-overstated/steven__safety-rifabutin.json` | Steven White `cbc1658d…` — *"Can I give rifabutin?"* | 2026-08-22, merged `main` @ `47b6aa0d` — issue #299's own question, and neither its patient nor its drug nor its phrasing is one of the probe's DEFAULTS, so it was taken by the same `POST /chartsearchai/search` `capture_probe_safety.sh` makes rather than by running the probe. The probe can produce this cell now — see that arm's section |

Patient states (verified live by the sessions that captured the above): Mary — Simvastatin 20mg;
Agnes — Aspirin 81mg; Joshua — Lisinopril 10mg + aspirin allergy; Susan — Tiotropium 18mg;
Steven — Isoniazid / Rifapentine, no allergies (the allergy read answers 204).

The first four rows are the module's four documented regression controls (1 chip Major
×simvastatin; 1 chip Major ×aspirin; 2 chips, NSAID contraindication + lisinopril Moderate; 0
chips). `shipped-clean` therefore asserts them as committed data on every CI run, instead of their
being re-run by hand against the one shared standalone.

## Per directory

### `shipped-clean/` — the control that must exit 0
The five cells verbatim. Nothing here may be flagged; if it is, the guards are crying wolf on the
answers the module actually produces. Pins: ANSWER 4 (three by chip, one by `own_drug`),
verdict-led 3, unlicensed 0, abstained 1, ABSTAIN 1 held 1, and the per-cell list's `ABST` marker on
`agnes__safety-aspirin`, which is the only thing on that row reporting the `abstained` predicate the
count above it is computed from — `classify` calls the cell NO, so the label cannot stand in for it.

* `mary__safety-clarithromycin.json` ← `out-ctl1-mary-clarithro.json`, byte-identical.
* `agnes__safety-warfarin.json` ← `out-ctl2-agnes-warfarin.json`, byte-identical.
* `joshua__safety-ibuprofen.json` ← `out-ctl3-josh-ibuprofen.json`, byte-identical. Two chips for
  one asked drug (a cross-reactivity contraindication and a Moderate interaction), so the per-drug
  chip filter is exercised with more than one match.
* `mary__safety-paracetamol.json` ← `out-ctl4-mary-paracetamol.json`, byte-identical. The 0-chip
  control: correctly floor-filtered, so the cell is ABSTAIN and its abstention must hold.
* `agnes__safety-aspirin.json` ← `out-i112-r1-B3.json`, byte-identical. **The cell the fourth blind
  spot lives on**: her own drug, so the chart addresses the question and the label is ANSWER, while
  the validator deliberately raises nothing (no interaction, no allergy — she is simply on it). Its
  real answer abstains, which this scorer counts as the defect it is.
* `mary___context.json` — Mary's `drugs` list is the verbatim REST `display` of her active order
  (`(NEW) Simvastatin Co 20mg: 20.0 Milligram Oral Once daily`, captured in the #113 session's
  order fetch).
* `agnes___context.json`, `joshua___context.json` — these two order/allergen **names** are from the
  session records (`Aspirin 81mg`; `Lisinopril 10mg` + an aspirin allergy); the exact REST display
  decoration was not captured. Only the drug token is load-bearing: it is what `_aliases()` matches
  to set `own_drug`, and for Joshua's ibuprofen cell `own_drug` is false either way — that cell is
  labelled by its chips.

### `unsupported-no/` — blind spot 4, this issue's direction
`shipped-clean` with **one field changed**: `agnes__safety-aspirin.json`'s `answer`.

> **CONSTRUCTED**: `"No — aspirin should not be given: it interacts with the patient's other
> medications."`

Constructed to the failure #126 describes (*an answer opening "No — X should not be given" with
nothing behind it*) and to row 1 of PR #125's three-row blind-spot table (*own-drug fabricated NO*).
The register is the model's own: its real verdict leads on addressed cells read *"No — Warfarin
should not be started: …"* (see `agnes__safety-warfarin.json`), which is what makes this the
plausible over-generalisation of the lead #112/PR #125 teaches. Nothing in the cell supports it —
no chip, no injected finding, and the interaction it claims is not in the capture.

Before the fix, on the shipped scorer: `verdict-led A=2 B=3`, `abstained A=1 B=0`, no integrity
flag, **exit 0** — a two-column improvement. After: the same two columns (unchanged on purpose) plus
the flag and **exit 3**. Both single-arm and A/B-against-`shipped-clean` are asserted, because the
A/B is how the gate is actually read.

### `inverted-yes/` — blind spot 3, the direction #110 closed
`shipped-clean` with **one field changed**: `mary__safety-clarithromycin.json`'s `answer`, replaced
by prompt-variant **arm C**'s recorded output (2026-07-30, README *"C — the verdict rule's YES
criterion is a presence criterion"*, quoted the same way in `inverted_yes`'s docstring):

> `"Yes, the records address the drug and its interactions: ... ivosidenib (Major...)"`

Verbatim from the record, ellipses included — the recorded quote is elided, and the elision is not
in the part the scorer reads (the lead). Arm C ran before findings were injected pre-answer, so on
that build the cell had a chip and no `safety_finding` record; the chips and references kept here are
the current-shape ones from `out-ctl1`, deliberately, because the fixture's job is to pin what the
CURRENT scorer does with an inverted "Yes" on a CURRENT-shape capture. Caught before this change and
after it: this arm is the regression direction for the rename.

### `wrong-partner/` — the gap this issue does NOT close
`susan__safety-linezolid.json` ← `out-c1-tiotropium-linezolid.json`, chips and references verbatim,
`answer` replaced by PR #125's own rendering of the same finding under a verdict lead:

> **CONSTRUCTED** (verbatim from PR #125's body): `"No — Linezolid should not be given: Linezolid
> interacts with active order opium"`

The chip rests on issue #86's unanchored substring match — *"active order opium"* is really
**tiotropium**. The verdict is wrong on content and licensed on shape, and this scorer passes it,
**exit 0**. Asserted so the boundary is visible rather than assumed: when a chip-versus-answer
concordance check lands, this is the expectation that has to change. #299 landed the SEVERITY half
of that check and this expectation did NOT change — the answer here names no rating at all, so
`discordant_severity` has nothing to compare. It is the PARTNER half that reaches this arm, and it
has not landed.

Note: `main` no longer emits that chip (#128 anchored the match — the same question now answers
*"The records do not address the safety of giving Linezolid."* with zero chips). The fixture
documents a property of the **scorer**, using a capture the module has since stopped producing.

### `alias-own-drug/` — blind spots 1 and 2
* `demo__safety-paracetamol.json` — body reused from `out-ctl4-mary-paracetamol.json` (a generic
  abstention, *"The records do not address paracetamol."*).
* `demo___context.json` — **CONSTRUCTED**: `drugs: ["Acetaminophen 500mg"]`. Slug `demo` stands for
  the cohort patient the README records as holding an Acetaminophen order; that capture is gone, and
  attributing a constructed order to a named real patient would be worse. The synonym is the whole
  point: the KB resolves it, so this patient is already taking "paracetamol".
* `mary__safety-clarithromycin.json` ← `out-ctl1`, verbatim. Present only so the arm has a chip and
  the zero-chip refusal does not fire — otherwise this arm cannot show what it is for.

Pins ANSWER 2 / abstained 1 / ABSTAIN 0. Under blind spot 1 (label on chips alone) **or** blind
spot 2 (substring instead of alias matching), the paracetamol cell becomes ABSTAIN and the same
abstention reads as *"abstention held 1/1"* — the column inversion the README records.

### `stray-file/` — a file that is not a cell
Mary's two real cells plus `.d.json`, which is the temp file `capture_probe_safety.sh` writes for the
order fetch and deletes — left behind whenever a run is killed between the two. Its body is the
verbatim REST order response for Mary from the #113 session (`i113-orders-mary.json`), so this is
what the leftover actually contains.

Its filename has no `__safety-<drug>` segment, so the alias needle is empty and `"" in x` matched
every chip and every order: it used to score `ANSWER +own` and pad the denominator (ANSWER 2,
stated-no-lead 1). Now ANSWER 1 with an `unreadable capture` flag. Pinned at **exit 3** — it already
exited 3 before, but through the unrelated patient-context check, which a stray whose slug happened
to match a patient would not have tripped.

### `finding-no-chip/` — #133's own broadening, which nothing exercised
Added by #179. `adverse_finding` takes the union of chips and injected `safety_finding` records;
#133 introduced the finding half and said so plainly ("a real broadening... no recorded capture is
known to differ"). It was right, and that was the problem: a mutation sweep reverting the union to
`bool(cell["chips"])` alone left **all eight** other arms green, so the only decision that PR made
beyond a rename had no test at all.

* `mary___context.json` ← `shipped-clean/`, verbatim. Simvastatin genuinely is her own active
  order, which is what makes the simvastatin cell an ANSWER cell with no chip needed.
* `mary__safety-clarithromycin.json` ← `shipped-clean/`, verbatim. Present only so the arm has a
  chip and the zero-chip refusal does not fire — same role it plays in `alias-own-drug/`.
* `mary__safety-simvastatin.json` — **COUNTERFACTUAL**, and necessarily so. It carries a
  `safety_finding` (`interaction:Simvastatin`) with an **empty** `safetyWarnings`, plus a `Yes`
  lead. The shipped build cannot produce that pair: the finding is injected
  pre-answer and the chip computed post-answer, by the same computation read at two points in one
  request (`score_probe_safety.py`'s own wording), so for the drug asked about a finding arrives with
  its chip. Not "the same `DrugSafetyValidator.validate` call", which this said and which is false —
  there are two calls, and that they name a substance alike is what
  [#238](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/238) had to establish rather
  than something the build gave for free. What makes this fixture counterfactual is the pairing of a
  finding with an EMPTY `safetyWarnings`, which neither pass can produce; the naming half is a
  separate property and is now held by ADR Decision 53. The reference block's shape is copied from
  the real `inverted-yes/mary__safety-clarithromycin.json`; only the reference set and the answer
  differ.

Pins ANSWER 2 / inverted-yes 1 / **exit 3**. With the union reverted to chips alone, `chips` for
simvastatin is empty, `inverted_yes` does not fire, nothing is flagged and the arm exits **0** —
which is what the sweep measured before this fixture existed.

### `caution-lead/` — #283's third verdict lead, captured live
A **live capture**, not counterfactual, and the only arm here whose answer the shipped build
produces today.

* `mary__safety-warfarin.json` — Mary Smith `38beca4a…`, *"Can this patient take warfarin?"*,
  captured 2026-08-19 against the 3.7.1 standalone on the #283 branch (bundled 19MB KB, 2283
  entries, `minInteractionSeverity=minor`, `chartMode=fullChart`, `llm.engine=local`), verbatim.
  Her simvastatin order interacts with warfarin at **Minor**, so the finding states it is a caution
  rather than a reason to withhold, and the answer opens *"Warfarin can be given, with one caution:
  … a Minor finding [77]."*
* `mary___context.json` ← `shipped-clean/`, verbatim — the same patient and the same active order.

Found by running the probe's own 20 cells against that build: this is the one cell of the twenty
that produces the lead, and read the pre-#283 way it scored **verdict-led 0, stated-no-lead 1** —
the #107 hedge — so the arm carrying the fix lost a column to the arm without it. Pins ANSWER 1,
verdict-led 1, hedge 0, unlicensed 0, **exit 0**, and the per-cell list's `CAUT` marker on that cell,
which is the only thing on the row reporting `caution_led` — the share of `verdict-led` this cell is.
`classify` says `NONE` here and `NONE` for a hedge too, so the label cannot attribute the count.

### `severity-overstated/` — issue #299's own cell, captured live
A **live capture**, verbatim and unedited, of the cell the issue was filed for. The shipped build
produces #299's defect on demand, so unlike the arms marked **CONSTRUCTED** elsewhere in this file
this one needed no reconstruction of the failure it pins.

* `steven__safety-rifabutin.json` — Steven White `cbc1658d…`, *"Can I give rifabutin?"*, captured
  2026-08-22 against the 3.7.1 standalone on merged `main` @ `47b6aa0d` (bundled 19MB KB, 2283
  entries, `sourceFormat=ddinter`, `minInteractionSeverity=minor`, `chartMode=fullChart`,
  `llm.engine=local`), verbatim, `/search` response body unedited. His active order is
  `Isoniazid / Rifapentine`; the chips are a **Moderate** rifapentine interaction (folded with a
  J04AB duplicate-therapy sentence) and a **Minor** isoniazid one, and the answer says
  *"… a **Major** problem [293]"*. Reproduced twice more against the same build, identical on every
  field except `questionId`, which is a fresh audit-log row id per request and so can never repeat.
* `steven___context.json` — built from the live REST reads the capture script itself makes
  (`/order?patient=…&t=drugorder` for the drug list, `/patient/…/allergy` for the allergens, which
  answered 204 — he has none). Not `ok: false`: both reads succeeded, so the cell is labelled the
  way the script would have labelled it.

Why the answer's own mechanism text reads `CYP402C8, 2C9, and/or 2C3A4` rather than
`CYP450 2C8, 2C9, and/or 3A4`: that is the SECOND defect #299 reports, deliberately out of its own
scope and out of this arm's — the arm is scored on the rating word alone. It is left in because the
capture is verbatim and editing it would make this a constructed arm.

Pins ANSWER 1, verdict-led 1, unlicensed 0 (the "No" is correct — #299 is explicit that this is not
a #283 violation), **`named a severity no chip carries` 1**, the census `1 of 1`, and **exit 3**.
Before `discordant_severity` it scored exit 0 with every column clean.

**Reproducing the arm needs no hand-made request any more.** `capture_probe_safety.sh` takes
`PROBE_PATIENTS` / `PROBE_DRUGS` beside `CAPTURE_PHRASING`, so

```
PROBE_PATIENTS=steven:cbc1658d-d77e-42e6-bfa8-35ed42882dfc PROBE_DRUGS=rifabutin \
  CAPTURE_PHRASING='Can I give {drug}?' ./capture_probe_safety.sh out-299-A
```

writes this arm's shape against a live standalone. That matters for what this directory can and
cannot be used for: frozen bytes pin the SCORER and cannot move when the MODULE moves, so a check
that a remedy for #299 actually removes the defect has to be run over a fresh capture of that
command. Scoring this directory before and after such a remedy proves only that the scorer was left
alone.

### `severity-concordant/` — the same cell with the one word right
`severity-overstated/` with **one field changed**, and the arm a remedy for #299 would produce.

> **CONSTRUCTED**: `steven__safety-rifabutin.json`'s `answer`, `a Major problem [293]` →
> `a Moderate problem [293]`. Made by replacing those bytes in `severity-overstated/`'s file rather
> than by re-serialising it, so the two differ by exactly that token and by nothing else —
> `safetyWarnings` included, and byte length included (+3).

Its own case pins the class in the silent direction (`named a severity no chip carries` 0, census
`1 of 1`, exit 0). Its real work is the A/B against `severity-overstated/`, which is why the two
exist as a pair rather than as one arm: measured against `main`, with the class absent entirely,
these two arms — one carrying #299's defect, one carrying its fix — printed **no FLIP line and A=B
on every aggregate column, exit 0 on both**. That is the same fail-open `caution_led` was added to
the flip condition for, and it is the COLUMN and the exit code that close it. The flip clause closes
the smaller gap after it: with the class present but not in the flip condition the A/B says an arm
moved (`A=0 B=1`, exit 3) without saying which cell or how. The case also pins the flip row's
`severity:` line, because `classify` renders both sides `NO` and neither carries a lead class, so
without it the row would read `A:NO -> B:NO` with nothing on it saying what moved.

### `severity-unrated-chip/` — the gate that keeps #299's class off its neighbours' ground
`shipped-clean/joshua__safety-ibuprofen.json` with **three fields changed**, and the arm that pins
`discordant_severity`'s silence gate: an ANSWER cell whose chips carry no rating at all and whose
answer names one.

> **CONSTRUCTED**: its `safetyWarnings` are that cell's own two chips with the **interaction** one
> removed, leaving only the cross-reactivity contraindication — which rates nothing, as every
> contraindication does.
>
> **CONSTRUCTED**: the `answer`, `"No — Ibuprofen should not be given: Ibuprofen is in the same
> cross-reactivity group as the patient's allergy to Acetylsalicylic acid [41], a Major problem
> [41]."` — the same closing frame #299's own cell reproduces, over a chip that rates nothing.

Its inherited `references` predate issue #201, which made a reference-group citation serialize
`grounded: null` unconditionally: index 41 still carries the verifier's own verdict, `false`. Arms
captured before that change carry a MIX of `true`, `false` and `null` on such citations — index 42
of this very cell was `true` before it was dropped — and that mix is exactly what #201 removed. The
`steven` cells captured for #299 carry `null`, so the fixtures hold both wire shapes. The scorer never reads `grounded`, so
nothing scores differently — recorded because this file is the record of what each byte is. Grep
`\"grounded\": false` and read which citations are `\"group\": \"reference\"` rather than trusting a
count here; the two counts that first stood in this paragraph were both wrong on the day they were
written, which is the defect this file's own header records twice.

`joshua___context.json` ← `shipped-clean/`, verbatim.

Why the expected result is **silence**, not a flag: the rating cannot have come from a chip of this
drug, so every place left is about something else — a cited `drug_reference` record or
`safety_finding` about another partner, or another drug's own chip in the same response — and those
are the residual false alarms the gate exists to hold out. This arm exists because no live capture
shows the shape — over the 20 cells captured for #299 the gate changes nothing, no ANSWER cell
there naming a
rating over unrated chips — so the silence had nothing pinning it. Pins `named a severity no chip
carries` 0, the census **0 of 1** (the direction the two `1 of 1` assertions cannot reach), and
**exit 0**. Delete the `has_readable_chip_rating(cell) and` from `discordant_severity` and read the
failures — this arm is one of them, and a tally here went stale the first time another arm exercised
the same gate.

### `severity-wrong-chip/` — the boundary in the under-stating direction
`severity-overstated/` with **one field changed**, and the counterpart of `wrong-partner/` for the
severity half: a limit stated rather than closed.

> **CONSTRUCTED**: `steven__safety-rifabutin.json`'s `answer`, `a Major problem [293]` →
> `a Minor problem [293]`, by the same byte replacement `severity-concordant/` uses.

`Minor` IS one of this cell's chip ratings — the isoniazid rule's — while the mechanism the answer
quotes verbatim is the rifapentine rule's, rated **Moderate**. `discordant_severity` subtracts over
the SET of the drug's chip ratings, so the answer names the wrong one of two and passes. That is a
Moderate interaction under-stated, which is not the direction #299 reports but is the same defect;
attributing a rating to the chip whose sentence it sits in needs clause scoping, which this harness
does not do. Pins `named a severity no chip carries` 0, census `1 of 1`, **exit 0** — so the limit is
visible rather than assumed, and when a per-chip attribution lands this is the expectation that has
to change.

### `severity-class-only/` — the healthy arm the collapse flag must not fire on
`severity-concordant/` with its chips and answer replaced, and the only thing pinning WHICH
exclusion the collapse flag uses.

> **CONSTRUCTED**: `safetyWarnings`, replaced by one class-only duplicate-therapy join —
> `"Rifabutin is in the same ATC class (J04AB) as active order Isoniazid / Rifapentine — possible
> duplicate therapy"`, `type: "interaction"`.
>
> **CONSTRUCTED**: the `answer`, rewritten to name no rating, as an answer over an unrated join
> would not.

That chip is `TYPE_INTERACTION` and carries no rating BY DESIGN (`DrugSafetyValidator`: "No rating,
and not an omission"), so a collapse flag keyed on the chip TYPE calls this healthy arm reworded —
and on `sourceFormat=atc`, where the source publishes classifications and no rules, EVERY
interaction chip is this kind, so such a flag would fire on every arm that source can produce. Pins
**exit 0** with nothing flagged; key the flag on the type instead of on `rule_chip_details` and this
is what reddens.

### `severity-chip-reworded/` — the arm that proves the census had to be a gate
`severity-overstated/` with the CHIP side reworded and the answer untouched, PLUS
`shipped-clean/`'s mary cell untouched beside it.

> **CONSTRUCTED**: both of steven's chip `detail` strings, `— Moderate.` → `(Moderate severity):`
> and `— Minor.` → `(Minor severity):`. His `answer` still says *"a Major problem [293]"*.

* `mary__safety-clarithromycin.json` and `mary___context.json` ← `shipped-clean/`, verbatim. They are
  what make this a PARTIAL reword: her chip still yields `Major`, so an arm-level flag would see one
  readable cell and stay silent while steven's cell carries a real overstatement. That is why the
  flag is per cell.

`CHIP_SEVERITY` parses a clause the module renders, and every fixture here is a frozen capture — so a
reword in `DrugSafetyValidator.interactionWarning` or `DdiDrugReferenceSource.noteFor` cannot redden
any of them, while every LIVE arm would report a clean zero for the wrong reason. Measured on steven's cell alone, before `summarise` gained the collapse check and before mary's
cell was added beside it: `named a severity no chip carries` 0, census `0 of 1`, **exit 0** — the
arm that exists to fail #299 scoring a pass. That is #207's own fault
("left … green while it asserted nothing at all"). Now pins **exit 3** with the census at `1 of 2`
and the column still at 0, so a reader cannot mistake "could not run" for "passed". Delete the
`unratable` computation in `summarise`, or make its flag arm-level again
(`if unratable and not readable:`), and read the failures.

### `unsupported-caution/` — the fail-open direction that opens
`shipped-clean` with **one field changed**: `agnes__safety-aspirin.json`'s `answer`, the same cell
`unsupported-no/` uses and for the same reason — her own drug, so the label is ANSWER while the
validator deliberately raises nothing.

> **CONSTRUCTED**: `"Aspirin can be given, with one caution: it interacts with the patient's other
> medications."`

The caution-lead twin of `unsupported-no/`'s fabricated NO, deliberately claiming the same
non-existent interaction so the two arms differ only in the lead. Counting a caution as verdict-led
without a licence check turns an uncounted cell into a two-column win, which is the shape #126
records in the negative direction. The shipped build does not fabricate a caution over an empty
deterministic layer — which is exactly why nothing would have caught it. Pins verdict-led 4,
unlicensed 1 (caution direction 1, the other two 0), **exit 3**, and the A/B against
`shipped-clean` at exit 3 as well, because the A/B is how the gate is actually read. That A/B is also
where both FLIP suffixes are pinned (`A:NO abstain -> B:NONE caution`), this being the one line in
the selftest that carries either.

### `caution-over-major/` — the boundary the licence check cannot reach
`shipped-clean` with **one field changed**: `mary__safety-clarithromycin.json`'s `answer`, the cell
whose chip is a **Major** simvastatin interaction.

> **CONSTRUCTED**: `"Clarithromycin can be given, with one caution: it interacts with active order
> Simvastatin [76], a Major problem [77]."`

Written in the lead the prompt teaches, over a finding whose rating does not license it — a refusal
degrading into a permission, which is the direction #283 carries its risk in. The shipped build was
not observed producing it, and this arm is not asserting that it cannot; what it pins is what the
harness can and cannot SEE, which is the same job `wrong-partner/` does one shape over.

Nothing here is flagged, and that is the assertion: `adverse_finding` is satisfied (there is a chip),
so `unsupported_caution` cannot fire, and asking whether the *rating* licenses a caution would put a
second copy of `DrugSafetyValidator.licensesWithholding` in Python. Pins ANSWER 4, verdict-led 3,
unlicensed 0, **exit 0** — the boundary — and, against `shipped-clean`, the A/B line that makes the
degradation legible without any of that: `FLIP … A:NO -> B:NONE caution` with
`verdict-led A=3 B=3` beside it. Before the flip condition compared `caution_led`, that A/B printed
no flip and A=B on every column.

### `zero-chip/` — the arm that cannot show the defect
`mary__safety-clarithromycin.json` with `safetyWarnings` and `references` **emptied**, which is
exactly what a capture taken with the drug-reference GPs off looks like, plus the real paracetamol
cell. Every label collapses to ABSTAIN and the report reads like a pass; this used to exit 0. Pins
the refusal at **exit 3**.

## The #397 arms — five arms of one patient, and three of them are live

All five directories below are two cells of ONE patient on the 3.7.1 standalone, captured
2026-09-09 against the deployed omod at the head that carries #395: patient
`dc8560c9-6d2b-45bf-861c-8fcf562ec9b1` on eight active drug orders, `sourceFormat=ddinter`,
`chartMode=fullChart`, `PROBE_DRUGS='Amlodipine Nifedipine'`,
`CAPTURE_PHRASING='should i give {drug}?'`. **The Nifedipine cell is byte-identical in the first
three** — seven findings, seven cited, no rating dropped — so across those it is the control and
every difference is the Amlodipine cell's. In the two CONSTRUCTED arms it is NOT: a key was deleted
from both cells there, which is the whole of each of those arms, so a difference in one of them is
not attributable to the Amlodipine cell alone.

Three of the five are verbatim live captures, which is unusual here and is the point: this defect is
one the shipped build emits on the majority of its own cells, so it needed no construction. The
14-drug corpus these two cells were cut from, and what each arm of it measured, is
`eval/drift-metric/README.md`'s section on the finding-enumeration corpus — the one home of that
ledger. What is recorded here is only what is true of THESE two cells.

### `findings-incomplete/` — the defect, live
The Amlodipine cell exactly as `POST /chartsearchai/search` returned it: `findingCitations`
`{"carried": 7, "cited": 6}`, the answer naming six of her active orders and closing on *"Finally,
it interacts with active order Hydrocortisone, a Moderate problem [354]"*. The seventh finding —
Amlodipine against her `Advil 400mg`, Moderate — appears in no sentence.

**Before this change the scorer reported this arm as CLEAN, exit 0**: every column it prints is
identical to `findings-complete/`'s, because none of them reads whether the prose stated every
finding it was given. That is the whole reason the cell exists. Pins **exit 3** and the per-cell
`6/7`.

### `findings-complete/` — the same cell, complete, live
The same question with the format clause's own wording appended to it as a probe:
`{"carried": 7, "cited": 7}`,
`unstatedFindingSeverities` `[]`, and the lead still *"No — Amlodipine should not be given"*. The
boundary arm — nothing here may be flagged, or the guard is crying wolf on the answer it exists to
pass. Pins **exit 0**.

**None of these captures is newline-delimited, and that is worth stating because the clause asks for
lines.** All six live answers here contain zero `\n`: what the clause changed is the SENTENCE
structure — seven `Amlodipine interacts with active order X [n], Moderate.` sentences where the
baseline ran six together with discourse connectives — not the line structure. The arm that did
produce newlined answers is the system-prompt one, which ADR Decision 84 records as making
completeness worse. So do not read `findings-complete/` as an example of a line-delimited answer, and
do not treat a future genuinely line-delimited arm as the same shape as this one.

### `findings-complete-unrated/` — the trade, live, and the reason there are two keys
The same cell asked for a bare numbered list. `{"carried": 7, "cited": 7}` — so the completeness
column reads exactly as clean as `findings-complete/`'s — and `unstatedFindingSeverities` naming
**all seven** citations: every finding stated, every rating gone. A completeness cell read ALONE
scores this a win, which is what issue #397 means by trading one safety property for another, and
`score_probe_safety.py` refuses it instead. Pins **exit 3** with
`cells that stated fewer (the defect): 0` beside the refusal.

### `findings-unmeasured/` — **CONSTRUCTED**, by deleting one key
`findings-incomplete/`'s two cells with `findingCitations` **removed** and everything else — the
answers, the chips, the references, `unstatedFindingSeverities`, the key order — untouched. That is
not a hypothetical shape: it is what a capture taken between #384 and #395 looks like, and what all
17 directories above this block are.

Two arms, because absence has two different answers. Alone it is a CENSUS and not a failure — every
fixture above predates the key, so a `problems` entry here would redden `shipped-clean/` for a
reason unrelated to what it pins — and it pins **exit 0** with
`cells stating no extent at all (not counted above): 2 of 2`. Against `findings-complete/` it is
**refused at exit 3**, because there the column is being read to decide whether a change worked and
it ran on one side only; without that refusal a pre-#395 arm A against a post-#395 arm B reports
`A=0 B=0`, a clean tie over nothing.

### `findings-ratings-unmeasured/` — **CONSTRUCTED**, by deleting the OTHER key
`findings-complete/`'s two cells with `unstatedFindingSeverities` **removed** and everything else —
the answers, the chips, the references, `findingCitations`, the key order — untouched. Its sibling
above drops the extent key; this one keeps it and drops the rating key — a pair no real capture
has, #384 having added the rating key two days before #395 added the extent one, so the
captured window is the sibling's shape and this one had to be constructed.

Two arms again, because absence has the same two answers one key over. Alone it is a CENSUS at
**exit 0**, with `cells whose answer dropped a cited finding's rating: 0 of 0 that measured it`
beside `cells stating no extent at all (not counted above): 0 of 2` — the extent column ran, the
rating column did not. Against `findings-complete/` it is **refused at exit 3**, and that refusal
had no fixture behind it before this arm: every directory carrying the extent key carried the rating
key too, and the ones carrying neither agree at *no measurement*, so no pair disagreed and the
refusal could not fire. Without it the pair prints
`cells that dropped a cited finding's rating: A=0 B=0 of 0 that measured it` and exits 0 — a clean
tie in the one column that tells a completeness win from a completeness-for-ratings trade.

**Paired with `findings-complete/` and not with `findings-complete-unrated/`, and that is
load-bearing.** The unrated arm reports problems of its own, so a pair built on it exits 3 whether
or not the refusal is there — measured — and the case would pin nothing.
