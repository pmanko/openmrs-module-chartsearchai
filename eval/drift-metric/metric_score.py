"""Honest-metric scorer. UUID set comparison vs human gold (no model-derived drift terms).

Usage:
  metric_score.py <capture_dir> [offtopic_adj.json] [metric_gold.json]
  metric_score.py --selftest

  capture_dir: per-cell response JSON {answer, references:[{resourceUuid,index,resourceType,
      attachedByTheModule}]}. A reference the MODULE attached rather than the model citing it is
      not scored — see the filter in main(); an older capture carrying no such key scores as before.
  offtopic_adj.json (default: alongside this script): out-of-focus cited records adjudicated.
      {"<patientUuid|topic>": ["uuid",...]}  -> OFF-topic
      {"_ontopic": {"<cell>": ["uuid",...]}} -> ON-topic
  metric_gold.json (default: alongside this script): per cell {present, ontopic{uuid:text}, focus_uuids{uuid:text}}.

Each cited record is classified ON-topic (gold.ontopic + adjudicated _ontopic) / OFF-topic
(in the top-30 focus but not on-topic, OR adjudicated off) / UNKNOWN (out-of-focus, not yet
adjudicated). Present cells -> precision/recall/F1; absent cells -> abstention correctness.
Recall denominator = the full on-topic universe (focus-30 on-topic + adjudicated out-of-focus
on-topic), so recall is bounded by 1.0 and matches the README's expanding-gold definition.
A record listed in BOTH off_adj and on_adj counts ON (on_adj wins)."""

    ONE home for this rule, and the reason is the direction its failure takes. Since issue #305 the
    module publishes the chart record an injected safety_finding was derived from whenever the model
    cites that finding, marked `attachedByTheModule` — a record the answer never reached for, which
    no gate over the model's citation behaviour may score. Every reader of it defaults the key to
    falsy so a pre-#305 capture scores exactly as it always did; that default also means a RENAME of
    the wire key disables the filter in the fail-OPEN direction, re-admitting every attached
    citation. `selftest` spells the key as a literal for that reason and CI runs it, so a rename
    reddens `--selftest` instead of moving a gate number. Four copies of that default meant four
    places a rename had to reach and a grep for the key had four hits; one means the key is spelled
    once.

    Callers: this module's own scorer, resolve_unknowns.py and temporal_probe_rc2.py.
    eval/grounding-scope/grounding_scope_ab.py deliberately does NOT share it — it TAGS such a
    citation rather than excluding it, so that its own True/False and `is None` tally classes cannot
    match it, and a shared exclusion predicate would obscure that.
