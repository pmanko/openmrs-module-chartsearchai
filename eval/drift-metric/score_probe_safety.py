"""Scores a safety/suitability probe capture (capture_probe_safety.sh).

Each cell is "Can <patient> take <drug>?". The expected shape is labelled from data:

  ANSWER   the drug connects to this patient — a chip naming THAT drug fired, or the drug is
           one of their own active orders / recorded allergies. The answer must lead with a
           verdict. An abstention here is the #107 guard over-firing.
  ABSTAIN  neither holds. The answer must abstain, and must not lead with a bare Yes/No —
           #107 exists to stop that, so this is the regression direction.

Six things this scorer refuses to do quietly, each because an earlier revision did and it
corrupted a result — or, for the last two, would have passed one:

  * Label on chips alone. A patient ALREADY TAKING the drug raises no chip — the validator
    explicitly skips restating existing therapy — while their chart addresses the question
    through the active order. Labelling that ABSTAIN credited an answer saying "the records do
    not address whether she can take aspirin" about a patient holding an active aspirin order,
    and inverted the deciding column of the first A/B.
  * Match drug names by substring. The KB resolves aliases, so a patient on "Acetaminophen"
    is already taking "paracetamol"; a substring test missed that on the control drug.
  * Label from one arm. `safetyWarnings` depends on the ANSWER as well as the patient — the
    validator also raises warnings for drugs the answer names — so the arms can disagree about
    a cell's label. Comparing across a disagreement is meaningless, so it hard-fails.
  * Accept an arm that cannot show the defect. With the drug-reference GPs off, or the
    validator throwing, every chip vanishes and the probe prints a clean pass with the defect
    invisible. Zero chips across an arm is an error, not a result.
  * Credit a verdict the records do not license, in ANY direction — a "Yes" contradicting this
    drug's own chip or finding, and a negative or caution lead where that layer raised nothing at
    all. All score as +1 verdict-led / -1 abstained, i.e. as an improvement, which is why they are
    flagged rather than left to the columns. See `unlicensed_verdict`; #126 records the second
    half and #283 the third.
  * Count a file that is not a cell. Without the drug name a filename carries, the alias needle is
    empty, and an empty needle matches every chip and every order.

Verdict classification defers to score_directness.classify — the versioned metric definition —
and YES, NO and the #283 CAUTION lead count as verdict-led. CANNOT ("cannot be determined from
the records") is a hedge, not a verdict, and must not score as the goal state.

The caution lead is this file's own class (`caution_led`), not classify's: since #283 a finding
that states it is a caution rather than a reason to withhold licenses an answer opening "the drug
can be given, with one caution", which classify calls NONE. Counting that as a hedge made the arm
carrying the fix lose a verdict-led cell to the arm without it — measured over this probe's own 20
cells, `mary__safety-warfarin`. Numbers quoted against the verdict-led column before 2026-08-19 are
not comparable on a capture containing a caution lead; `verdict_led` carries the amendment. Two
things keep a hedge out of the class without enumerating hedge wordings, and CAUTION_LEAD_TAIL is
where both are argued: the lead is anchored on the cell's OWN drug, and between that and the modal
only name material may stand.

What it checks of the verdict's CONTENT is one thing, and #299 is where that started: whether the
answer NAMES the severity the deterministic layer assigned — `discordant_severity`. It is the first
piece of the chip-versus-answer concordance check this module long deferred, and deliberately the
smallest: it compares two words and makes no judgement about either.

What it still does NOT check is the rest of that content. That the partner named is one the patient
actually has: a "No" resting on issue #86's unanchored substring match — "active order opium" for a
patient on tiotropium — is a licensed verdict by shape and indistinguishable from a correct one
here. And whether the finding's rating LICENSES the call made over it (the one #283 adds), so a
caution lead over a Major interaction still passes. Both are boundaries rather than oversights:
`fixtures/probe-safety/wrong-partner` and `caution-over-major` pin them, one shape each, so what is
unchecked is visible rather than assumed. The second is deliberately unreachable from here — asking
whether a rating licenses a caution would put a second copy of
`DrugSafetyValidator.licensesWithholding` in Python, which is the drift `adverse_finding` refuses.
Naming the rating needs no such judgement, which is why THAT half could land and these two cannot.

What IS checked in every direction is that the deterministic layer raised something at all — see
`unlicensed_verdict`. What the A/B adds, short of the content, is that it compares the CLASS of the
lead and not only the columns the class feeds: `verdict_led` is a union since #283, so two arms can
tie on it while one leads with a refusal and the other with a permission. See the flip condition in `main`.

Exit codes, because a gate that only ever exits 0 is not a gate:

  0  clean read — the numbers can be used
  2  incomparable: the arms disagree about a cell's expected shape, so no margin is meaningful
  3  anything `summarise` put in `problems` — read the `!!` lines, do not infer the cause from a
     list here. They are of two kinds and exit 3 does NOT say which: the capture is unusable (a
     partial arm, an unreadable capture, a failed patient context, an arm with no chips at all,
     a rule interaction chip whose rating will not parse), or the capture is fine and the MODEL
     did something the records do not license (`inverted_yes`, `unsupported_no`,
     `unsupported_caution`, or an answer naming a severity no chip carries). An enumeration was
     kept here and was incomplete on the day #299 extended it, which is why this now names the
     two kinds and points at the output. The numbers ARE still printed, for a human to read —
     but a zero-chip arm reports "abstained 0" and "abstention held 17/17" purely because every
     cell collapsed to ABSTAIN, which is indistinguishable from a pass to anything reading the
     exit code alone.

# The third verdict lead, taught by the system prompt since #283: a finding that states it is a
# caution rather than a reason to withhold licenses an answer that opens by saying the drug CAN be
# given and names the caution in the same sentence. It is deliberately not a "Yes" — #107 arm C
# measured a presence-shaped "Yes" inverting the call 5/6 on this exact question shape — so
# score_directness.classify returns NONE for it, which is that scorer's name for a hedge.
#
# Lives here rather than in classify for two reasons. classify is the locked metric definition for
# the yes/no directness gate, whose captures are presence topics (allergies, eye, heart …) where a
# safety finding cannot arise, so widening it would move numbers on a gate this has nothing to do
# with. And the shape is safety-specific: outside a safety question "X can be given" is not a
# verdict about anything.
#
# THREE things are required, and the first is what makes the other two hold. The prompt teaches the
# whole shape — "open by stating that the drug can be given, and name the caution in the same
# sentence so it is never dropped" — so a lead must (1) OPEN ON THE DRUG the cell is about, (2) reach
# "can be given" with no subordinating marker in between, and (3) name a caution before the sentence
# ends. Each was added after the one before it was measured insufficient, and the order is kept here
# because it is the only thing stopping the weakest version being reinstated as a simplification.
#
# (3) came first. Matching "can be given" alone credited hedges that fit a 40-character window and
# that neither classify nor ABSTAINED catches — "It is unclear whether warfarin can be given", "I
# cannot determine whether warfarin can be given" and two more, all pinned below. Neither does
# `unsupported_caution`, which fires only where the deterministic layer raised nothing, so on a cell
# that DOES carry a finding the hedge scored as the win: the #107 hedge credited by the instrument
# built to count it. `cautions?` is plural because a mixed set of findings can carry more than one.
#
# (2) came second: a hedge can name a caution itself ("It is unclear whether warfarin can be given,
# so caution is advised"), so the span BEFORE the verb phrase is constrained as well as the one after
# it. That started as a list of subordinating markers and ended up as the structural rule below, for
# the reason (1) did.
#
# (1) is this round, and it replaces a blacklist that could not be finished — with TWO rules, whose
# division of labour is measured below rather than asserted. The marker list was "the shapes seen", and
# review measured ELEVEN more registers it does not see, every one of which scored verdict-led: "It is
# possible that warfarin can be given, with caution" and the same frame under
# may/uncertain/doubtful/questionable/could-be-argued/nothing-states/insufficient-data/unsure, plus
# "It seems warfarin can be given, with caution" and "Presumably warfarin can be given, with
# caution". Widening the list was the wrong answer and this comment already said why: a list growing
# per counterexample is how a regex ends up matching nothing anybody wrote — and the last two
# subordinate nothing at all, so no marker reaches them however long the list gets.
#
# What closes it is the half of the prompt's own shape the regex was not using: every lead it teaches
# opens ON THE DRUG ("Gentamicin can be given, with one caution: …"), and nothing else may stand
# between that and the modal. The scorer already knows which drug each cell is about, since the
# filename carries it and _aliases resolves it, which is how `chips`, `own_drug` and `findings` are
# filtered. All eleven registers are rejected.
#
# The marker list is GONE, and that is the second half of the same fix rather than a tidy-up. The
# anchor leaves one span open — between the drug name and the modal, where "Warfarin, if it can be
# given, warrants caution" would otherwise read as a lead — and every attempt to guard that span by
# naming hedges failed the same way the outer one did. Each attempt was measured, and each measurement
# falsified the claim written beside the one before it:
#
#   nine markers        -> pinned by eight hedge cases while it stood alone, but with the anchor in
#                          front of it dropping the whole lookahead reddened exactly ONE case, so
#                          eight of the nine had become a guard that could not fire (CLAUDE.md's rule
#                          about those). It did catch "Warfarin, unable to say, can be given".
#   three complementizers
#   (`if`/`that`/`whether`)
#                       -> claimed to catch everything the nine did. FALSE: the `unable` aside above
#                          passes all three.
#   ... plus a comma ban -> claimed only a subordinating clause and a comma-delimited aside can fit.
#                          FALSE again: "Warfarin possibly can be given, with caution" carries neither,
#                          and nor does "Warfarin (uncertain) can be given, with caution".
#
# So the span is stated POSITIVELY instead, by what a real lead needs it for rather than by what a
# hedge might put there: between the anchored name and the modal, only NAME MATERIAL may stand —
# whitespace, a hyphen or dash, and one bracketed group ("Rifampicin (rifampin) can be given"). One rule in
# place of four, and it subsumes all of them: a subordinating clause, a comma-delimited aside, a
# pre-modal adverb and a dose apposition all put a bare word, a comma or a digit there, and none of
# those is name material. A multi-word display name is handled in DRUG_ALIASES rather than by letting
# the span carry words, which is what keeps that true.
#
# What it does NOT close is exactly one thing, and it is the one thing in the span that is not read:
# the CONTENTS of the bracketed group. "Warfarin (uncertain) can be given, with caution" is shaped
# identically to "Warfarin (Minor) can be given, with caution", and closing it means enumerating what
# may appear inside brackets, which is the blacklist this rule exists to remove. Stating it that way
# rather than by example is another correction to this comment: the span first allowed a few name
# words before the bracket, to reach past "Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin)", so the residue was really
# "up to three unread words plus an unread bracket" — "Acetylsalicylic uncertain (x) can be given"
# counted. Putting the full display name in DRUG_ALIASES removed the need for those words, so the span
# now carries none and the residue is the bracket alone.
#
# The captures are the reason to think even that is narrow, and they were counted rather than assumed:
# across every answer in fixtures/probe-safety there is exactly ONE parenthetical, `ivosidenib
# (Major...)` in inverted-yes, i.e. a SEVERITY. So a bracket after a drug name carries a synonym or a
# severity in practice, both of which are real leads and both pinned below.
#
# The natural adverb position bounds the residue on its own: "Warfarin can possibly be given" breaks
# `can be given`, which the tail requires contiguous, so only the stilted pre-modal placement ever
# reached the span, and that is now refused too. A shape that gets past all of this is a new case
# below, not a looser span.
#
# WHICH of the two rejects the hedges was measured, and it is not the one this comment first credited.
# Drop the anchor and only POSITIVES redden: every real lead stops counting, because the span will not
# absorb "Ibuprofen " either. Loosen the span to a bare 30-character window and only HEDGES redden. So
# the two cover the hedges redundantly, and what each uniquely holds is the other half — the anchor
# ADMITS the drug name, the span REFUSES everything that is not name material. The evidence does not
# single out either as "the" fix, and the earlier drafts of this comment that did were wrong in both
# directions.
#
# WHICH CASE holds which part is left to the cases. A per-mutation tally lived here, in ADR 37 and in
# the CLAUDE.md bullet, and went stale every time the rule moved, because the numbers move with it —
# the same defect PROVENANCE's directory count had, with the same remedy: every part has at least one
# case below, the selftest names the case that breaks, and CI runs it on every push.
# The span replaced a {0,40} character window, which is what a drug name plus a parenthetical cost when
# the span still had to hold the name itself.
#
# The trade-offs are real and are the ones already taken twice here. A lead that does not open on the
# drug stops counting ("The patient can be given ibuprofen, with one caution"), so does "Warfarin can
# be given, but monitor INR", and so does anything between the name and the modal that is not name
# material — an apposition ("Warfarin, 5 mg daily, can be given, with one caution") most plausibly.
# Under-counting a verdict lead is the safe direction for a gate whose failure in the other direction
# is fail-open.

# Issue #299. The four ratings DDInter publishes, read on BOTH sides of one comparison — what the
# answer states, and what the chip states — so the two can never be read by different rules.
#
# CAPITALISED, and that is a property of the shipped DATA rather than a guarantee of the code:
# nothing capitalises the rating on the way out (`DdiDrugReferenceSource` carries the KB row's
# `severity` verbatim into the note, and `DrugSafetyValidator.severityRank` lower-cases before
# comparing, so any casing is supported production-side). Measured through the real
# `DdiDrugReferenceSource.parse` of the shipped 19MB KB (never a re-expression of it): over the
# 590,312 interaction links it publishes — the same base CLAUDE.md's own "24,690 Minor-rated
# interaction ROWS" is quoted on, and this measurement reproduces that figure — the severities are
# {Moderate 378,830; Major 101,962; Unknown 84,830; Minor 24,690} and NONE is uncapitalised. That is
# `sourceFormat=ddinter` only. The reason to keep the capital anyway is the answer side: ordinary
# clinical prose says "moderate renal impairment", so a case-folded match would report on a
# resemblance. Over the 20 live cells of this probe captured 2026-08-22, seven answers state a
# capitalised rating and none states a lower-case one.
#
# The accepted costs, stated in both directions as `ClassCodeFidelityCheck` states its own:
#
#   * a lower-cased miscopy in an answer is a silent pass;
#   * a sentence-initial "Moderate …" in an answer is a false report;
#   * `Unknown` is effectively answer-side only. `drugSafety.minInteractionSeverity` defaults to
#     `minor`, which config.xml describes as filtering exactly DDInter's Unknown-severity rows, so no
#     chip on a default-configured capture can carry it and any answer naming it beside a rated chip
#     is reported. It stays in the vocabulary because the floor is an operator setting and an arm
#     captured at `unknown` does raise such chips;
#   * an answer quoting the chart's own ALLERGY severity is reported. OpenMRS's allergy vocabulary
#     (`org.openmrs.AllergySeverity`: UNKNOWN/INTOLERANCE/MILD/MODERATE/SEVERE) collides with
#     DDInter's on `Moderate` and `Unknown`, and the chart renders an allergy as
#     "… Severity: Moderate. Reactions: …" (docs/adr.md, TestDatasetHelper). Every ANSWER cell here is
#     a drug question about a patient whose allergies are in the prompt, so this is a real register,
#     demonstrated on `shipped-clean/joshua__safety-ibuprofen` with its answer REPLACED by one naming
#     "(Severity: Unknown)" — the committed fixture's own answer names no rating at all.
#
# THAT LAST COST IS DELIBERATELY PAID, and a narrowing for it was written and REMOVED. A lookbehind
# refusing a rating directly after "Severity: " was measured fail-open on the metric's own job: a
# labelled-field answer — "Interaction: … Severity: Major. Mechanism: …", the register the chart's
# own "Severity: Severe." rendering invites — then scored 0, so `severity-overstated/` rewritten
# that way exited 0 and its A/B against `severity-concordant/` printed no flip at all. It also
# failed to close the register it was written for, since "Severity:  Major" (two spaces) and
# "**Severity**: Major" walked straight through. So it
# traded a false REPORT for a silent false NEGATIVE on the defect this class exists to catch, which
# is the wrong direction for a net, and it did not even buy the trade. Both registers are now
# reported; `ANSWER_SEVERITY_CASES` pins which is which, including the allergy quote as an accepted
# false report.

# The chip's own rating, read from the DETAIL. Since issue #340 `serializeSafetyWarnings` also emits
# a `severity` key, so the wire is no longer silent — but every capture and every fixture in this
# tree predates that field, so a wire-based read would be inert on all of them and this parse stays
# regardless — the argument this comment itself made before the field existed, which is why #340 left
# the parse alone and corrected only what had become false. It reads the detail,
# where `DrugSafetyValidator.interactionWarning` puts the rule's note straight after an em dash and
# `DdiDrugReferenceSource.noteFor` builds that note as `severity + ". " + mechanism` — so the
# note therefore carries the rating, for `sourceFormat=ddinter`: measured through the real
# `DdiDrugReferenceSource.load()`, of its 590,312 links none carries a null or blank note, none is
# rated with no note, and none has a note that does not start with its own severity word.
#
# THAT MEASUREMENT IS ABOUT THE NOTE, AND NOTHING POSITIONAL ABOUT THE RENDERED DETAIL FOLLOWS FROM
# IT. An earlier revision of this comment said "the leading token after the dash IS the rating" and
# offered the census above as proof; #340 retracted that, because the detail is assembled from chart
# text as well as dataset text and the chart's half goes in UNQUOTED — a free-text prescription
# display can carry the very delimiter the chip appends its note after, which
# `NonCodedDrugOrderNameTest.aFreeTextDisplayIsPrintedIntoTheChipUnquoted` pins as current behaviour.
# This parse is unaffected in practice, and not because the positional claim holds: `CHIP_SEVERITY`
# is applied with `findall` below, so it collects every dash-then-rating in the string rather than
# resting on the first. A `sourceFormat=json` capture is the case it cannot read at all, note and
# severity being independently authored there; that is a second reason a future capture should prefer
# the field where one is present.
#
# Two things follow and both are stated rather than hidden. On `sourceFormat=json` the same position
# holds free operator text, so a curated note opening "Major bleeding risk…" would read as a Major
# rating for a rule the module rates as null; measured harmless for the shipped curated seed, no
# interaction note of which opens with a rating word (read them, rather than trusting a list here —
# an earlier revision named two of the five). And this parses
# clinician-facing prose the module may reword, which is the fault issue #207 exists to have
# removed — so `summarise` reports a census of how many cells carry a READABLE chip rating AND flags
# an arm where that census collapses to zero over interaction chips, because a printed number no
# exit code reads does not close it. Do not read this parse as evidence the wire is the right place
# to look: #340 added the `severity` field precisely so a NEW reader does not have to do this, and
# what keeps the parse here is only that every capture and fixture in this tree predates the field,
# so a wire-based read would be inert on all of them. A capture taken after #340 should prefer the
# field and fall back to this.

    chip post-answer — and the two passes gate identically on the QUESTION (the validator says so at
    `addActiveOrderPairInteractions`), so for the drug asked about they should agree. The union is
    taken rather than either alone because it costs nothing and means no incidental difference
    between the passes — the post-answer one also sees drugs the ANSWER names, and this scorer filters
    both to the drug ASKED about — can license a fabricated verdict by being empty.

    This is the module's own definition of adverse, deliberately, and not a second one the scorer
    keeps: a gate that computes its own notion of "supported" can drift from the layer it is meant to
    hold the answer against, and every extra licence it grants can only turn a flag into a silent
    pass. So the known false-positive mode stays: a chart fact the drug KB cannot resolve is absent
    from both signals, and a correct "No" resting on one gets flagged for a human to read.

    Because it delegates, this predicate does not restate the validator's internals, and must not
    start: two sentences that did were false within days of being written (#179 item 9). They said
    the identity comparison was `allergen == ref` — #164/#187 replaced it with substance-key
    equality — and that a direct allergy to a drug with neither an ATC subgroup nor a curated group
    raises nothing, which #135/#140 fixed by moving that precondition inside the loop, after
    identity. Neither statement changed a score, because the union above reads the module's OUTPUT;
    but both would have misled anyone auditing why a cell was flagged. So the rule for this
    docstring is a pointer, not a paraphrase: the behaviour lives in
    `DrugSafetyValidator.validate(answer, question, patient)` and is pinned by
    `DirectAllergyContraindicationTest` — read those, and do not copy their logic back here.

    The false-positive modes that remain, therefore, are the ones where the drug KB has no way to
    see a chart fact at all: an allergen it cannot resolve to any entry, and a condition-based
    contraindication with no curated rule. A correct "No" resting on either gets flagged for a
    human to read. Cheap: the alternative is the fault #126 records, where the least-supported

    YES direction, and gated even that on `bool(chips)`, so the cell where a verdict is LEAST

    no chip and no finding behind it scored +1 verdict-led, -1 abstained, no flag, exit 0. Read on its

    An empty chip list makes a verdict MORE suspicious here, not exempt. The cells this fires on are

    The first piece of the chip-versus-answer concordance check the module docstring long deferred,

    rifabutin interaction the answer called "a Major problem" — the chip right, the record right, the
    citation right, and the rating a clinician reads wrong.

    **Not a verdict defect, and deliberately not counted as one.** #299 is explicit that this is not
    an issue #283 violation: `moderate` withholds, so "should not be given" was the correct call and
    the cell stays in `verdict_led`. What is wrong is the rating NAMED beside it, which is why this
    is its own column rather than a deduction from that one and why it is not folded into
    `unlicensed_verdict` — that column is about the verdict's direction.

    **Silent when the chips carry no readable rating**, which is the gate that keeps this apart from
    its neighbours: with nothing to be discordant WITH there is nothing to compare, and an answer
    naming a rating over an empty deterministic layer is already `unsupported_no`'s or
    `unsupported_caution`'s cell. Two shapes reach it, and they want opposite treatment. A cell whose
    chips are all UNRATED — a contraindication-only cell, or a class-only duplicate-therapy join — is
    a legitimate silence: the rating cannot have come from a chip OF THIS DRUG, so every place left
    is about something else — the residual false alarms below, all three of them. A cell whose RULE
    chip simply could not be PARSED is not: the comparison did not run, and `summarise`'s collapse
    flag is what says so out loud rather than letting the 0 read as a pass. Measured over the 20
    live cells captured for #299, the gate changes nothing — 2 of the 7 ANSWER cells carry no
    readable rating,
    but neither NAMES a rating either, so neither is silenced by the gate rather than by having
    nothing to compare; and the collapse flag does not fire there, both being cells with no rule
    interaction chip at all. So `severity-unrated-chip/` and `severity-chip-reworded/` pin these,
    not a live number.

    **The limit in the other direction: it is a SET difference over all of the drug's chips.** Where
    a cell has two rated chips the answer may name the wrong one of them and pass — on #299's own
    capture (`Isoniazid / Rifapentine — Moderate` beside `isoniazid — Minor`) an answer quoting the
    rifapentine mechanism and calling it Minor is accepted. Attributing a rating to the chip whose
    sentence it sits in needs clause scoping, which this harness does not do.
    `severity-wrong-chip/` pins it, the way `wrong-partner/` pins its own.

    **The residual false-alarm shape, named rather than narrowed.** The chip side is scoped to the
    drug asked about; the answer side is the whole answer. So a cell whose chips ARE rated, whose
    answer names one of those ratings correctly and ALSO names another it read off a cited
    `drug_reference` record about a different partner, is reported with nothing misstated. That the
    answers do read ratings off those records is measured — `betty__safety-clarithromycin` states
    *"a Major interaction [238]"* about ivosidenib, citing a `drug_reference` — but no live cell
    combines it with a rated chip, so the shape is reasoned rather than observed and no fixture
    pins it. An injected `safety_finding` about a DIFFERENT drug is the same shape — the screening
    arm raises findings whose subject is another active order, and `renderFinding` puts each one's
    rating word into the prompt as a numbered citation. And the NEAREST source is a third of the
    same shape: another CHIP in this very response, for a different drug. `load` narrows the chip
    side to `mine` on purpose — the validator also raises warnings for drugs the answer happens to
    name, and one of those must not label this cell — but those warnings are on the wire in
    `safetyWarnings` and can be rated, so an answer correctly quoting one is reported with nothing
    misstated. Its epistemic status is the other two's, reasoned and not observed: read it off the
    fixtures rather than off a count here — group each capture's `safetyWarnings` by their `drug`
    field and look for a cell naming more than one — which is the same scan the narrowing itself
    would have to be justified by. Left un-narrowed for
    `ClassCodeFidelityCheck`'s reason: for all three the narrowing available is clause scoping —
    attributing the rating to the clause it sits in — which this harness does not do, and for the
    two record-borne shapes the capture carries no record text to subtract in the first place.
    Widening the chip side to every chip is NOT the narrowing for the third: it is fail-open, since
    an answer overstating THIS drug's Moderate as Major would then be excused by any other drug's
    Major chip. `mine` stays as it is.

    ten findings from the screening arm and cited none of them while naming all eight of her active

    # the reworded cell carried a real overstatement, scoring 0 at exit 0. And keying on the TYPE

    # than as "contains `interacts with`") is measured.

    # A curated hand-authored rule IS caught by this, and should be: its chip is a rule chip and is

    # passed. A json arm whose ANSWER cells raise no rule chip at all (contraindication-only,
    # class-only, own-drug) is unaffected.

    # PER CELL is not per CHIP, and the residue is here rather than left to be found: a cell holding

# The caution lead's own cases, in the shape score_directness.selftest uses for classify, and here
# for the reason that one is there: every fixture arm exercises the lead in the POSITIVE direction
# only, so the failure CAUTION_LEAD_TAIL's comment is written against — a hedge reading as a
# caution verdict — is pinned by nothing without these. Without a count deliberately: this sentence
# said "the two fixture arms" and went stale the moment a third was added. Each case carries the
# DRUG its cell would be about, resolved through the production `_aliases`, because the lead is
# anchored on it.
#
# The negatives are where the work is: a "Yes" that must stay a YES so inverted_yes still fires on
# it, a caution named past the first sentence, a cell with no drug at all, and the hedges that reach
# neither classify nor ABSTAINED. None came from a capture — four are the first review round's, eleven
# are the second's, the rest work the sentence, prefix and anchor boundaries — and no fixture arm pins
# any of them.
#
# Two pairs are the ones to keep together. The `if` pair ("it is not known IF … can be given, so
# caution applies" against "can be given, with caution IF monitored") is what only marker scoping
# separates. And the anchor pair ("Presumably warfarin can be given, with caution" against "Warfarin
# can be given, with caution if monitored") is what only the anchor separates: the first subordinates
# nothing, so no marker list of any length reaches it.
