"""Temporal DB-truth probe (rc.2 standalone): does the answer to a "most recent X" /
"when was the last Y" question quote the NEWEST matching record in the database?

Reconstruction of the (previously uncommitted) probe behind ADR Decision 28's
"Temporal DB-truth probe: scoped 15/15 vs fullChart 14/15" — committed this time so the
mandatory gate is reproducible. 15 cells = 3 temporal questions x the 5 rc.2 eval patients
(same patients as capture_eval_rc2.sh / build_gold_rc2.py PINNED).

Per cell:
  truth   = newest unvoided value/date via SQL (weight obs, systolic obs, last clinical contact)
  answer  = POST /chartsearchai/search (whatever chartMode the server is in)
  PASS    = the truth value appears in the answer. The "last visit" cell accepts the newest
            visit-table date OR the newest encounter date: the VISITS typed scope deliberately
            carries both record types (ADR Decision 28), both are real clinical-contact dates,
            and this install has encounters outside any visit — so either is a faithful
            reading of "last visit". For a patient with NO matching records, PASS = the
            answer cites nothing and reads as an abstention (no fabricated number).
Cells the mechanical check cannot settle print as REVIEW with the full answer, rather than
being silently counted either way.

Env: MARIADB_BIN (bundled client), MYSQL_PWD, MARIADB_PORT (default 3316),
     OPENMRS_REST (default http://localhost:8081/openmrs/ws/rest/v1), OPENMRS_AUTH.
Usage: temporal_probe_rc2.py [outdir]   (outdir keeps per-cell JSON for the record)
