"""Live grounding harness for a codes-only `active_drug_order` record (issue #294).

Answers the question #294 asks — does a real query publish `grounded=false` for an
injected active-order record whose display names no drug, and how often — on the RUNNING
standalone, over the full production path (real querystore retrieval, real LLM answer,
real Tier-1 e5 cosine and real Tier-2 entailment). No stub can answer it: whether such a
record's real embedding clears `chartsearchai.grounding.minCosine`, and whether a real
model makes a medication claim about a record that names no drug, are both properties of
systems this repo does not implement.

It reuses `grounding_scope_ab.py`'s `get_gp`/`set_gp`/`req` and its `verdict_tag`. It does
NOT use that module's `search`, and the reason is worth stating because the obvious reading
is that it should: `search` returns verdicts keyed by citation INDEX, and this measurement
has to find one record by `resourceUuid` — the index is whatever the injector happened to
number it. So the body is read here, but the TAGGING is not respelled — every citation below
goes through `verdict_tag`, so the rules that make `attachedByTheModule` (#305) and a
`reference` group (#201) read as something other than "unverified" are edited in one place,
and a rename of either wire key reaches this file with them. That holds only while this file
spells none of those keys itself, which is why `cell` dumps the TAG for the record it is
looking for and not the raw fields the tag is computed from — the comment there says what
a raw read would print instead.

## The arrangement has to be built, and none was found on the database used

Measured on the RefApp 3.7.1 pool database: 53 active drug orders across 30 patients, of
which 0 were codes-only. **Read that zero with what produced it**: a SQL sweep over those
columns and the ATC map, which RE-EXPRESSES `addDrugName`'s predicate rather than calling it,
and `Concept.getName()` can return null for a concept that still has name rows — so the sweep
can only UNDERCOUNT, the direction that turns a real instance into a reported zero. It is
therefore weak in the direction of the claim it would support, and production's own instrument
(the builder's per-order "has no readable name" WARN over a sweep of patients) would settle it
and was not run. ADR Decision 38's owed-measurement section carries this with the rest of the
run. Such an order needs BOTH halves, and neither was found to occur naturally there:

  * nameless in all three sources `addDrugName` reads — no coded drug, no `drug_non_coded`
    free text, and no unvoided name on its concept — AND carrying at least one ATC code,
    since an order with neither name nor code is skipped entirely; and
  * UNREPRESENTED: the retrieved chart is complete for `drug_order` yet holds no record for
    that order, i.e. the querystore index is behind for it. That is what
    `DrugReferenceInjector.unrepresentedActiveOrders` WARNs about, and it is environmental.

**Build it as a NEW order on a concept carrying no other order, obs or drug row.** The
obvious shortcut — change an existing order's uuid so its own indexed record stops
matching — leaves that record in the chart as a NAMED TWIN for the same prescription, and
the twin changes the outcome: with it the model cited the injected record (in a sentence
that names no drug, which the record entails, so `true`), and without it the model did not
cite the record at all. ADR Decision 38's owed-measurement section records both runs. A
run that does not say which arrangement it used is not interpretable.

**Confirm the injection from the server log, not from the citation.** An uncited record is
not an unrejected one, and the two are indistinguishable on the wire. The reconciliation
WARN ("Active-order reconciliation: N of M ... Unrepresented: [[ATC ...]") is the evidence
that the record reached the prompt at all.

Usage:
    BASE=http://localhost:8082/openmrs/ws/rest/v1 OMRS_USER=admin OMRS_PASS=... \
        PATIENT=<uuid> ORDER_UUID=<uuid of the codes-only order> \
        python3 codes_only_order_grounding.py [regimes|probes|all]

The regime grid is `entailment.enabled` on/off x `minCosine` 0.40 (shipped) and 0.82 (the
value this module's own global-property text advises for e5), one question held fixed. The
probes are ordinary questions a clinician would ask — what the patient is on, how many orders
there are, whether a drug is safe to add. They are the half that tests whether the injected
record reaches the answer at all.
