"""Live grounding harness for a codes-only `active_drug_order` record (issue #294).

It was written to ANSWER #294's question — does a real query publish `grounded=false` for an
injected active-order record whose display names no drug — and it did: yes, under entailment,
on a sentence the record supports. ADR Decision 38's owed-measurement section carries that run.

**Since the remedy (ADR Decision 93) it is a REGRESSION harness, and what it looks for has
inverted.** Such a citation is now `Disposition.UNVERIFIABLE`: the module publishes no verdict
for it in either mode. So in the `codes_only_record` block below, `true` or `false` is a
REGRESSION — the remedy has been lost — and `null` is the expected reading. Do not read that
`null` as a clean bill of health on its own: grounding being off, the record going uncited, or
the request failing all print `null` too, which is why the block distinguishes "NOT CITED" from
a cited record with no verdict, and why the regime grid still varies entailment and the floor.

Everything below still runs on the RUNNING standalone over the full production path (real
querystore retrieval, real LLM answer, real Tier-1 e5 cosine and real Tier-2 entailment),
because the thing that would signal a regression is the same thing no stub can produce: whether
a real model makes a medication claim about a record that names no drug, and what the pipeline
then publishes for it end to end.

It reuses `grounding_scope_ab.py`'s `get_gp`/`set_gp`/`req` and its `verdict_tag`. It does
NOT use that module's `search`, and the reason is worth stating because the obvious reading
is that it should: `search` returns verdicts keyed by citation INDEX, and this measurement
has to find one record by `resourceUuid` — the index is whatever the injector happened to
number it. So the body is read here, but the TAGGING is not respelled — every citation below
goes through `verdict_tag`, so the rules that make `attachedByTheModule` (#305) and a
`reference` group (#201) read as something other than "unverified" are edited in one place,
and a rename of either wire key reaches this file with them. That holds only while this file
spells none of those keys itself, which is why `cell` dumps the TAG for the record it is
looking for and not the raw fields the tag is computed from — the comment there says what
a raw read would print instead.

## The arrangement has to be built, and none was found on the database used

Measured on the RefApp 3.7.1 pool database: 53 active drug orders across 30 patients, of
which 0 were codes-only. **Read that zero with what produced it**: a SQL sweep over those
columns and the ATC map, which RE-EXPRESSES `addDrugName`'s predicate rather than calling it,
and `Concept.getName()` can return null for a concept that still has name rows — so the sweep
can only UNDERCOUNT, the direction that turns a real instance into a reported zero. It is
therefore weak in the direction of the claim it would support, and production's own instrument
(the builder's per-order "has no readable name" WARN over a sweep of patients) would settle it
and was not run. ADR Decision 38's owed-measurement section carries this with the rest of the
run. Such an order needs BOTH halves, and neither was found to occur naturally there:

  * nameless in all three sources `addDrugName` reads — no coded drug, no `drug_non_coded`
    free text, and no unvoided name on its concept — AND carrying at least one ATC code,
    since an order with neither name nor code is skipped entirely; and
  * UNREPRESENTED: the retrieved chart is complete for `drug_order` yet holds no record for
    that order, i.e. the querystore index is behind for it. That is what
    `DrugReferenceInjector.unrepresentedActiveOrders` WARNs about, and it is environmental.

**Build it as a NEW order on a concept carrying no other order, obs or drug row.** The
obvious shortcut — change an existing order's uuid so its own indexed record stops
matching — leaves that record in the chart as a NAMED TWIN for the same prescription, and
the twin changes the outcome: with it the model cited the injected record (in a sentence
that names no drug, which the record entails, so `true`), and without it the model did not
cite the record at all. ADR Decision 38's owed-measurement section records both runs. A
run that does not say which arrangement it used is not interpretable.

**Confirm the injection from the server log, not from the citation.** An uncited record is
not an unrejected one, and the two are indistinguishable on the wire. The reconciliation
WARN ("Active-order reconciliation: N of M ... Unrepresented order(s): [<order uuid>]") is
the evidence that the record reached the prompt at all. It names the order by uuid since
ADR Decision 102 (a drug name in that line was PHI), so the uuid to look for is the
`ORDER_UUID` this script already takes.

Usage:
    BASE=http://localhost:8082/openmrs/ws/rest/v1 OMRS_USER=admin OMRS_PASS=... \
        PATIENT=<uuid> ORDER_UUID=<uuid of the codes-only order> \
        python3 codes_only_order_grounding.py [regimes|probes|all]

The regime grid is `entailment.enabled` on/off x `minCosine` 0.40 (shipped) and 0.82 (the
value this module's own global-property text advises for e5), one question held fixed. The
probes are ordinary questions a clinician would ask — what the patient is on, how many orders
there are, whether a drug is safe to add. They are the half that tests whether the injected
record reaches the answer at all.
