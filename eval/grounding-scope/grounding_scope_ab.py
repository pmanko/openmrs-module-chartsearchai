"""Live grounding-scope A/B harness for chartsearchai (measure-first gate).

Measures how citation grounding verdicts change between scoping modes on the
RUNNING standalone, for a fixed (patient, query) set. This is the measurement
gate for any change to CitationGroundingVerifier's sentence/clause scoping —
it exercises the FULL production grounding path (real querystore retrieval, the
real LLM answer, and the real batched Tier-2 entailment), which is essential
because the clause-scoping regression is an emergent BATCH-COUPLING effect that
no stubbed unit test can reproduce.

For each (patient, query) case it runs POST /chartsearchai/search under each
value of the `chartsearchai.grounding.clauseScoped` GP and records, per cited
index, whatever the wire published for it. Sentence-scope (clauseScoped=false) is the SAFE
baseline. Versus it:
  * a True->False flip is a REGRESSION candidate (e.g. patient 165497e8
    "any feeding problems?" cite [5], a provisional-diagnosis false negative);
  * a False->True flip is a WIN candidate (e.g. "any ear problems?" cite [89]).

Since issue #302 a chart citation's null has a NEW CAUSE on the sentence-scope
side (null was always publishable -- see the caveat below -- so what changed is
why), and a gate that reads a verdict has to know about it or it fails open. A COMPOUND claim unit -- more than one citation
with claim text between two of its markers -- publishes no verdict at all: it
skips Tier-2, no Tier-1 cosine is computed for publication, and the cell reads
null whichever way either tier would have answered. So the sentence column now carries null for
exactly the population clause-scoping targets. That includes this harness's own
named win case, cite [89] on "any ear problems?", if the model answers it in the
compound-sentence form the clauseScoped setting is documented against -- run it
and read the cell rather than assuming, since the answer is regenerated each
time. Read for True/False flips alone, a tally would go to zero wherever that
happens and the gate would print a pass it had not measured. Hence the null-side
classes below -- three counted and a fourth deliberately not -- printed separately
rather than folded in:
  * null->True is a WIN of the demoted kind (sentence scope could not certify
    the citation, clause scope can);
  * True->null is a REGRESSION of the demoted kind;
  * null->False is a REGRESSION too, and it is the one that matters most here:
    it is the candidate scoping PUBLISHING the unsupported badge that #302
    removed. Expect it on the two medication cases below, whose clause-scoped
    cumulative prefix for the second citation still names the first drug -- so
    without this class a scoping that reinstates #302's own symptom scores
    demoted_wins=1, demoted_regressions=0 and the gate prints a pass.
  * False->null is left UNCOUNTED on purpose: sentence scope published a flag
    and clause scope withheld it, which is a loss of signal rather than a wrong
    verdict. Note it can no longer arise from a COMPOUND unit -- that cell is
    null on the sentence side now, not False -- so what remains here is the
    other causes of a sentence-side False.

The #302 withholding is gated on entailment, and the module ships
chartsearchai.grounding.entailment.enabled=false. With it off, none of the three
null-side classes can fire for that reason at all and the demoted tallies are
measuring something else, so the harness reads both grounding properties at
startup, prints them beside the baseline line, and says so in the output rather
than leaving a reader to assume which regime produced the numbers.

What the wire cannot tell you even with entailment on: a chart null may also mean
"not checked" -- no record text, an embedding failure, Tier-2 cap overflow with no
Tier-1 verdict. This harness does not separate those from a #302 withholding, so read
a null-side count as an upper bound on the demoted kind, not as a measurement of
it.

Issue #294 adds a cause that is NOT on the entailment gate and so is present in
both arms: a citation of an injected active-order record the module could read
no drug name for publishes no verdict at all. It reads on the wire as a plain
`None`, indistinguishable from "not checked" -- no wire field marks the shape --
so it is one more unnamed contributor to a null-side count. It moves no A/B class,
both arms being null. Do NOT discount it the way the paragraph below discounts
#284: most of the cases below are condition-shaped, but the last two ask what
medications the patient is taking, which is the question shape that cites an
injected active-order record. So this cause is MORE likely to appear here than
that one, not less.

Issue #284 adds one more cause of a sentence-side null, on the same entailment
gate: a chart citation whose claim also rests on a module-supplied safety
finding has the judge's NEGATIVE withheld. So a null-side count is an upper
bound over that too, and this harness cannot attribute a cell between the two.
Most of its cases are condition-shaped rather than drug-safety questions, so a
finding is unlikely to be injected for those -- but that has not been re-measured,
and "unlikely" is not "cannot". It said "six cases" until the #294 sweep counted
them: CASES holds EIGHT, and the last two are medication questions, which is the
shape this discount is weakest for. Do not restate the count; read it off CASES. Do not quote a tally here over a change to the
#284 rule.

Only the MODEL's own CHART-group citations are measurable here. A reference-group
citation publishes no verdict at all (issue #201), so its cells read `withheld`;
and since issue #305 a chart-group citation the MODULE attached carries none
either, so its cells read `attached` (both tags are set in `verdict_tag`,
whose docstring says why neither may be printed as None). A scoping flip on
either cannot be seen from the wire, so the gate below is a statement about
the model's own chart citations.

The GP is saved before and restored after. Answers are grounding-independent,
so a differing answer between modes signals LLM nondeterminism (reported).

Before any GP is read, every cohort patient is looked up on the instance, and the run REFUSES
when one does not resolve (#240). The arms are switched by writing a GP, so without that check an
absent cohort changed the instance's configuration and measured nothing, with only the
best-effort restore in `run`'s finally to put it back. `--selftest` pins that ordering offline.

    rules — so a rename of either wire key below lands in one place.

    A reference-group citation's `grounded` is always null on the wire, whatever the pass
    concluded (issue #201), so a clause-scope flip on one is NOT observable from here. Those
    cells are tagged `withheld` rather than printed as None, which would read as "unverified"
    and let a caller's gate be quoted over citations it is structurally blind to. The tallies in
    `run` are unaffected because `withheld` is a STRING: the True/False classes cannot match it,
    and the #302 null-side classes test `is None`. Do not change the tag to None — the null->False
    class would then start counting withheld reference citations as #302 regressions. ("every class
    needs a True on one side" was the old reason and it is no longer true: null->False needs none.)

    `attached` is a third tag for the same reason: since issue #305 a chart-group citation the
    MODULE attached carries grounded=null because there is no claim of the model's to check, and
    printing that as None reads as "unverified" — the distinction that whole issue turns on. A
    STRING again, so the True/False classes cannot match it and the #302 null-side classes, which
    test `is None`, cannot either; every counted class tests `is True` or `is False` on at least one
    side, so no tally moves. Do not tag it None.

    It deliberately does NOT share drift-metric's `model_cited` predicate, which is the one home
    of the rule for the scorers that EXCLUDE such a citation. This directory tags rather than
    excludes — the cell still has to appear in the per-cell table a human reads — so a shared
