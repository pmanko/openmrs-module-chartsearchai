"""KV-prefill MEASUREMENT: how much first-query latency would a KV prewarm remove?

This is a measurement with a hard precondition, not a pass/fail gate — it reports a delta
and has no ship bar to compare it against, despite the `_gate` in its filename. What it
DOES now enforce, and exits non-zero on, is its own precondition: that the "cold" arm is
actually cold. Read the delta; do not read exit 0 as a verdict.

For each patient, on a fresh llama-server process (empty RAM prompt-cache pool):
  1. reindex (warm the querystore index WITHOUT touching the LLM, so the cold reading
     isolates LLM prefill, not the ~42s lazy index)
  2. delete the patient's on-disk KV .bin -> the next query is a GENUINE cold full prefill
  3. cold  /search/stream  -> record the `prefill` phase (t0 -> first output)
  4. warm  /search/stream  (different question, same patient: KV prefix now RAM-resident)
                           -> record the `prefill` phase again
  delta = prefill_cold - prefill_warm  == exactly what ANY prewarm (reactive or bootstrap)
  could remove from a first query. This is the number the prewarm-bootstrap decision hinges on.

WHY THE PRECONDITION IS THE WHOLE POINT (#179 item 7). Step 2 is the only thing making the
cold arm cold, and its result was thrown away: `delete_kv(uuid)` returned a count that no
caller read, and `KVDIR` was a hardcoded absolute path into a `3.7.0-SNAPSHOT` install that
no longer exists on this box. A wrong directory therefore deleted nothing, every "cold" arm
ran against a warm on-disk cache, and the script printed a small, believable, entirely
fabricated DELTA — the failure mode where the instrument reports success because it never
did anything. Measured 2026-08-09: the old constant resolved to a directory that is absent,
while the real cache held 8 `.bin` files, 4 of them for corpus patients. So it would have
deleted nothing for every patient, silently.

Now: KVDIR is resolved from CHARTSEARCHAI_KVDIR (falling back to the 3.7.1 standalone), and
before ANY request is made the directory must exist, hold at least one `.bin`, and hold one
for every patient about to be measured — see `require_cold_cache_dir`. The per-patient check
is up front rather than in the loop so a worthless reading costs nothing to discover instead
of a 300s streaming pair, and the loop still prints each deleted count so a zero is visible.

That third condition is not hypothetical either. Measured 2026-08-09 against the real cache:
all SIX patients below have no `.bin`, so this cohort is as stale as the path was. The run
now refuses and names them instead of reporting a median over six warm "cold" arms.

Run against the live standalone on :8081. Prints a per-patient table + median delta.

Usage: kv_prefill_gate.py
       kv_prefill_gate.py --selftest   (precondition checks only; needs no server and no LLM)
