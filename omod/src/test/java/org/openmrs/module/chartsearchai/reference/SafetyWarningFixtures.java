/**
 * Builds a {@link SafetyWarning} through a factory or method {@code SafetyWarning} keeps
 * package-private — or, for the order stamp, {@code DrugSafetyValidator.currentMedicationOrdersOn}, which
 * issue #552 made package-private for this class — for an omod test that cannot reach one from
 * {@code org.openmrs.module.chartsearchai.web.rest}.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it exists, and why it is not a widening of production API.</b> The chip-serialization
 * guards live in {@code web.rest}, and the facts these shapes carry are set only through
 * {@code SafetyWarning}'s package-private factories and methods, and the order stamp through
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.currentMedicationOrdersOn}. This class is declared in their OWN package under
 * {@code omod/src/test}, so it reaches them with no production change beyond that one package-private
 * visibility — a split package across two artifacts being legal on a plain classpath, which is what
 * surefire gives these tests.
 *
 * <p><b>The point is that the chip is one PRODUCTION built.</b> Two alternatives were available — a
 * new public factory taking the flag, and an anonymous subclass overriding the accessor — and both are
 * weaker. ADR Decision 92 records the comparison and is canonical for it.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately NOT a general-purpose chip builder: it exposes only the shapes the wire guards need,
 * so it cannot become a second way to assemble the chips {@code DrugSafetyValidator} assembles.
