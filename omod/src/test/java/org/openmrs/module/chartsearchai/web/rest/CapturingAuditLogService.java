/**
 * {@link StubAuditLogService} that RETAINS what the controller wrote, for the test classes whose
 * assertions are about the audit row itself.
 *
 * <p>Shared rather than nested per test class, for the reason {@code StubAuditLogService}'s own
 * javadoc gives about itself and {@code RestControllerContext}'s repeats: {@code AuditLogService} has
 * six methods, and with a copy per test file a seventh would have to be added in every copy, letting
 * two files quietly pin different answers to the same question. Issue #229 was about to add a second
 * copy — one capturing saves only, one additionally serving a listing back — which is the drift those
 * two javadocs were written against, so it was promoted here instead. Before that there was one, and
 * it was nested in {@code ChartSearchAiAuditSearchModeTest}.
 *
 * <p>{@link #saved} is what {@code saveAuditLog} was called with, in order. {@link #listed} is what
 * the listing endpoint is served; it is empty by default, so a class that only cares about saves gets
 * the base class's behaviour unchanged.
