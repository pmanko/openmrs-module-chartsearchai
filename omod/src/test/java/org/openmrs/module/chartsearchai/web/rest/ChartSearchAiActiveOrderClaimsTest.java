 * order they were offered for, and its {@code []} could not be read alone — ADR Decision 81 carries
 * the two live runs behind that. The first case below states the two keys together for that reason.

 * pinned one layer down by {@code ActiveOrderCitationFidelityTest}, which drives the real
 * orchestration. Here the subject is the wire: that the key reaches every surface, that each number
 * lands under its own name rather than the other's, that a zeroed statement and no statement survive
 * as themselves, and that it marshals for an XML client.
