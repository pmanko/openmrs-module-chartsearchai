/**
 * Issue #178 — what the {@code chartsearchai_audit_log} row actually records as its search mode.
 *
 * <p>Both audit-write sites used to branch on the {@code chartsearchai.embedding.preFilter} global
 * property alone, so {@code queryScoped} — the shipped {@code chartsearchai.chartMode} default —
 * could not appear in the column at all: every row on a default install said {@code full-chart}
 * while the prompt carried a query-scoped slice. A maintainer reading these rows to reconstruct
 * what a clinician was shown was reading a constant, and an A/B between the two chart modes could
 * not be told apart in the log at all.
 *
 * <p>These assertions are on the row the controller PERSISTS, not on any projection of it, and they
 * cover both write sites: the blocking {@code /search} handler and the streaming orchestration in
 * each of its two shapes (the classic single {@code done}, and the async-grounding early
 * {@code done} that audits the ungrounded answer instead of the returned one). Two sites deriving
 * the mode separately is how they came to disagree, so the fix is that neither derives it — the
 * answer states it and the controller writes what it is told.
