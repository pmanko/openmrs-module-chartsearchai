 *
 * <p><b>What this class covers and what it does not.</b> It covers the payload — that a finding
 * reaches a client shaped exactly as the {@code /search} chips are, that {@code screened} travels
 * beside it, and that the patient-resolution failures answer as {@code /search}'s do. What it leaves
 * to the api suite is whether the real arms compute the right findings at all, which
 * {@code StandingChartAlertsTest} drives through the real validator over a real parsed dataset. The
 * seam is the same one {@link ChartSearchAiSafetyWarningSeverityWireTest} uses and for the reason its
 * javadoc gives: {@code omod/pom.xml} declares no {@code chartsearchai-api} test-jar, so the fixtures
 * that drive the real {@code DrugSafetyValidator} are not reachable from here.
 *
 * <p>The stub overrides the ONE method the handler calls, and returns all three of its states through
 * it — see {@link StandingScreen}, whose middle state is the only arrangement on which {@code screened}
 * and the emptiness of {@code alerts} disagree, and so the only one that can tell a handler PUBLISHING
 * the verdict from one deriving it from the list. That the handler makes one call is itself the
 * contract: the flag and the list come back together, so neither can answer for a different pass than
 * the other. {@link #anUnscreenedInstallSaysSoRatherThanReportingAnEmptyChart} is the case that would
 * be missing if {@code screened} were dropped, and it is the reason the key exists.
