/**
 * A chip says which of the patient's own prescriptions its substance came from, ON THE WIRE (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/347">#347</a>).
 *
 * <p>Measured on the 3.7.1 standalone before this change: one response named one active order two
 * ways. The answer prose called it {@code active order Advil} — the brand its cited
 * {@code drug_order} record renders — while every chip called it {@code active order Ibuprofen},
 * the knowledge base's substance. Neither name is false, and the chip side must not be re-decided
 * (#339's reverted rounds 5-6, and CLAUDE.md), so what the response was missing is the
 * CORRESPONDENCE. A clinician reading the chip list beside the answer had to decide whether
 * {@code Advil} and {@code Ibuprofen} were one prescription or two, and on that chart the wrong
 * answer was available — she was also on {@code Aspirin 81mg}, so "three NSAIDs" read as plausible.
 *
 * <p>The module states the correspondence in the prompt too, as a clause inside the injected
 * {@code safety_finding} ({@code DrugReferenceInjector.FINDING_CHART_ORDER_LEAD}, and
 * {@code OneOrderNameAcrossAnswerAndChipTest} is that half). That is not enough on its own and the
 * repo has already measured why: a prompt record reaches a client only if the MODEL cites it, and on
 * #354's own reproduction it did not, so nothing a {@code /search} consumer read reported the fact
 * at all. Hence this key — the same settlement {@code unresolvedDrugClass} reached, one issue along.
 *
 * <p>It rides INSIDE each chip rather than beside the chip array, which is what makes "it reaches
 * every emission surface" true by construction: {@code putSafetyChips} is already the one writer of
 * {@code safetyWarnings} and {@code ChartSearchAiInteractionPairExtentTest} fails the build on a
 * second one. The last case here holds the other half of that — that the key is written from the
 * chip's own bridges at one place, so a site building the chip array for itself cannot omit it.

	 *
	 * <p>Structural rather than behavioural, and that is the point: the drift it catches has no
	 * observable value to assert. A field added here with no getter is published to an XML client and
	 * to nobody else, with {@link #theTwoHalvesAreSeparateFieldsAndNotASentenceToParse} (which reads

	 * — CLAUDE.md cites {@code CoMedicationResolutionPerPassTest} for a field budget read the same
	 * way.
	 *
	 * <p>It is ONE-directional, deliberately: a field implies a getter, never the converse. A derived
	 * getter over no field of its own would become a JSON field an XML client does not receive, which
	 * is a divergence in the other direction and one this class's JSON case already sees, since it
	 * asserts the field COUNT.
	 *
	 * <p>Static and synthetic members are excluded — {@code static} because XStream does not marshal
	 * one, and synthetic because a compiler writes {@code this$0} and jacoco writes
	 * {@code $jacocoData} into classes that never declared them.
