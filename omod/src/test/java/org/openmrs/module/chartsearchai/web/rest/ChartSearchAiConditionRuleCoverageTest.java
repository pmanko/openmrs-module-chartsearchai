/**
 * The wire half of issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/378">#378</a>: what the
 * loaded dataset publishes for the hand-authored CONDITION-rule arm, on every surface that carries
 * an answer.
 *
 * <p>Under the shipped {@code sourceFormat=ddinter} default that arm is {@code absent} — its
 * condition leg has no rule to evaluate, so a patient's recorded conditions are put to nothing — and
 * before this key nothing a {@code /search} consumer reads could tell that from a screen that asked
 * and found nothing, while {@code interactionPairs} beside it stated a completeness the interaction
 * arm genuinely had. That asymmetry, visible in a single payload, is the issue.
 *
 * <p>What these cases do NOT pin is the verdict itself; that is
 * {@code LlmInferenceServiceConditionRuleCoverageContextTest} and
 * {@code ShippedDrugReferenceDefaultTest} in the api module, over a real load. Here the subject is
 * the SERIALIZATION — that the key reaches all three surfaces, spells the verdict the way
 * {@code /chartsearchai/drugreferencestatus} spells it, and is written in one place.
