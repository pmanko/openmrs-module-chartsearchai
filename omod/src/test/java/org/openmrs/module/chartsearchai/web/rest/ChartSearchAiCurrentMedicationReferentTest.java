/**
 * A safety chip says whether the module raised it from one of the patient's own active orders (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/527">#527</a>).
 *
 * <p>Asked "any allergies?", the module checks her active orders against her recorded allergies, and a
 * chip raised that way is about a medication she already takes. Asked "can I give her ibuprofen?" of a
 * patient on no ibuprofen, the same allergen arm raises a chip about a drug being proposed. Both carry
 * one sentence, "The patient has a recorded allergy to Ibuprofen.", and on the issue's reproduction both
 * reached the client as one byte-identical object. The module held the difference on
 * {@code SafetyWarning.isAboutACurrentMedication()}; on the model's path it stated it in the injected
 * record, which reaches a client only if the model cites it — and there it did not.
 *
 * <p><b>Pairs, each one sentence carried by two chips that differ only in that answer.</b> So a value
 * computed from the other published fields cannot agree with both chips of a pair. The contraindication
 * pair is the issue's own. The rule-interaction pair is the screening arm's rated chip beside the
 * drug-in-play arm's, and is here so that a value narrowed by chip TYPE cannot agree with every chip; both
 * of its chips carry a non-empty {@code namedPartners}, as every chip
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.interactionWarning} builds does, so a value narrowed on it cannot either. The
 * shared-substance pair is issue #477's two findings, an UNRATED interaction naming SEVERAL orders, so a
 * value narrowed to rated chips, or to chips naming at most one order, cannot agree either. The caution
 * pair is a second rule-interaction pair, rated Moderate where the first is rated Major — a caution beside
 * a finding that withholds, as {@code DrugSafetyValidator.licensesWithholding} answers, which is the
 * STRENGTH axis ADR Decision 118 keeps apart from the referent. So a value narrowed to leave out the
 * unrated chips, the Major one or the Moderate one cannot agree with every chip, and publishing the
 * referent only where the finding withholds is such a value; one leaving out only a rating no chip here
 * carries, Minor among them, is not ruled out. The caution pair's chips also carry a chart-order bridge,
 * so a value narrowed on whether a chip carries one cannot agree either. Each pair's {@code true} chip is
 * a population a narrowing to the others would drop unseen — ADR Decision 92's lesson (issue #412) — and
 * {@code ChartSearchAiSafetyWarningSeverityWireTest}'s reflective guard holds another, a curated rule's.
 *
 * <p>What is not asserted here, because something else holds it. That the published value is the
 * accessor's own reading, over a fixture of its own:
 * {@code ChartSearchAiSafetyWarningSeverityWireTest.everyPublicZeroArgumentAccessorOfAWarningNamesAKeyOnTheWire}.
 * That the key reaches {@code GET /chartsearchai/chartalerts}:
 * {@code ChartSearchAiChartAlertsTest.everyFindingIsShapedExactlyAsASearchChipIs}, which reads the key set
 * off a {@code /search} chip. And that the real arms give the chips the wire publishes this answer on the
 * issue's own shape: {@code LlmInferenceServiceCurrentMedicationReferentContextTest}, in the api module,
 * which this module's tests cannot reach.
