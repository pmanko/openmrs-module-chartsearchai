 * running module instead of from a log line that, because the load is lazy, may belong to an earlier
 * load or an earlier process.
 *
 * <p>It is pinned here rather than only live because the endpoint contributes one field of its own
 * ({@code enabled}) that no API-level test can see, and because its privilege gate is the only thing
 * standing between an unprivileged caller and both a filesystem path and a 19 MB parse. The
 * controller is driven as a POJO with its {@link DrugReferenceService} set through the same
 * package-private test seam the file already uses for its three other autowired collaborators.

	 * <p>{@code findings} joined this list for the load-time validity check (issues
	 * #150/#156/#196/#211). It belongs on the wire for the same reason the rest of this response does:
	 * the endpoint answers "what is actually loaded?" after a lazy load, and "what was wrong with it, and
	 * what did the loader do about it?" is that same question — retained in Java and withheld here, the
	 * check would be visible to tests and invisible to the operator it protects.
	 *
	 * <p>{@code arms} joined it afterwards, for issue #285, and for that same reason: a dataset can load
	 * 2283 entries and still leave the dosing and hand-authored-rule arms with nothing to act on. Prose
	 * said so for the shipped DEFAULT in several places; what none of it can describe is the dataset a
	 * given install configured for itself, which is what this field answers.
	 *
	 * <p>{@code crossReactivity} joined it for issue #266, and it is the first key describing a DIFFERENT
	 * dataset. The curated cross-reactivity groups load from a global property of their own, alongside
	 * whatever {@code sourceFormat} is in force, and their validity findings reached only the log — so
	 * {@code configured-data-file-not-read} for that file was invisible on the one channel that can
	 * answer after a lazy load. Its own subsection rather than rows in the top-level {@code findings},
	 * because a finding naming a file has to be read beside the file it is about (ADR Decision 48).
	 *
	 * <p>A new key is APPENDED, never inserted — that is what keeps this an ORDERED assertion instead of
	 * an order-insensitive one, and the rule is the append rather than whichever key is last today.
