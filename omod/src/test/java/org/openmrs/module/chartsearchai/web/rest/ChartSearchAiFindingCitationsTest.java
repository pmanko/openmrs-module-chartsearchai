 * <p>It is the base its four neighbours needed and none of them is: each of those judges a finding
 * the answer DID cite, so on the reported response — six findings stated of seven carried — not one
 * of them reported the dropped finding. The first case below states this key beside the two whose
 * empty lists were the misleading part, and asserts those as PRECONDITIONS rather than as results.
 *
 * <p>What the two numbers MEAN is canonical at {@code ChartSearchService.FindingCitationExtent} and
 * pinned one layer down by {@code SafetyFindingCitationExtentTest}, which drives the real
 * orchestration. Here the subject is the wire: that the key reaches every surface, that each number
 * lands under its own name rather than the other's, that a zeroed statement and no statement survive
 * as themselves, and that it marshals for an XML client.
