/**
 * Wire-contract test for issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/305">#305</a>: a citation
 * the MODULE attached says so.
 *
 * <p>The module publishes the chart record an injected {@code safety_finding} fired on whenever the
 * model cites that finding, so the clinician's click-through no longer depends on the model having
 * cited the record. Such a citation is not the model's claim, and two of its properties differ from
 * every citation that existed before: the answer prose carries no {@code [N]} marker for it, so a
 * client that highlights the marker for a clicked chip has nothing to highlight; and its
 * {@code grounded} is always {@code null}, because there is no claim of the model's to check rather
 * than a verdict being withheld.
 *
 * <p>Neither is derivable from the other fields — an unmarked citation is indistinguishable on the
 * wire from one the model listed in its structured array alone, a shape that has always existed and
 * whose own {@code grounded} reads {@code null} too whenever grounding is off or a rule withheld the
 * verdict (those reasons are enumerated once, in ADR Decision 11's {@code grounded} paragraph). So
 * {@code chart} group, no marker and a {@code null} verdict together do not say who cited the
 * record. The fact is published instead, and this is what pins that it reaches the client: without
 * the key the module's own citation reads as the model's, and a {@code null} verdict on it reads as
 * one that could not be verified.
 *
 * <p>Asserted against the real controller's real serialization, on every surface that carries
 * references — the blocking {@code /search} response and all three SSE events — since a client may
 * render any one of them alone. {@code serializeReferences} is shared between them and its javadoc
 * says so; driving all four is what makes that a measurement rather than an argument.
