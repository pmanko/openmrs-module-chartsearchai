/**
 * A bounded pairwise interaction list says so ON THE WIRE (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/336">#336</a>).
 *
 * <p>Measured on the 3.7.1 standalone before this change: a screen found 18 above-floor pairs and
 * reported 10, and the response carried no trace of the other eight — the answer text ended in an
 * ordinary enumeration, the chip array simply stopped, and every
 * {@code references[].withheldInteractions} read {@code 0}. The withheld eight existed in a
 * server-side WARN and nowhere a client could read. So the contract
 * these cases hold is that {@code interactionPairs} reaches EVERY surface that carries chips —
 * there are three — and that the key is present even when nothing was stated, since a client reads
 * it unconditionally.
 *
 * <p>The last case is the one that survives a refactor: the three sites are three because someone
 * counted them today, and a fourth added later would publish chips with no statement beside them
 * unless it goes through the one helper. That is asserted structurally, on the controller's own
 * source, rather than by keeping a list of sites here — the list is what goes stale.
 *
 * <p>The counts themselves are not this class's business: they are pinned through the real
 * {@code validate} by {@code PairChipExtentContextTest}, and their transport to the answer by
 * {@code LlmInferenceServicePairChipExtentTest}. The fixture here states them through
 * {@link PairChipExtent.Sink}, the producer's own channel, because that is the only way to make one.
