/**
 * The chart citations the module found an answer could not have been offering as evidence of an
 * active drug order reach the wire (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/377">#377</a>).
 *
 * <p>On the reported response, three of five interaction sentences cited a condition, a visit and an
 * encounter as the active order they named, and the other two cited the right drug order — so the
 * citations read as uniformly plausible and nothing a client could see separated them. Every
 * reference in it serialized {@code grounded: null}, which is what the #284 carve-out publishes for
 * a chart citation whose sentence also rests on a {@code safety_finding}, so the field a client
 * WOULD have read said nothing about any of the eleven. That is the shape #354 answered for the
 * drug-class note, #336 for the interaction extent and #337 for a degraded rendering, and this key
 * is the same remedy.
 *
 * <p>What the value MEANS — why it is the citation and not a word of the record's text, why an empty
 * list is not a certificate, and which residues the check cannot see — is pinned one layer down by
 * {@code ActiveOrderCitationFidelityTest} and is canonical at
 * {@code ChartAnswer.getMisattributedOrderCitations()}. Here the subject is the wire: that the key
 * reaches every surface, that {@code null} and empty survive as themselves, and that it marshals for
 * an XML client, which is the one shape a list-valued key is already known to break (issue #347).
