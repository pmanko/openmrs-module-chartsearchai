/**
 * Wire contract for the grounding verdict of a {@code reference}-group citation (issue #201):
 * the {@code grounded} key is always present and always {@code null}, at every emission site,
 * whatever verdict the pipeline attached internally.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why the value is withheld rather than published.</strong> Grounding treats
 * module-supplied material as demote-only — a pass renders {@code null}, a Tier-1 off-topic
 * citation still renders {@code false} (#106, #122). That {@code false} is reachable by design, and
 * on the wire it is a value a client must not interpret: it means "this citation is not about that
 * record", which only {@code group} distinguishes from a chart citation's "this claim may not be
 * supported". A client that classified by {@code resourceType} instead rendered it as
 * "Unsupported — The cited record may not support this statement", in red, on this module's own
 * deterministic Major-interaction finding — see
 * {@code ChartSearchAiRestController.groundedForWire} for which client, at which commit, and why
 * the wire was chosen over patching it.
 * A field that must not be interpreted is a trap, so the wire stops offering one. The off-topic
 * signal is not lost to the module — the verifier still computes it and
 * {@code CitationGroundingVerifierTest.safetyFinding_offTopicCitationIsStillFlagged} still pins it —
 * it stops being published to clients that have no correct reading of it.
 *
 * <p>{@code null} rather than an absent key, because {@code null} is already this field's documented
 * value for "grounding disabled or could not run", clients are already told to render it as
 * unverified and never as verified, and the key being unconditionally present is a property clients
 * rely on. Dropping the key would invent a third state for no gain.
 *
 * <p><strong>How this test resists the regression it exists to prevent.</strong> The forbidden shape
 * is a hardcoded list of type names — testing {@code resourceType} against {@code drug_reference} is
 * exactly how {@code safety_finding} was graded as chart evidence for two releases (#122), and
 * re-hardcoding such a carve-out is invisible to a behavioural suite while the hardcoded names still
 * AGREE with the classifier. So the withholding is pinned twice, in two different ways:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li><em>Behaviourally, off an enumeration rather than a literal.</em> The fixture cites EVERY
 * declared {@code RESOURCE_TYPE_*} constant twice — once carrying {@code TRUE}, once carrying
 * {@code FALSE} — and the expectation for each is derived by asking
 * {@link ChartSearchAiUtils#isGroundingDemoteOnly}. No type name appears in the expectation, so a
 * newly declared reference-group constant is swept automatically, and a serializer that agreed with
 * the names it happens to enumerate fails the moment one is added — measured on issue #354, which
 * added a third: the old pair reddens five of the cases below on a {@code drug_class_note} citation.
 * <p>The cost of deriving rather than enumerating, stated so it is not mistaken for coverage this
 * class does not have: both halves ask the same classifier production asks, so if
 * {@code referenceGroup} itself regressed — classifying {@code drug_reference} as chart — every
 * test here would still pass while the wire republished the verdict, which is #201 again. The
 * load-bearing anchor to real type names is {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroupTest}'s hand-recorded
 * group table in the api module, not this class. That is the right division (one place records the
 * decision; everything else derives from it), but it means this class is only as good as that
 * one.</li>
 * <li><em>Structurally, so the hardcode fails TODAY.</em>
 * {@link #theWireSerializerMustNotNameAReferenceGroupResourceType()} reads the controller's own
 * compiled class file and asserts it contains no reference-group type name. Those constants are
 * compile-time {@code String} constants, so javac inlines them into the constant pool of any class
 * that uses one — which makes "this class does not name a resource type" a checkable property, and
 * makes it fail on the mutation rather than three releases after it.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The chart-group half is asserted just as tightly, and is what proves the change NARROWED the
 * wire rather than blanking it: every chart citation's verdict must still arrive, with the value the
 * service attached.
 *
 * <p>Driven through the real controller and its real serialization over real
 * {@code RecordReference} objects, at all four {@code serializeReferences} call sites — the blocking
 * {@code /search} response, the early {@code references} event, {@code done}, and the trailing
 * {@code grounded} event of the async path. They share one serializer today; each is asserted
 * separately anyway, because "they share it" is the thing a client is entitled to have checked.

	 * The structural half. The withholding must be derived from the reference GROUP — through

	 * {@code safety_finding} from the grounding carve-out for two releases (#122), and is the same
	 * mistake the client in #201 made.
	 *
	 * <p>This asserts the property directly, because a behavioural case cannot see a hardcode that
	 * still AGREES with the classifier — which is what a hardcoded pair does for every type it happens
	 * to enumerate. It can see one that has fallen behind, and since issue #354 added a third
	 * reference-group type the fixtures here do: mutate {@code groundedForWire} to the old pair and
	 * read which cases redden. Both halves are wanted; neither subsumes the other.
	 *
	 * <p>{@code RESOURCE_TYPE_*} are compile-time {@code String} constants, so javac
	 * inlines the VALUE into the constant pool of any class that mentions one — whether written as
	 * the constant, as a bare literal, or as a folded concatenation. Scanning every class file the
	 * controller compiles to therefore answers "does this class name a resource type".
	 *
	 * <p>Two limits of the mechanism, stated so nobody has to rediscover them. It is a raw byte
	 * scan, so a wire value that happened to be a SUBSTRING of an unrelated literal would redden
	 * this on an unrelated change — today's values are safe, because what the scan forbids is the two
	 * UNDERSCORED type names and the pool holds no literal containing either, while the bare words
	 * {@code reference} and {@code chart} it does hold ({@code "references"},
	 * {@code "chartsearchai"}, {@code "referenceCount"}, {@code "referenceSliceRecords"} … ) are not
	 * what is searched for. That is the property to check rather than a census of the pool, which
	 * this javadoc carried until #229 added two more strings to it and left the list two short. But
	 * a future single-word type name would want word-delimited matching rather than
	 * this being deleted. And a name computed at runtime would evade it; that is not a plausible
	 * accidental regression, and the shape this exists to catch — {@code type.equals(CONSTANT)} — is
	 * not evadable.
	 *
	 * <p>The controller has no other business naming one: it serializes a wire shape and asks
	 * {@code ChartSearchAiUtils} for every classification decision in it. If a future change needs a
	 * type name here, that is the conversation this test is for.
