/**
 * Wire-contract tests for reference grouping. Every serialized reference carries a
 * {@code group} discriminator derived from its {@code resourceType}, so a client can
 * separate chart evidence from module-supplied reference prose without hardcoding
 * resource-type names, and the flat {@code references} array is ordered so the groups
 * are contiguous (chart evidence first).
 *
 * <p>Driven through the real controller and its real SSE serialization with a stubbed
 * {@link ChartSearchService}, matching this test package's conventions — the assertions
 * are made against the actual emitted JSON, not a reimplementation of the wire shape.
 *
 * <p>The fixture is deliberately adversarial: the injected {@code drug_reference} is
 * FIRST in the service's reference list, so a passing test proves the serializer really
 * reorders rather than accidentally agreeing with input order. The two chart records are
 * given in non-index order (230 before 8) so the test also pins that regrouping is
 * STABLE — whatever order {@code extractCitedReferences} established within a group has to
 * survive.
 *
 * <p>The allergy and the drug reference are null-dated because that is genuinely their shape:
 * an allergy's querystore date is administrative and deliberately unrendered, and an injected
 * drug-reference record never carries one. That pairing is the only situation in which the
 * group sort changes anything at all, since upstream already sorts undated records last. The
 * condition is null-dated purely to give the chart group a second member, so the stability
 * assertion has something to be tight about — a real condition would carry a date. What is
 * pinned here is therefore insertion-order stability, not date ordering.
