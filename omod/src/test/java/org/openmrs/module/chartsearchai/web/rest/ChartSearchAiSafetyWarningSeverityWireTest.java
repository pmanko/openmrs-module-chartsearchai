/**
 * Wire contract for the {@code safetyWarnings} chip object: the rating a chip was RAISED and ORDERED
 * on reaches the client as a field, so that badging a Major differently from a Minor does not mean
 * substring-matching the clinician-facing English inside {@code detail} (issue #340).
 *
 * <p>Before this, {@code ChartSearchAiRestController.serializeSafetyWarnings} wrote {@code type},
 * {@code drug} and {@code detail}, and {@link SafetyWarning#getSeverity()} — public, populated by
 * every rated arm, and the rating the two PAIRWISE arms order their own chips by before
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.maxPairChips} cuts the list — stopped there. The only surviving trace of
 * it on the wire was a word in the middle of prose the module rewords freely, and this repo already
 * carries a reader that has to parse it: {@code eval/drift-metric/score_probe_safety.py}'s
 * {@code CHIP_SEVERITY} regex, whose own comment calls that "the fault issue #207 exists to have
 * removed".
 *
 * <p><b>The prose is not a fallback — though on the shipped dataset it currently looks like one.</b>
 * {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource.noteFor} builds every DDInter note as
 * {@code severity + ". " + mechanism}, or as {@code severity + " severity interaction (…)."} where the
 * row has no mechanism text, and {@code DrugSafetyValidator.interactionWarning} appends that note
 * after an em dash — so over the shipped KB's 590,312 links there is no rated rule whose chip fails
 * to name its rating (measured; no note is null or blank either). What a parse rests on there is only
 * that {@code detail} is prose this module rewords freely. On an operator {@code sourceFormat=json}
 * dataset it breaks outright: note and rating are independently authored, so a rule may carry no note
 * — the branch above appends nothing and the rating is nowhere in the sentence — or one whose leading
 * word is a different rating. Both are pinned, in
 * {@link #theRatingIsPublishedEvenWhereTheProseNamesItNowhere}.
 *
 * <p>Driven through the real controller, at all three ANSWER emission sites: the blocking
 * {@code /search} handler, the SSE {@code done} event, and the {@code grounded} event of the
 * async-grounding path. Since issue #336 those three reach the serializer through
 * {@code putSafetyChips} rather than each naming it, so one edit governs all three — but covering one
 * site would still prove the serializer and not that the other two emit at all, which is the reason
 * {@code ChartSearchAiSearchResponseGroupingTest} exists for its own endpoint. A fourth surface
 * carries chips since issue #280 — {@code GET /chartsearchai/chartalerts} — and is deliberately NOT
 * driven here: it publishes no answer, so nothing above about {@code putSafetyChips} governs it, and
 * {@code ChartSearchAiChartAlertsTest} is its own wire contract. What that class asserts, and what
 * keeps the two surfaces one shape, is that its {@code alerts} objects carry the same keys a
 * {@code /search} chip carries — read off a {@code /search} chip rather than listed. The two SSE sites are also the ones whose ACTUAL JSON can be read back, since the
 * controller serializes those payloads itself with a default {@link ObjectMapper}; so it is there
 * that "the key is present and null" is asserted of the bytes a client receives, rather than of a
 * {@code Map} Spring has not serialized yet.
 *
 * <p>The stubbed {@link ChartSearchService} is this package's established seam for a wire-contract
 * test — {@code omod/pom.xml} declares no {@code chartsearchai-api} test-jar, so the api-side
 * fixtures that drive the real {@code DrugSafetyValidator} are not reachable from here. What that
 * seam leaves to the api suite is that the real arms populate the rating at all, which
 * {@code DrugSafetyQuestionPairInteractionTest} asserts of chips built by the real validator, and
 * which several strength-clause cases depend on besides — null the rating at the arms that build a
 * chip and read the failures rather than trusting a list here, since #283 gave that value a second
 * class of reader. One negative is worth stating because it is the guard a reader would reach for
 * first and it does NOT hold: {@code DrugSafetyInteractionSeverityFloorTest} is not a guard for this
 * at all — it asserts the dataset ROW's rating and the floor's filtering, never a chip's, and stays
 * green under that mutation. What is unique to this class, and missing without it, is whether the
 * value survives the last step.

	 *       cannot produce it, because {@code DdiDrugReferenceSource.noteFor} always writes a note and

	 *   <li>5 — a rating the module does not RECOGNISE, which it treats exactly as it treats null and
	 *       which must still reach the wire as the dataset wrote it.</li>
	 *   <li>6 — a chip whose sentence and rating DISAGREE, which is what makes
	 *       {@link #theRatingIsPublishedEvenWhereTheProseNamesItNowhere} able to tell a field read
	 *       from a parse that falls back to the field.</li>
	 *   <li>7 — a chip carrying a NON-EMPTY {@code chartOrderBridges} (issue #347), and it is here for
	 *       {@link #everyPublicZeroArgumentAccessorOfAWarningNamesAKeyOnTheWire} rather than for a
	 *       case of its own. That guard compares each accessor's own reading against the value the

	 *       without touching an element, so a serializer that RESHAPED the bridges — into maps, or
	 *       into a rendered sentence — passed it. Appended rather than inserted, because the cases
	 *       above index this list positionally.</li>
	 *   <li>8 and 9 — a PAIR carrying one sentence and differing only in
	 *       {@code SafetyWarning.restsOnAnUncorroboratedChartMatch()}, appended for
	 *       {@link #everyPublicZeroArgumentAccessorOfAWarningNamesAKeyOnTheWire} on issue #374. Chip 8
	 *       is here for the reason chip 7 was appended for #347's key — with every chip answering false, a
	 *       hardcoded false agrees with all of them and that guard cannot see it. Chip 9 is the reason

	 * Every accessor a client can read off a {@link SafetyWarning} names a key on the wire.

	 * already stated.</b> Until this change {@code SafetyWarning} documented the opposite for this
	 * very field ({@code getSeverity()}: "Not serialized onto the REST response; the wire shape is
	 * unchanged"), and what it states elsewhere is a different rule — setter/accessor symmetry, "a
	 * caller may set only what it may read back", which is why {@code carriesUnratedRelationship()} and
	 * {@code reconciledPartnerNoteName(..)} are package-private beside package-private factories.
	 * {@code restsOnAnUncorroboratedChartMatch()} stood in that list until issue #374 published it —
	 * see that accessor for why a public read over a package-private write does not breach the rule.
	 * This change removes the counterexample, and
	 * this case is what keeps the next one from being added silently: a value the module computes,
	 * orders chips by, and then drops at serialization is exactly the shape of the defect #340
	 * reports, and it survived from #207 to #340 without anything failing.
	 *
	 * <p><b>What it selects is derived, not listed.</b> A declared method of {@code SafetyWarning}
	 * that is public, non-static, zero-argument and non-void, and is not a redeclaration of a
	 * {@link Object} method. The Object check walks {@code Object.class.getDeclaredMethods()} rather
	 * than asking {@code Object.class.getMethod(name)}, because the latter sees only PUBLIC members —
	 * {@code clone()} and {@code finalize()} are protected, so a future covariant
	 * {@code public SafetyWarning clone()} would slip past a {@code getMethod} form and be demanded
	 * on the wire. The prefix-based {@code getX}/{@code isX} filter this case was first written with
	 * is deliberately NOT used: this class names non-wire accessors of its own that carry neither
	 * prefix, so a prefix rule would stop seeing them the moment one were made public.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It asserts the VALUE and not merely the key, and that is not decoration.</b> Asked only
	 * whether the key is present, the cheapest edit that satisfies it for a newly added accessor is a
	 * hard-coded placeholder — {@code map.put("partnerMoiety", null)} beside the real puts — which is
	 * issue #340's own defect shipped green under a test that appears to cover it. Measured by a
	 * reviewer of this change: with the key-only form, adding a {@code public String getPartnerMoiety()}
	 * returning a constant AND that placeholder put left this class green. Comparing the accessor's own
	 * reading against the published value is what closes it.
	 *
	 * <p><b>It pins that SHAPE, and not every way the defect can recur.</b> An accessor taking a
	 * parameter escapes it ({@code reconciledPartnerNoteName(DrugReference.Interaction)} is one
	 * today), and so does a static one; both are excluded deliberately, because a per-chip wire field
	 * is per-warning and takes no argument. It is ONE-directional — such an accessor implies a key,
	 * never the converse — so a serializer is still free to publish something derived that no
	 * accessor names. And it reads each accessor off THIS fixture's warnings, so a serializer that
	 * agrees with them and diverges on some other warning is outside what it can see. And it reflects over whatever {@code SafetyWarning} the omod build resolved:
	 * {@code omod/pom.xml} unpacks the RESOLVED api artifact over {@code omod/target/classes}, so
	 * under {@code mvn -pl omod test} — the natural command for someone who has just edited
	 * {@code SafetyWarning} — it reads a stale {@code ~/.m2} copy and passes over the very accessor it
	 * exists to catch, silently. Build from the ROOT, which is this repo's standing rule for that
