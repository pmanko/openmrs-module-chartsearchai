/**
 * No text the model produced can become a field line of the SSE frame carrying it.
 *
 * <p>Three channels carry model output as raw text rather than JSON — {@code token},
 * {@code thinking} and {@code preliminary} — and the frame that carries them is assembled by
 * splitting the payload at a line terminator and prefixing each piece with {@code data: }. The
 * event-stream specification recognises CRLF, CR and LF alike as terminators, so a payload holding
 * a lone CR ends its {@code data:} line inside a conforming client and hands the client whatever
 * follows as further fields of the same event: {@code event:} renames it, {@code data:} appends to
 * it, {@code id:} and {@code retry:} set stream state.
 *
 * <p>What that buys an attacker is a forged terminal event. The tests here inject a whole
 * {@code done} frame — an answer that contradicts the real one, with a reference carrying
 * {@code grounded: true}, a verdict the server publishes only after its own verification — because
 * that is the event the clinician's client renders as the answer. The model's text is
 * attacker-influenced on two routes the module accepts by design: chart text any clinician can
 * author reaches the prompt, and a remote OpenAI-compatible endpoint is an untrusted network peer.
 *
 * <p>The CR reaches this layer as a literal character, not as an escape: {@code LlmProviderTest}'s
 * {@code streamingConsumer_shouldDecodeControlCharEscapes} and
 * {@code streamingConsumer_shouldDecodeUnicodeCarriageReturnEscape} pin both JSON spellings —
 * {@code \r} and a unicode escape of the same code point — decoding to one, which the strict
 * {@code json_schema} response format permits a grammar-constrained model to emit. So the payloads
 * below are the strings that arrive, and the question this class asks is only what the framing does
 * with them.
 *
 * <p>Every assertion reads the stream through {@link SseEvents}, which decodes the way the
 * specification says a client must; that is what makes these assertions about what a client SEES
 * rather than about what the controller intended. → ADR Decision 101.
