/**
 * Issue #450 — the {@code chartsearchai_audit_log} row for a STREAMING query, when the stream does
 * not finish.
 *
 * <p>The row used to be a statement on the success path, so a user holding <em>AI Query Patient
 * Data</em> could read a streamed answer about any patient, reset the socket, and leave no record of
 * who asked what about whom. ADR Decision 105 is canonical for why that happened and for what the
 * fix files; these cases are what pins it.
 *
 * <p>They drive {@code streamAnswer} — the production entry point the package's other STREAMING
 * audit tests use — over {@link DisconnectingSink}, and each disconnect case asserts the sink actually
 * refused something: without that the pipeline RETURNS instead of unwinding and the case silently becomes a
 * duplicate of the happy path, which the neighbouring audit tests already cover.
 *
 * <p>No OpenMRS {@code Context} is installed, deliberately, as in
 * {@code ChartSearchAiStreamEventOrderTest} — {@code streamAnswer} is contract-bound to be free of
 * {@code Context} reads and a fallback audit write that re-added one would throw here rather than
 * read a leaked stub. See {@code RestControllerContext}'s javadoc for why that absence is the
 * enforcement.
