 * Tests for the streaming search endpoint controller structure.
 * Verifies that the controller writes SSE events directly to the response
 * on the request thread, and shares no auth state with any other thread.
 *
 * <p>"On the request thread" rather than "without background threads": the SSE keep-alive runs a
 * timer that writes comment frames, and what matters is that no thread but the request thread does
 * OpenMRS work — see {@link #streamingEndpoint_shouldNotRunOpenmrsWorkOnBackgroundThreads}, which
 * states and enforces that scope. Letting that timer in added a second thing to guard, so the same
 * method also pins the mechanism that keeps its writes inside the request: the stop flag must be
 * read, not merely set.</p>
 *
 * <p>Threads and auth state are not the whole of it, and saying so is the point: this is the only
 * test class that reads the controller's own SOURCE, so it is also where the keep-alive's
 * source-level facts live: that the production entry point passes the interval CONSTANT, and that
 * the timer is scheduled at a fixed DELAY. Neither is about threads, and a javadoc naming only
 * threads and auth sends the next reader looking elsewhere for them.</p>

	/**
	 * No thread but the request thread may do OpenMRS work, and no authentication state may be shared
	 * across threads.
	 *
	 * <p>This test forbade {@code new Thread(} outright until the SSE keep-alive was added. The ban
	 * was narrowed rather than dropped, because the reason for it is the one the other three
	 * assertions here name: OpenMRS binds authentication to the request thread, so work done off that
	 * thread either loses its {@code Context} or shares it unsafely. A timer that only writes bytes to
	 * the response carries none of that risk, and forbidding it cost the streaming endpoint its only
	 * defence against a reverse proxy's read timeout — measured on the chartsearchai.openmrs.org demo
	 * 2026-08-19, a query whose first output lands after that window is closed having delivered ZERO
	 * bytes, with no error event and no audit row: silent, and indistinguishable from a hung origin.
	 * Cloudflare cuts at ~120s, stock nginx at 60s.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>So the scope is now stated instead of assumed: a thread must be created here at all, every
	 * {@code new Thread(} and every {@code Executors} call in this controller must be the keep-alive's,
	 * {@code SseKeepAlive} must not touch {@code Context}, {@code Context} must stay QUALIFIED
	 * throughout this file, and {@code write} must READ the stop flag that {@code stop} sets. A thread
	 * created either of those two ways and doing OpenMRS work fails here, which is what the original
	 * assertion was protecting.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>Those two spellings are named rather than "every thread this controller creates" because they
	 * are what the scan actually reaches, and each is decided by WHERE the creation sits. Both halves of
	 * that were missing once and each was measured passing the whole suite. A factory-less
	 * {@code Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor} in this class running
	 * {@code Context.getAuthenticatedUser} went green because the default thread factory writes no
	 * {@code new Thread(} for the loop to find; and a raw
	 * {@code new Thread(runnable, "chartsearchai-sse-keepalive")} outside {@code SseKeepAlive}, running
	 * that same read, went green at 85 of 85 because the loop matches on the name literal, and reddened
	 * only once its name was changed. So the name is asserted for what a name is worth — a thread that
	 * identifies itself in a dump — and the two count assertions are what say a thread is the
	 * keep-alive's. A thread can still arrive by a route neither spelling reaches
	 * ({@code new Timer()}, {@code CompletableFuture.runAsync}, a Spring-managed pool), and stating
	 * that is the point — a guard whose message claims more than it checks is the same silent weakening
	 * as a region that reads short.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>The {@code Context} scan had a third hole of the same shape, and it is a SPELLING rather than
	 * a location: the needle is the text {@code Context.}, so a static import of
	 * {@code Context.getAuthenticatedUser} lets the keep-alive read authentication state as a bare
	 * {@code getAuthenticatedUser()} and the scan never sees it. Measured 2026-08-20, both directions:
	 * that read placed after the write in {@code SseKeepAlive.write} left omod green at 85 of 85, and
	 * the identical read spelled {@code Context.getAuthenticatedUser()} failed the scan and nothing
	 * else — so the scan works and it was the spelling that admitted it. The remedy is the import
	 * assertion below, which is deliberately over the WHOLE file rather than the class body, since an
	 * import sits above it; it needs no region canary, because the positive thread-creation assertion
	 * at the top of this method already fails if the source ever reads empty. Placement matters to the measurement and not to the hole: the same read put BEFORE
	 * the write reddens six behavioural cases instead, because then no comment is ever written, which
	 * is the case {@code RestControllerContext}'s javadoc records.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>One route past the pair of them is left, and naming it is the same discipline as naming
	 * {@code new Timer()} above: a helper METHOD elsewhere in this controller that reads
	 * {@code Context} and is called from inside {@code SseKeepAlive}. The qualified read then sits
	 * outside the class body, so the scan scoped to that body does not see it, and no import is
	 * involved for the assertion below to catch. Closing that needs a call graph rather than a text
	 * scan, so it is stated instead.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>The stop-flag assertion is a text check rather than a behavioural one because the property
	 * cannot be reddened behaviourally: with the read gone, a task parked on the {@code out} monitor
	 * during the terminal write is free to write after {@code streamAnswer} has returned, but whether
	 * it does turns on a monitor race against {@code stop()} that no test can force, so a behavioural
	 * case would fail only probabilistically. Before this assertion existed, deleting
	 * {@code if (stopped)} from {@code SseKeepAlive.write} left the omod suite green at 81/81 — the
	 * flag's write half pinned by the region canary and its read half by nothing, which is exactly the
	 * silent weakening that canary's own message names.</p>
