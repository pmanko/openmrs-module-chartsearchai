/**
 * A contraindication chip says whether the chart match behind it is corroborated (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/374">#374</a>).
 *
 * <p>Issue #309 gave a CONDITION contraindication rule a corroborating leg, so the injected
 * {@code drug_reference} record and the {@code safety_finding} beside it both hedge a rule whose
 * token reached a recorded condition only mid-word. The clinician-facing chip did not: the module
 * held the answer on {@code SafetyWarning.restsOnAnUncorroboratedChartMatch()} and nothing a
 * {@code /search} consumer reads carried it, so on that issue's own reproduction the two surfaces
 * disagreed about one chart — the records hedging and the chip asserting.
 *
 * <p><b>Three guards over one key, and none of them subsumes another.</b> The case here reads the
 * published value off the SSE bytes for three chips, two of which carry ONE sentence, which is
 * the defect stated as behaviour. The source pin below asserts the value is READ off the accessor
 * rather than recomputed beside it, which no value comparison can see. And
 * {@code ChartSearchAiSafetyWarningSeverityWireTest}'s reflective guard compares every public
 * accessor's own reading against the key it names, over a fixture that since #374 carries a chip
 * answering true — which is what generalises the comparison past this class's own chips. Mutate
 * the serializer's put and read all three.
 *
 * <p>Two things are deliberately NOT asserted here, each because something else already holds them.
 * That the key reaches {@code GET /chartsearchai/chartalerts} is
 * {@code ChartSearchAiChartAlertsTest.everyFindingIsShapedExactlyAsASearchChipIs}, which reads the key
 * set off a live {@code /search} chip rather than listing it — a hand-written list here is the thing
 * that case's javadoc forbids. And that the payload still marshals for an XML client is
 * {@code ChartSearchAiChartOrderBridgeTest.theWholePayloadStillMarshalsForAnXmlClient} through the
 * shared {@code XmlPayloads.assertMarshals}; this key adds no new hazard there, and
 * {@code ChartSearchAiRestController.serializeSafetyWarnings} is canonical for why.
