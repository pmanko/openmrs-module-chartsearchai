/**
 * The citations whose rendering the module found unfaithful reach the wire (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/337">#337</a>, second
 * round).
 *
 * <p>PR #345 gave the module an instrument for the defect and it fires on real answers — the issue's
 * own comment records it naming a live divergence where {@code naproxen} came back as
 * {@code naproxenic}. What it did not do is make the divergence visible to anyone but a maintainer
 * reading a log: the degraded sentence still reached the clinician carrying a citation marker, with
 * nothing in the response saying the marker's own record reads otherwise. That is the shape #354
 * answered for the drug-class note and #336 for the interaction extent, and this key is the same
 * remedy.
 *
 * <p>What the value MEANS — why it is the citation and not a word of the record's prose, and what an
 * empty list does not say — is pinned one layer down by {@code ReferenceProseFidelityTest}, and is
 * canonical at {@code ChartAnswer.getUnfaithfullyRenderedCitations()}. Here the subject is the wire:
 * that the key reaches every surface, that {@code null} and empty survive as themselves, and that it
 * marshals for an XML client, which is the one shape a list-valued key is already known to break
 * (issue #347).
