/**
 * A question that named a drug CLASS the module could not resolve says so ON THE WIRE (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/354">#354</a>).
 *
 * <p>#354 blesses two outcomes and this change takes the second — the module states that the
 * question named a class and asks for a specific drug. Its deterministic half is one injected
 * {@code drug_class_note} record, and that record reaches a client only if the MODEL cites it: the
 * {@code /search} response returns cited references and nothing else. Measured on the issue's own
 * reproduction, the model cited nothing and answered "The records do not address starting an oral
 * contraceptive for this patient." — so nothing a {@code /search} consumer reads reported the class
 * at all, and the only delta was an audit-log column that consumer cannot see.
 *
 * <p>So the module states it itself, on the same three surfaces {@code interactionPairs} reaches and
 * for the same reason issue #336 put that key there: a safety statement that is only as reliable as
 * the wording of a generated answer is not a statement. These cases hold the key present on every
 * one of them — including the EARLY {@code done}, which with async grounding is the event a user
 * actually sees — and hold it structurally for a surface nobody has written yet.
 *
 * <p>What the value MEANS, and that it is read off the injected chart rather than by asking the
 * question a second time, is pinned one layer down by
 * {@code LlmInferenceServiceUnresolvedDrugClassTest}. Here the subject is the wire.
