/**
 * The dosing ceiling an answer quoted, and the stricter one it left unstated, reach the wire (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/276">#276</a>).
 *
 * <p>On the reported response the answer led with a substance's canonical row ceiling — forty times
 * the one published for the presentation the patient was charted on — cited the record that stated
 * both numbers, and nothing a client could read said so. Issue #274 had already put the stricter
 * number into that record; what it did not settle is which one the answer leads with, and the chips
 * cannot say either: the overdose arm compares a DOSE against a ceiling and
 * {@code DrugSafetyValidator.LIMIT_CUE} exists precisely so a recited ceiling is invisible to it.
 * That is the shape #354 answered for the drug-class note, #336 for the interaction extent, #377 for
 * a misattributed citation and #337 for a dropped rating, and this key is the same remedy.
 *
 * <p>What the value MEANS — that it is not a claim the answer is WRONG, why an empty list is not a
 * certificate, and which residues the check cannot see — is pinned one layer down by
 * {@code DosingCeilingFidelityTest} and is canonical at
 * {@code ChartSearchService.UnstatedDosingCeiling}. Here the subject is the wire: that the key
 * reaches every surface, that its three fields are spelled {@code citation}, {@code statedCeiling}
 * and {@code unstatedCeiling}, that {@code null} and empty survive as themselves, and that it
 * marshals for an XML client, which is the one shape a list-valued key is already known to break
 * (issue #347).
