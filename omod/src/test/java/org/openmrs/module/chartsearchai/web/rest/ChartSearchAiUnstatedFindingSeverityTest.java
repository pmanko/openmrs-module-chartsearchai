/**
 * The safety findings whose RATING an answer states nowhere reach the wire (issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/337">#337</a>, round
 * three).
 *
 * <p>On the reported response five interaction findings were enumerated flat with no rating stated
 * for any of them, two of them Major, and nothing a client could read said so: the chips carried
 * every rating correctly but are a parallel list nothing reconciles against the prose, and
 * {@code unfaithfullyRenderedCitations} correctly read {@code []} because the round-two check
 * reports a substitution inside a reproduction and this answer reproduced nothing. That is the shape
 * #354 answered for the drug-class note, #336 for the interaction extent and #377 for a
 * misattributed citation, and this key is the same remedy.
 *
 * <p>Each entry carries the RATING beside the citation since issue
 * <a href="https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/issues/387">#387</a>. Before it
 * the key was a bare index list, and a client told which citations were missing a rating could not
 * learn which rating: the chips hold every rating and no citation index, and {@code (type, drug)}
 * identifies no one finding — all five on the reproduction being
 * {@code (interaction, Clarithromycin)}. That pairing is what this file's assertions are now about.
 *
 * <p>What the value MEANS — why it is the citation and the rating and not a word of either text, why
 * an empty list is not a certificate, and which residues the check cannot see — is pinned one layer
 * down by {@code SafetyFindingSeverityFidelityTest} and is canonical at
 * {@code ChartSearchService.UnstatedFindingSeverity}. Here the subject is the wire: that the key
 * reaches every surface, that its two fields are spelled {@code citation} and {@code rating} — the
 * second deliberately NOT {@code severity}, which is a chip's raw field and a different value — that
 * {@code null} and empty survive as themselves, and that it marshals for an XML client, which is the
 * one shape a list-valued key is already known to break (issue #347).
