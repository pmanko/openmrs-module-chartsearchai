/**
 * What {@link ChartSearchAiRestController} logged, and at what LEVEL — for the cases in this
 * package whose subject is the level rather than the return value.
 *
 * <p><b>Deliberately not {@code org.openmrs.module.chartsearchai.LogCapture}</b>, which is the
 * repo's general instrument for this question and would be the obvious reuse. It lives in
 * {@code api/src/test}, and reaching it from here means publishing an api test-jar and depending
 * on it — which was tried and reverted on this change: it opens api's whole test classpath to
 * omod, and prose in both modules states the opposite as a load-bearing fact. The one that decides
 * is a PRODUCTION javadoc: {@code DrugSafetyValidator}'s {@code StandingChartAlerts} factories are
 * public because {@code omod/pom.xml} declares no api test-jar. ADR Decision 105 names the rest. One
 * level assertion does not buy that. So this asks the one question those cases need, over one
 * logger, and claims to be no general instrument — {@code LogCapture} is that, and its javadoc is
 * where the reasoning about levels as the only observable lives.
 *
 * <p>Shared rather than nested per test class, the reason {@code StubAuditLogService} and
 * {@code CapturingAuditLogService} each give about themselves: two copies let two files quietly
 * pin different answers to the same question, and this one is used by both a positive assertion
 * (an ERROR is reported) and a negative one (no log line carries the question or the answer).
 *
 * <p><b>It raises the logger CONFIG, not the instance, and undoes an INSTALLED config rather than
 * only a level</b> — both of which it takes from {@code LogCapture}, which had each of them wrong
 * once. {@code Logger.setLevel} reaches only the one instance, which is why {@link Configurator} is
 * what raises the level here. And attaching an appender to a logger that has no config of its own
 * makes log4j2 install one: removing only the appender and the level then leaves that config behind
 * at its inherited level for the life of the JVM, so a later capture of the PACKAGE is blind to this
 * logger's events below it and every negative asserted over such a capture passes vacuously,
 * decided by nothing but which test file surefire ran first. That is issue #439's third review round,
 * pinned there by {@code LogCaptureRestorationTest} — which cannot see this class, so
 * {@code ChartSearchAiAuditWriteFailureLoudnessTest.aCloseLeavesNoLoggerConfigBehind} is what keeps
 * it pinned here.
