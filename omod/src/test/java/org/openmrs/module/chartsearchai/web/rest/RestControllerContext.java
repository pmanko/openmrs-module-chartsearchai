/**
 * The static OpenMRS context the BLOCKING {@code /search} handler needs, installed and torn down as
 * one unit. Driving that handler needs more than the SSE path does: a privileged {@link UserContext},
 * plus a {@link PatientService} and an {@link AdministrationService} in the {@link ServiceContext}.
 *
 * <p>Shared rather than copied per test class, for the reason {@link StubAuditLogService}'s javadoc
 * gives about itself: a copy per file lets two files quietly pin different answers to the same
 * question. Here that question is <em>what an unconfigured installation replies to a global-property
 * read</em> — which is the premise of the tests that use this, so a stale copy would keep passing
 * while describing an install nobody has.
 *
 * <p>Restoring matters as much as installing: surefire runs this module in a single reused JVM with
 * no configured {@code runOrder}, so a leaked service silently alters whichever classes happen to
 * run afterwards. What it would cost here is specific — several classes in this package
 * ({@code ChartSearchAiStreamEventOrderTest}, {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroupingTest},
 * {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceProvenanceTest}, and the contextless tests of
 * {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroundingWithholdingTest} and
 * {@code ChartSearchAiSafetyWarningSeverityWireTest}) drive {@code streamAnswer} with NO
 * context at all, and on the REQUEST thread that is the only thing enforcing its "free of
 * {@code Context} reads" contract: a re-added global-property read throws because nothing is
 * installed. A leaked stub answers instead of throwing, and they go green over exactly the drift
 * issue #178 removed. The last two install this fixture around their blocking-endpoint work and
 * restore it in a {@code finally} rather than an {@code @AfterEach}, precisely so their own SSE
 * tests keep running contextless — {@code ChartSearchAiReferenceGroundingWithholdingTest} around its
 * single such test, and {@code ChartSearchAiSafetyWarningSeverityWireTest} inside the helper every
 * one of its blocking-endpoint cases calls, so the install and the restore cannot come apart however
 * many of them there are.
 *
 * <p>"On the REQUEST thread" is a limit rather than a hedge. It does not reach the SSE keep-alive's
 * own thread, whose two catches swallow whatever a {@code Context} read throws there. Measured
 * 2026-08-19: a {@code Context.getAuthenticatedUser()} placed AFTER the write in
 * {@code SseKeepAlive.write} leaves the whole omod suite green and is caught only by
 * {@code ChartSearchAiStreamingTest}'s scan for {@code Context.} inside that class, while the same
 * read placed BEFORE the write reddens six behavioural cases instead, because then no comment is ever
 * written at all and six cases there assert that one was. So on that thread the source scan is the
 * enforcement and this absence is not.
 *
 * <p>{@link #restore()} cannot simply put back "nothing", because {@code ServiceContext} has no
 * removal API and its {@code setService} returns silently when handed a null. So when there was no
 * prior service, restore installs a {@link #refusing} stand-in whose every method throws — which is
 * what an absent service behaves like, and keeps that contract enforced rather than merely claimed.
