/**
 * Decodes the SSE wire format the controller writes, for the streaming tests in this package.
 *
 * <p>Shared because two test classes had each grown their own decoder and they had already
 * drifted: one stripped the single space after {@code data:} and the other kept it, and they split
 * events differently (blank-line blocks versus scanning to the next {@code event:}). Jackson
 * tolerated the difference, so nothing failed — which is exactly why it needed removing rather
 * than fixing twice.
 *
 * <p><b>It decodes the way the event-stream specification says a client must, and that is the
 * point of it rather than a detail.</b> The decoder this replaced recognised only LF as a line
 * terminator, while the spec recognises CRLF, CR and LF alike — so a lone CR written into a frame's
 * payload ends the {@code data:} line for a client that follows that grammar, and turns what follows into further
 * field lines of that same event, and a LF-only decoder cannot see it happen. That is the finding
 * {@link ChartSearchAiSseFrameInjectionTest} pins, and it was invisible to this package until this
 * class was the thing a conforming client would do. Field parsing (name up to the first colon, one
 * optional leading space dropped from the value, {@code data:} lines joined with LF, a line opening
 * with {@code :} skipped as a comment) follows the same specification for the same reason.
 *
 * <p>So when a test here asserts an event's type, it is asserting what a client PARSES, not what
 * the controller passed to {@code writeSseEvent} — which is the only form of that assertion worth
 * anything on a payload the model wrote.
 *
 * <p><b>It is not a general-purpose SSE client, and two deviations are named here so nobody reads it
 * as one.</b> A frame with no {@code event:} field is dropped, where the specification dispatches it
 * as {@code message}; and a typed frame with no {@code data:} line is dispatched, where the
 * specification does not. Neither is reachable from the writer under test, which always emits an
 * {@code event:} line and at least one {@code data:} line — so closing them would add branches no test
 * could discriminate.
