/**
 * Decodes the SSE wire format the controller writes, for the streaming tests in this package.
 *
 * <p>Shared because two test classes had each grown their own decoder and they had already
 * drifted: one stripped the single space after {@code data:} and the other kept it, and they split
 * events differently (blank-line blocks versus scanning to the next {@code event:}). Jackson
 * tolerated the difference, so nothing failed — which is exactly why it needed removing rather
 * than fixing twice. The implementation below is the original blank-line-block decoder, moved
 * verbatim so the assertions that already relied on it cannot shift.
 *
 * <p>The single space after {@code event:}/{@code data:} is part of the field delimiter the
 * controller emits ({@code writeSseEvent} writes {@code "data: "}), not payload, so it is dropped.
