# POSIX sh, because backend-init.sh is `#!/bin/sh` and runs under dash in the backend image. In

# script's own names — backend-init.sh reuses `_url` for a JDBC value and runs two of these fetches
# in parallel background subshells.
#
# Sourced, never executed. Callers:
#   backend-init.sh ............... . /usr/local/bin/model-manifest.sh
#   build-standalone.yml .......... . chartsearchai-backend/scripts/model-manifest.sh
#   ModelDownloadIntegrityTest .... drives it with /bin/sh against a loopback HTTP server

# Where the digests live. The default is the path Dockerfile.backend COPYs the manifest to; the
# workflow and the test both point this at their own checkout.

# It carries the artifact id and the code from the table below, and nothing else. A PATH in it would
# publish for unverified bytes exactly what require_verified withholds. What it is FOR is the second
# premise of ADR Decision 106's amendment: on a deployment whose container log nobody in the loop
# can read, a blanked path says chart search is off and says nothing about why, so a digest refusal,
# a missing manifest row and a failed transfer are one state seen from outside. The entrypoint
# records this in a global property that is readable over REST.
#
# fetch_and_verify does not write it. The weights go through that one in background subshells, whose
# variables reach no parent shell, so an entry there would be recorded for the embedder and lost for
# the weights — one name answering for two behaviours. The weights' outcome has a channel of its own
# instead: backend-init.sh records it per artifact from those subshells and publishes it as

#   2  size mismatch — the file has been deleted, and the caller has a better diagnostic than we do
#   3  the fetch or the placement failed with nothing at the target to begin with, so nothing was
#      verified and nothing was deleted (a non-2xx response is here, because curl runs with -f)
#   4  the artifact could not be resolved, so nothing was fetched: no such id in the manifest, no
#      manifest to read it from, an override with no digest, or — require_url_for_digest — a
#      digest with no url of its own

# It returns rather than exiting, and what keeps that fail-closed is the LEDGER, not the exit: a

# configure_retrieval_gps WITHDRAWS the embedder paths — and wherever that withdrawal cannot be
# confirmed to have landed, puts the copy on the volume out of reach instead, which is the only
# instrument left when the row cannot be blanked. Withholding the write alone would not have been
# enough once the start continues — a row an earlier good start wrote stands whatever this start
# did, and codes 3, 4 and 5 delete nothing, so it can still name a file that is still there.
# Unverified bytes answering a clinical question is the state Decision 106 removes; stopping the
